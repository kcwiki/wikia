Well, after a little more than two months I can safely say that I am a lazy bum. So, let's list some achievments I accomplished during my period of radio silence.Â 



1. Finished Winter 2016 Event. All of it.

After participating in one other event (that being Fall 2015), I can now proudly proclaim that I finished an event, through and through. Now I have Hatsuzuki, and Zara. Yesss.

2. Like, 5 new Kai Ni's

Kitakami, Ooi, Shigure, Maya, and Kongou are now all at full potential, with most of them (not Maya, I Kai Ni's her last night) at full modernization. So much yes.

3. The never ending sludge through World 5.

Working through World 5 is, to say the least, painful. Painful enough that it forced me to take recuperation days to let my fleet rest and stock on more buckets as Spring 2016 looms ever closer. I want Harusame damn it! Let me get to World 6!

Thanks for looking at my page, as this isn't the most interesting.



and I promise I'll post more...
