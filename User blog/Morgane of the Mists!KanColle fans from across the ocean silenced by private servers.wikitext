A few days ago, a rogue Chinese private server successfully shut down several of the largest KanColle fansites in China, leaving nearly a hundred thousand Chinese KanColle fans homeless.

This private server accomplished their action by bribing Baidu with a large sum of cash (700k RMB) and purchasing administrator rights at these websites, ousting the original KanColle fans. They then proceeded to shut down these fansites and advertise only their own rogue private servers. 

Even now, Chinese KanColle fans are trying to take their community back. Despite the rogue server's connections with authorities and attempts to suppress all discussion, word still got out - it's how people like me knew. 

The discussion can be found here in [http://www.himeuta.net/f5-kancolle-discussion/3329-chinese-kancolle-baidu-fiasco.html Himeuta] , where a summary of the events could be found. This event is well-documented in [http://zh.moegirl.org/70%E4%B8%87%E9%83%BD%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E4%BD%A0%E8%BF%98%E6%83%B3%E5%BD%93%E5%90%A7%E4%B8%BB Mandarin Chinese] . Please help spread the word to your friends, other KanColle fans, and gaming media outlets. Events like these affect all of us (if NOTHING else, Kadokawa is aware and watching this), and it's times like this where we need to come together to show solidarity for each other and the franchise that we all know and love.
