Spring Event is nearly to come, currently I'm lack of resource after celebrating my completion of school internship program with LSC. So, I'm spamming 30/30/30/30 for daily construction in order to conservate my resource for the [[File:Bakareso1.jpg|thumb|left|400px|My Current Resource]]upcoming spring event. 







My current resource (19 April 2015, 12.52 JST).[[File:2nd_Yuubari.png|thumb|400px|2nd Yuubari]]



This is my 2nd Yuubari that I've got from default recipe 30/30/30/30. (Is this kind of lucky or what?)

But I'm kinda miss my first CV, Zuikaku that sunk at 1st April at 2-4 BOSS. I thought it was an april fools joke that at 2nd April at morning I woke and see my ZuiZui at her pajamas. But... She's not come back. Until now I'm wasting many of my resource in search for ZuiZui again. But what I've got is a bunch of Zui............ hou. Not my lovely ZuiZui, [[File:1styuubari.jpg|thumb|400px|My First Yuubari]]DAMN YOU RNG!!!

In my first journal, I dedicate it for my lovely ZuiZui[[File:RIP_Zui.jpg|thumb|400px|Zuikaku Tombstone]]. So, I put her tombstone here.
