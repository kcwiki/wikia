Heya, gonna try a new format for my reports this time around.
==Resources==
26k{{Fuel}} 19.3k{{Ammo}} 13.4k{{Steel}} 25.6k{{Bauxite}}

After 5 failed 4/6/7/2 20 LSC runs, I'm gonna start doing them weekly. Curse you RNG, give me my Germans already.

Anyways, due to the strain on my resources, I'm going to start doing them weekly, instead of at a certain point in rsc.


==Ships==
Mutsuki is now at 47

Akashi was Kai'd today, the 7th

Zara is 33

Musashi is 47

Farming on 3-4 for Hiryuu

No new additions to the fleet


==Maps==
I managed ONE KILL on the Wa-class at 5-3. It's a start

Finished 1-5

I also am working on 1-6 and 2-5 


==Other==
I have alot of ships to repair. And I mean, like, a good page and a half of chuuha and taiha. And the main problem is, I don't remember why. RIP fuel and steel

Also spent around 8000 furniture coins on nice lookin' stuff. Can't wait for the summer season to start. Furniture's gonna like nice. and other things ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
