===Dislcaimer: This post is for jokes and fun... There's no need to follow this guide at all. You've been warned.===



Was there a need for a guide to fail on events? There's really no need for such guide...

But, if you want to truly fail on fashion... I can help you a bit on that.



==1. Start the event on the last day of the event.==
Of course, you'll fail this event if you start on the tentative last day that the devs has given for the completion of the event. so... even if you try to clear it for the next 24 hours; chances are you might not finish it... (then again, some people get lucky enough to clear it...)




Just pray that the event won't extend... or most likely, you'll clear it.




Anyways, it won't work if you are picky with your means and you hate losing via timeout.






==2. Do the event on Hard mode... and stick to it.==
Hard mode can be a pain to deal with... of course we know why... It's because it's Hard mode.




The only risk for the said method is that you might actually clear the said event... so do use weak ships late-game for maximum effect.




It's not recommended for people who are HQ levels 1 to 79... because they haven't unlock Hard mode yet.






==3. use meme fleets... during event times.==
Are you a fan of Nishimura fleet? A fan of Mutsuki-only fleet? A fan of Foreign Fleet? A fan of Megane fleet? Then you can use that excuse to totally not clear the event... at least you have some fun.




The only risk is that you might clear the said event despite the challenge you imposed on yourself... and might as well gain popularity along the way...




It's not recommended to those who are F2P platyers.






==4. Play other games parallel to Kancolle event==
Are ypi good at juggling?

Are you good at playing multiple games at the same time?

Are you skilled with your hands?

Then, you have no worries.... just set the difficulty to hard mode and you will most likely not able to clear hard mode of KanColle event.




The risk of doing that is... your eyes being badly hurt due to multi-tasking... but then again, its fine since if you can't play, you will be able to fail Kancolle's event.




It's not recommended for people who plays Auto-clear games.






==5. Fail the event by not playing Kancolle at all.==
This is the easiest and the most effective method to use... since you don't have to do anything at all to fail.




The risk however is that... if by some reason you decide to play... you might have a chance to clear it.




It's not recommeded for players who made Kancolle a part of their habit.






==6. Do the event with 0 resources==
If you are somewhat a gamer who can't leave Kancolle... might as well do the 0 reso challenge, you start with nothing and try to clear the event while managing your resources which is close to be called exhausted.




The risk of the said method is that, some people did clear the event on 0 resources mode... but, that is only a small fraction of the population so your chances of failing with that method is still hgih




Not recommended to players who save a lot...






==7. Prioritize Real Life over KanColle==
As much as this goes... Real life has to be prioritized... it's not the player's fault that he is busy during those times... at least, it's an opportunity for you to totally fail this event by dedicating yourself towards real life activities.




The risk is that, if you by some reason, still managed to play Kancolle despite your real life commitments... chances are, you might clear it.




Not recommended for people who don't have a life...

And these are the few methods to fail the event... hope you can fail your event soon... and if you somehow managed to clear the event despite these methods...
