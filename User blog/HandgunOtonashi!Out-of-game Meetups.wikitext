Just like the title says, post experiences with other Kancolle players out of game here! This includes up-and-coming envents. This can also include just random chatter, as long as it starts from an out-of-game experience. I'll start.



To the people that were at Animazement a few days ago. o7 (That's a salute, for those of you non-EVE online players....) Was great seeing you guys there. I was really hoping to see more Kancolle cosplay/booths, but I guess it hasn't really reached the states yet. :(

On the up-and-coming note, we have a Kantai only convention happening September 6th, in Charleston, on the deck of the U.S.S Yorktown (CV 10). I plan on going, is anyone else?
