okay since kancolleXarpeggio event getting closer...

i want to know why you guys(anons and registered) wanted arpeggio girls stay on kancolle

is it because they're OP equipment so you could hammer those princess/demon-tier alien ships to pieces without breaking a sweat?

or its because some of you guys have a dirty fantasies about those arpeggio girls so having them in your base could fuel your fantasies to some extent?

or maybe because you're a villain type of admiral so you could monopolize the seas alongside pretty girls?

or do you have another reason? tell me (and the whole kancolle wikia visitor) by posting them here!
