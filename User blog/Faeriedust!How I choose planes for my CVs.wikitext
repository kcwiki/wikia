Some people ask me how to choose planes for my CVs.. and I probly pick a pick differently than most..

Here is list of my priorities that I go through.

#Do I have at least one bomber per CV?
#Am I at least at FP cap on all my CVs for parallel engagement? If no, can I use another CV? If no, can I use a different CV?
#Do I have enough yellow plane? (at least 1, usually do about 1 yellow per 3 bombers, round up/down on convenience)
#Do I have AS/AS+? If no, can I use another CV? If no, can I use a different CV?
#Do I have more slots available? (Put bombers.)

For placement, I do greens on largest slots, yellows on smallest slots, unless I'm familiar enough with the map to do otherwise.

Lol people seem to think slot sizes are everything on CV, but they're absolute last important thing for me.. only affect the "can i use diffferent CV?" at end of last step, which I rarely reach. ;P

Hiryuu is god! <3

UPDATE: This was before planes had ranks.. My thinking has changed considerably since.. Will update later.
