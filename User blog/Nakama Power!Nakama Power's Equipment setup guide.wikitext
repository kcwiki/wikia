ver. 3.0
=='''Introduction'''==
Hello fellow Admirals! Welcome to my Equipment Setup Guide.

This guide should help you understand what each Ship types pros and cons are and what setups you should have for each situation and also provide a little information on some of the mechanics                                         

'''Just as a General Rule: '''

#'''There is no one Equipment setup you should always have(its not a one size fits all)'''
#'''For newer Admiral's/Teitokus(TTK) it is advisable to remove your spare equips from Ships that you will scrap/modernise or currently not using for sortie or PVP'''
#'''There are other Hybrid builds not stated in this guide, feel free to test some yourselves'''



===Artillery Spotting===
Artillery Spotting allows you to do '''Daytime Double Attack(DA) or Daytime Cut-in(CI)''' for ships that have a seaplane/bomber[[File:Seaplane.png]] equipped

*This means that, ships that can't equip seaplanes, will be unable to do Artillery spotting

*Ships such as DD,CLT,CV/L,AV,AAS,SS/V and specific CL's cannot perform Artillery Spotting

*To achieve artillery spotting, you need to achieve Air Superiority(AS) or Air Supremacy(AS+)

*Achieving  AS/AS+ require you to have 1.5 x Fighter Power(AS) or 3 x Fighter Power(AS+) compared to the enemy Fleet

*When facing an enemy fleet with no Carriers (or BBV/CAV/AV for PVP) you can achieve AS+ aslong as you have a Bomber[[File:Seaplane.png]] or Carrier Planes[[File:GreenPlane.png]][[File:RedPlane.png]][[File:BluePlane.png]]equipped



===Anti Submarine Warfare(ASW)/Opening Anti Submarine Warfare(OASW)===
As the name suggests Anti Submarine Warfare is generally associated with Equipment and stats with ships that can attack Submarines

*At the current time only DD,DE,CL,CLT,CVL,BBV,CAV and AV can attack submarines

*Most of the time when a submarine is present it will force said ships to attack it first, the only exception is with BBV,CAV and AV where they can only attack them when they have a Seaplane Bomber [[File:Seaplane.png]] Equipped

*Also during Night Battle where planes cant be launched, BBV, CAV and AV will not attack submarines at night

*ASW damage calculation is mostly affected by Equipment stats over a ships Base ASW stat

*OASW is a new mechanic added that lets ships (yours or abbysals) to attack submarines prior to the opening torpedo phase. The Requirements are that they have a total ASW stat of 100 or more (65+ for Taiyou) and have a Sonar [[File:Sonar.png]] or Depth Charge [[File:DepthCharge.png]] equipped (Except for Taiyou and Isuzu)



===Anti Air Cut-in(AACI)===
Anti Air Cut-in is a mechanic that was introduced with the introduction of the Akizuki Class, When Triggered it can shoot down Enemy bombers which can help reduce Opening Airstrike Damage or even destroy all the enemy Bombers

*The higher a ships Anti Air (AA) [[File:Icon AA.png]] stat the higher the activation rate

*Only one AACI can be activated per round of Opening Airstrike

*The game also have Ship Priorities when you have more than one ship with AACI setup present in your fleet

*If memory serves me right Maya has the highest priority and Akizuki class has the lowest,

*This just means if you have two ships with AACI setup,
*Example 1 - You have Maya and Yuudachi, if both ships trigger AACI then Maya has the higher priority to do AACI
*Example 2 - You have Akizuki and Yuudachi, if both ships trigger AACI then Yuudachi has a higher priority

*This however should not be an issue if you only have 1 ship with AACI setup, as it can be disadvantageous for a ship with weaker AA stat to perform AACI



===Destroyer (DD)===


*DD's are known for their High Evasion, Support role and also great for Anti-sub warfare(ASW) [[File:Icon ASW.png]]
*They also have a low fuel/ammo consumption rate to compensate for their Low Firepower(FP)[[File:Icon Gun.png]] and Armor [[File:Icon Armor.png]]
*DD's have a drastic increase in Night battle Damage
*Auxillary items such as Radars[[File:Radar.png]] and Night Battle Equips [[File:FlareIcon.png]][[File:Searchlight.png]] are interchangeable
*DD's will prioritise targeting an enemy submarine if present
*Try and Level up your DD's as they are required for 3-2 Branching rules, Light Fleet maps, Combined fleet mechanics, Support Expeditions, etc.
*Around 4-6 Highly leveled DD's are recommended (more to prepare for shiplocking and when tackling higher difficulties)
*'''Special Mention goes to Mutsuki/Asashio class kai ni and Verniy (Beppy) as they can equip Daihatsu Landing Craft [[File:LandingCraft.png]]'''
*They have also recently added Coastal Defense ships (DE) which are Destoyer-like but have lower ASW requirements to perform OASW

<tabber>
Night DA= 
*This is the typical setup for all DD's and both [[File:RedGunLight.png]] and [[File:GreenGunDP.png]] are interchangeable. 
*This setup will provide a Night Double attack(DA) which is reliable(High activation rate)
*'''DO NOT PUT A 3RD GUN OR A TORPEDO IN THE LAST SLOT AS THIS WILL CHANGE IT FROM DA SETUP TO CI SETUP'''
[[File:Night_DA.jpg]]
|-|Night CI= 
*The activation for a Night CI relies heavily in your ship's LUK [[File:Icon Luck.png]] stat
*'''30 LUK[[File:Icon Luck.png]] is the minimum amount before you should even consider using this setup'''
*If you have a Skilled Sentry[[File:Ssp c.png]] equipped this will increase the activation rate allowing Low LUK [[File:Icon Luck.png]] DD's to use this setup
*You can put a 3rd Torpedo in the last slot if you are need all the damage you can get

[[File:Night_CI.jpg]]
|-|AACI=
*This setup helps with Anti-air defense by doing an Anti-Air Cut-in(AACI)
*For AACI you need a 91/94 Firedirector [[File:Aafd c.png]] or 10cm HA+FD [[File:GreenGunDP.png]] equipped
*When activated, you will shoot down more enemy planes reducing their opening airstrike damage. 
*Air Radar [[File:Radar.png]] is shown to increase the activation rate of AACI 
*You can actually shoot down all the bomber planes of an enemy carrier and render them useless.

'''You can sacrifice Night DA by changing 1[[File:GreenGunDP.png]] for an Air[[File:Radar.png]] to increase AACI activation rate.'''

[[File:AACI_Basic.jpg]]

And the more Advanced Setup is 1 x 10cm HA+FD [[File:GreenGunDP.png]] + 10cm HA [[File:GreenGunDP.png]] + 13 Air Radar Kai [[File:Radar.png]]

[[File:AACI_Advanced.jpg]]
|-|ASW=
*All Destroyers are great for ASW [[File:Icon ASW.png]]
*'''Having a Sonar + Depth Charge (DC) equipped at the same time (ASW Combo) increases the overall DMG by 15%.'''
*This means that having 2 x Sonar [[File:Sonar.png]] + 1 DC [[File:DepthCharge.png]] is more effective than 3 x Sonar [[File:Sonar.png]]
[[File:ASW.jpg]]
|-|Hybrid=
*There are a lot of Hybrid builds, but this is the most common one
*The Night CI dmg output is reduced a little bit (130% for mixed CI compared to 150% when using a Torp CI build)
*'''This setup allows for AACI and Night CI and is most effective with High LUK [[File:Icon Luck.png]] DD's w/ decent AA [[File:Icon AA.png]] stat'''
[[File:Hybrid_DD.jpg]]

</tabber>



===Light Cruiser (CL)===


*CL's are able to equip medium guns[[File:RedGunMedium.png]] and seaplanes[[File:Seaplane.png]]
*Just like a DD, CL's are also great for ASW [[File:Icon ASW.png]]
*Yuubari, Isuzu,Tenryuu and Tatsuta does not have plane slots [[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] and can't equip seaplanes
*CL's also have a drastic increase in Night Battle Damage
*'''A special mention goes to Abukuma and Yura for being able to equip Type A Ko-hyoteki[[File:Torpedo.png]] and Daihatsu Landing Craft [[File:LandingCraft.png]] (Kinu can also equip Daihatsu)'''
*'''A special mention goes to Ooyodo/Yuubari for having 4 equipment slots'''
*CL's also prioritise targeting enemy submarines if present
*'''Try and get 2-3 CL's at a decent level. Combined Fleet mechanics need at least 1 CL, and the emergence of Light fleet maps make them more necessary than before'''


<tabber>
Day/Night DA=
*This is the general setup for CL's when facing normal surface fleets.
*This setup lets your CL's do Daytime DA if you activate Artillery Spotting
*Like the DD setup this one provides a strong and reliable Night DA aswell
*'''When you can't activate Artillery Spotting, you may exchange your Seaplane [[File:Seaplane.png]] with a Radar[[File:Radar.png]] or Night Battle Equips [[File:FlareIcon.png]][[File:Searchlight.png]]. This means no Daytime DA but Night DA only'''
*'''There was an update which gave FIT bonus when equipping the right caliber guns on CLs'''
[[File:CL_Day_DA.jpg]]
|-|Day CI/Night DA=
*This is the general setup for CL's when they are supporting whilst you're powerleveling
*'''Daytime CI has a higher activation rate and Accuracy(ACC)[[File:Icon Hit.png]] than Daytime DA but is weaker.'''
*You also need to activate Artillery Spotting to do Day CI.
*You may use any of the secondary guns[[File:GreenGunDP.png]][[File:YellowGun.png]]
[[File:CL_Day_CI.jpg]]
|-|ASW=
*'''Just like DD's, CL's are also great against enemy subs'''
[[File:CL_ASW.jpg]]
|-|Ooyodo/Yuubari=
*Ooyodo and Yuubari are Special CL's in that they have 4 Equipment slots
*It should also be noted that with the Addition of OASW, Ooyodo currently cannot achieve 100+ ASW because of her low ASW stat
*'''Yuubari does not have any plane slots[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] and can't equip seaplanes [[File:Seaplane.png]], therefore no Daytime DA/CI'''
*You can put a Radar[[File:Radar.png]] which increases Daytime DA/CI chance or Night Battle Equips[[File:FlareIcon.png]][[File:Searchlight.png]] on their spare slot to supplement the earlier setups
*'''Make sure you put the seaplane in the right slot (Ooyodo's 1st and 4th Slot does not have a plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]])'''
[[File:Ooyodo_Day_DA.jpg]]

'''Compared to the other CL's, these two are Specialists in ASW[[File:Icon ASW.png]] because ASW equipment gives 10x more DMG than the raw ASW stat of the Ship'''
[[File:Ooyodo_ASW.jpg]]
|-|Ooyodo/Yuubari Hybrid=
*Even though Yuubari cannot equip seaplanes[[File:Seaplane.png]] and do Artillery Spotting, she is still useful for Night DA '''(Her stats are inferior so be mindful when using her)'''
*This is a common used hybrid build good for ASW[[File:Icon ASW.png]] and deals decent Night DA
[[File:Ooyodo_Hybrid.jpg]]
|-| Abukuma/Yura=
*Both Ships are special because of their ability to equip Type A Ko-hyoteki[[File:Torpedo.png]]
*This setup allows them to turn into a pseudo CLT and still be classified as a CL for branching purposes
*This setup allows them to perform Opening Torpedo and have decent Day single attack and Deadly Night DA
*Yura also has the ability to equip Seaplane Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] or Seaplane Fighters [[File:Seaplane_Fighter_Icon.png]]
[[File:AbukumaCLT.jpg]]
</tabber>



===Torpedo Cruiser (CLT)===


*CLT is a Subclass-type of Light Cruisers (they do not qualify as CL's for branching purposes)
*'''CLT's sacrifised their ability to perform Artillery Spotting by being able to Launch an Opening Torpedo Salvo aslong as you have a Type A Ko-hyoteki[[File:Torpedo.png]] equipped'''
*CLT's are DEADLY at night battle because of their Decent FP [[File:Icon Gun.png]] and having the Highest Torpedo [[File:Icon Torpedo.png]] stat in the game
*In contrast to their offense, they have paper thin armor [[File:Icon Armor.png]]
*CLT's still are one of the best ship classes in the game
*They are great for PVP, support when Powerleveling, Combined fleet, Map clearing, and are known for being event boss killers.
*They will also prioritise targeting enemy submarines if present
*It is advisable to get at least 2 Highly leveled CLT's (if not all 3 of them)

<tabber>
Night DA=
*This is the typical setup for all CLT's
*Decent single attack during the Day and a deadly Night DA
*This setup is recommended against High HP [[File:Icon HP.png]] and armor [[File:Icon Armor.png]] bosses
*Main guns[[File:RedGunMedium.png]] and Secondary guns [[File:YellowGun.png]] are interchangeable
[[File:CLT_Night_DA.jpg]]
|-| Night CI=
*'''This setup is only viable to Kitakami(KTKM) due to her base 30 LUK [[File:Icon Luck.png]]'''
*This setup maximizes Torpedo [[File:Icon Torpedo.png]] DMG
*It provides a powerful Night CI (stronger than night DA) but the activation rate is lower compared to DA setup and is unreliable 
*This is sometimes used to kill off an Event boss that has High Amor/HP
[[File:CLT_Night_CI.jpg]]
|-| ASW=
*When in maps where you only fight submarines you can have the same setup as a full ASW CL
*This is a hybrid setup that provides Opening Torpedo and decent ASW [[File:Icon ASW.png]] 
*'''This setup is especially effective for 4-3 powerleveling'''
[[File:CLT_ASW.jpg]]
</tabber>



===Heavy Cruiser (CA)===


*CA's see the introduction to 4 equipment slots after remodelling
*All CA's have the ability to equip seaplanes [[File:Seaplane.png]] for Artillery Spotting
*Whilst they are limited to Medium [[File:RedGunMedium.png]], their High FP [[File:Icon Gun.png]] can make them good replacements for BB's if they are unavailable or overkill
*Recieves a huge ACC [[File:Icon Hit.png]] bonus at night when equipped with 20.3 cm (no.#) [[File:RedGunMedium.png]]
*CA's are able to equip Sanshiki/Type 3 Shell [[File:GreenAmmo.png]]
*CA's have an improved Night Battle DMG
*CA's are used more and more in EVENT MAPs fleet compositions, having a minimum of 4-5 CA's highly leveled is recommended
*'''Special Mention goes to Zara/Pola as Italian Ships can equip Seaplane Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] or Seaplane Fighters [[File:Seaplane_Fighter_Icon.png]]'''

<tabber>
Day/Night DA= 
*This is the standard setup for CA's
*Has strong Day DA due to Artillery spotting and a strong Night DA
*'''You can swap the Radar [[File:Radar.png]] with Night Battle equips [[File:FlareIcon.png]][[File:Searchlight.png]] (this will reduce the Day DA chance)'''
[[File:CA_Day_DA.jpg]]
|-|Day CI/Night DA=
*This setup is useful when they are supporting while you're Powerleveling
*'''Daytime CI has a higher activation rate and Accuracy(ACC)[[File:Icon Hit.png]] than Daytime DA but is weaker.'''
*You also need to activate Artillery Spotting to do Day CI.
*You may use any of the secondary guns[[File:GreenGunDP.png]][[File:YellowGun.png]]
[[File:CA_Day_CI.jpg]]
|-|Day DA/Night CI=
*This setup is only viable to ships with High LUK [[File:Icon Luck.png]] (eg. Prinz or Myouko)
*This setup provides a Strong Day DA and a Strong Night CI
*'''Again Night CI is not as reliable as Night DA setup'''
[[File:CA_Night_CI.jpg]]
|-|Anti-Installation setup =
*This setup is great against '''Installation type bosses (eg Hoppou, Seaport Hime, etc.)'''
*Still the same setup as your typical Day DA build but with a Sanshiki/Type 3 Shell [[File:GreenAmmo.png]] instead of the radar [[File:Radar.png]]
[[File:CA_Type_3.jpg]]
|-|AACI Hybrid=
*This setup is Optimized for CA's with High AA [[File:Icon AA.png]] (eg. Maya)
*'''It provides Day CI/AACI/Night DA'''
*This setup is slightly weaker but helps with Anti-air defense
*'''You must equip either 12.7cm HA+FD / 90mm HA[[File:GreenGunDP.png]] or 25mm (concentrated deployment) [[File:GreenGunMG.png]] with the latter only working for Maya''' 
*An Air [[File:Radar.png]] increases the chance of AACI activating
[[File:CA_Hybrid.jpg]]
</tabber>



===Aviation Cruiser (CAV)===


*CAV's are a Subclass-type of Heavy Cruisers and have the same equipment setup as CA's
*CAV's have a slightly weaker FP [[File:Icon Gun.png]] than CA's but they gain the ability to Equip Seaplane Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]]
*Seaplane Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] help with the Opening Air Strike and can also provide small Fighter Power (to help achieve AS) depending on the Bomber's AA [[File:Icon AA.png]] stat
*When you have a Bomber [[File:Seaplane.png]] equipped, If there is an enemy submarine present your CAV will be forced to attack it during the Day (cannot launch planes at night)
*If its disadvantageous being forced to attack the enemy subs, you can swap it for a normal Seaplane[[File:Seaplane.png]] (and have the same setup as a normal CA)
*Just like Heavy Cruisers, CAV's also have an improved Night Battle DMG
*When facing a enemy fleet without Carriers, you can achieve AS+ if you have bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] equipped
*The importance of CAV's is increasing with better routing for event maps.
*It is recommended to get a minimum of 2 Highly leveled CAV's

<tabber>
Day/Night DA=
*This is the same setup as a CA's replacing the seaplane[[File:Seaplane.png]] with a bomber [[File:Seaplane.png]]
*'''Whenever you equip bombers/planes be wary on the plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] (try and put them on the biggest slot)'''

*Again you can swap the Radar [[File:Radar.png]] for a Night Battle equip [[File:FlareIcon.png]][[File:Searchlight.png]]
[[File:CAV_Day_DA.jpg]]
|-| Day CI/Night DA=
*This is the same setup as a CA's replacing the seaplane[[File:Seaplane.png]] with a bomber [[File:Seaplane.png]]
*This setup is useful when your supporting whilst powerleveling
*'''Whenever you equip bombers/planes be wary on the plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] (try and put them on the biggest slot)'''
[[File:CAV_Day_CI.jpg]]
|-| Anti-Installation setup=
*This setup is great against '''Installation type bosses (eg Hoppou, Seaport Hime, etc.)'''
*Still the same setup as your typical Day DA build but with a Sanshiki/Type 3 Shell [[File:GreenAmmo.png]] instead of the radar [[File:Radar.png]]
*'''Whenever you equip bombers/planes be wary on the plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] (try and put them on the biggest slot)'''
[[File:CAV_Type_3.jpg]]
|-|ASW=
*Whenever CAV's have Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] or Autogyro [[File:Heli.png]] they can attack submarines
*This setup allows for the Highest possible ASW DMG for CAV's
*Autogyro [[File:Heli.png]] is a rare equipment that you can only get from Akitsumaru Kai (LSC ship) so you can use Zuiun (634) [[File:Seaplane.png]] as a replacement till then
[[File:CAV_ASW.jpg]]
</tabber>



===Battleship (BB)===

*BB's are the queens of the battlefield (however they cannot attack submarines)
*BB's have the highest FP [[File:Icon Gun.png]] HP [[File:Icon HP.png]] Armor [[File:Icon Armor.png]], in exchange for ASW [[File:Icon ASW.png]] and Torpedo [[File:Icon Torpedo.png]]
*BB's are able to equip Large [[File:RedGunHeavy.png]] and Armor Piercing Shells (AP) [[File:RedAmmo.png]]
*Having a BB present in either side grants a second shelling phase
*There are 2 classifications for Battleships, your Slow Battleships (BB) and your Fast Battleships (FBB)
*The main differences between the two are the fuel/ammo consumption, route branching and what guns they can equip
*There is an Overweight penalty introduced for BB's that suggests that having the correct gun can provide an accuracy boost, and having an overweight gun can reduce your accuracy
*While the exact details is still unclear, having many 46cm [[File:RedGunHeavy.png]] equipped is not recommended for FBB's
*'''Special Mention goes to Bismarck and Gangut as the only Battleships to have Torpedo[[File:Icon Torpedo.png]] stat'''
*'''Special Mention goes to Littorio/Italia and Roma as Italian ships can equip Seaplane Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] or Seaplane Fighters [[File:Seaplane_Fighter_Icon.png]]'''
*'''Special Mention also goes to Nagato/Yamato Class as they can equip Seaplane Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] or Seaplane Fighters [[File:Seaplane_Fighter_Icon.png]]'''
<tabber>
Armor Piercing Setup=
*'''This is the Ideal setup for Battleships'''
*Having an AP shell [[File:RedAmmo.png]] equipped can help deal with high armor [[File:Icon Armor.png]] enemies
*This setup allows for a strong Day DA or CI (mixed result) and Night DA
[[File:BB_AP.jpg]]
|-|Day DA=
*Same setup as a Heavy cruiser
*Only necessary if you are lacking AP [[File:RedAmmo.png]] or lacking accuracy [[File:Icon Hit.png]].
*'''Can also be used to help with LOS [[File:Icon LOS.png]] for branching purposes.'''
[[File:BB_DA.jpg]]
|-|Day CI=
*This setup is useful when supporting for powerleveling to '''prevent stealing MVP'''
[[File:BB_CI.jpg]]
|-|Anti-Installation setup=
*This setup is great against '''Installation type bosses (eg Hoppou, Seaport Hime, etc.)'''
[[File:BB_Type_3.jpg]]
|-|Bismarck Hybrid=
*This setup is can only be used by Bismarck Drei
*This is similar to the CA Day DA/Night CI setup
[[File:BB_Bismarck_Drei.jpg]]
</tabber>



===Aviation Battleships (BBV)===

*BBV's are a Subclass-type of Battleships
*They have lower HP [[File:Icon HP.png]] and Armor [[File:Icon Armor.png]] than regular BB/FBB's
*In return they have gained the ability to equip Seaplane Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]]
*Like Aviation Cruisers, BBV's can help with Opening Air strike and AS when you equip Bombers[[File:Seaplane.png]]
*When facing a enemy fleet without Carriers, you can achieve AS+ if you have bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] equipped
*If there is an enemy submarine present and you have a bomber equipped, BBV's are forced to attack them during the day.
*If disadvantageous, consider using a normal seaplane [[File:Seaplane.png]]


<tabber>
Armor-Piercing Setup=
*Same setup as your BB's with the exception of Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]]
*'''Whenever you equip bombers/planes be wary on the plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] (try and put them on the biggest slot)'''
[[File:BBV_AP.jpg]]
|-|Day DA=
*Same setup as your BB's with the exception of Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]]
*'''Whenever you equip bombers/planes be wary on the plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] (try and put them on the biggest slot)'''
[[File:BBV_DA.jpg]]
|-|Day CI=
*This setup is useful when your supporting whilst powerleveling
*'''Whenever you equip bombers/planes be wary on the plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] (try and put them on the biggest slot)'''
[[File:BBV_CI.jpg]]
|-|Anti-Installation setup=
*This setup is great against '''Installation type bosses (eg Hoppou, Seaport Hime, etc.)'''
*'''Whenever you equip bombers/planes be wary on the plane count[[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] (try and put them on the biggest slot)'''
[[File:BBV_Type_3.jpg]]
|-|ASW=
*Whenever BBV's have Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] or Autogyro [[File:Heli.png]] they can attack submarines
*For BBV's you can have all 4 Autogyros [[File:Heli.png]] to deal the highest possible ASW [[File:Icon ASW.png]] DMG.
*'''For 1-5 it is advisable to bring a BBV to enable 2nd Shelling phase and also attack submarines'''
[[File:BBV_ASW.jpg]]
</tabber>


===Seaplane Tender (AV)===

*At this moment there are only 5 Ships that are classified as AV class (Chitose,Chiyoda,Akitsushima,Mizuho and Commandant Teste)
*There are equipments that Chitose/Chiyoda/Mizuho can equip and Akitsushima can't and vice versa
*'''Special Mention goes to Commandant Teste as the only AV with 4 Equipment Slots'''
*This is a fragile class with minimal use outside of Expeditions at the moment
*Chitose/Chiyoda/Mizuho can equip Daihatsu Landing Craft [[File:LandingCraft.png]] which increases resources gained from expeditions by 5%
*Akitsushima is the only ship that can equip Type 2 Large Boat [[File:FlyingBoat L.png]] and other than LOS and branching rules, any hidden uses are currently unknown

<tabber>
Preemptive Strike setup=
*'''This is currently the only effective setup for AV's'''
*You can swap a Bomber [[File:Seaplane.png]] for another Type A [[File:Torpedo.png]]
*This setup gives you an Opening Airstrike and an Opening Torpedo Salvo
[[File:AV_Opening_setup.jpg]]
|-| ASW=
*They can also target subs whenever they have Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] equipped
*'''AV's can equip Depth Charges [[File:DepthCharge.png]] to help improve ASW DMG'''
*Although Type 0 Passive Sonar [[File:Sonar.png]] was only a Ranking reward and unobtainable, equipping this with a Depth Charge [[File:DepthCharge.png]] can provide the 15% ASW bonus
[[File:AV_ASW.jpg]]
|-| Night DA=
*This setup allows AVs to become a mini-CLT
'''Mizuhos stats are decent enough to make this setup viable'''
[[File:AV_Night_DA.jpg]]
</tabber>



===Submarines (SS/V)===

*Submarines (SS) has the least fuel/ammo consumption of any ship type
*SS are limited to Opening/Closing Torpedo Salvo and Night Battle Torpedo Salvo or Torpedo CI
*SS also has the lowest repair cost and repair time
*Prior to reaching Level 10 SS cannot do an Opening Torpedo salvo w/o a Type A [[File:Torpedo.png]]
*When remodelled they turn into Submarine Aircraft Carrier (SSV)
*They will then gain access to Bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]] in exchange for doubling their repair times
*Submarines forces enemy DD/CL/CLT/CVL(FS only) and other Abyssals that carry bombers (except CV class)
*Submarines are one of the most important ships in game. They become a tank to help reduce repair cost for Powerleveling, allows you to Orel/Bashi cruise to help gain resources, required for branching purposes for 6-1 and also required for some expeditions
*'''Special Mention goes to Hitomi and Iyo for having 3 Equipment slots'''

<tabber>
Night Torpedo CI=
*This is the general setup for SSV's (Ro-500/U-511 stays as an SS with 2 slots even after remodel)
*Torpedo CI is still relies heavily on you ships LUK [[File:Icon Luck.png]] meaning '''Goya and Yu/Ro-chan are the most effective submarines'''
*When needing survival you can sacrifice a Torp CI setup and swap a Torpedo [[File:Torpedo.png]] for a Damecon [[File:EmergencyRepair.png]] instead.
[[File:Sub_CI.jpg]]
|-| Aerial Bombing setup=
*This setup is only useful for 3-2 powerleveling or if in need of LOS for branching purposes
*Opening Air strike may destroy DD/CL for earlier maps
*'''SSV's have low plane slots [[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] and enemies will shoot them down easily, however the bauxite cost to resupply them is minimal'''
[[File:Sub_Airstrike.jpg]]
</tabber>



===Standard Aircraft Carrier (CV) / Light Aircraft Carrier (CVL)===

*Aircraft Carriers (CV) are one of the most important ships ingame
*They provide Fighter Power which helps gain AS/AS+ for Artillery Spotting
*CV's have the highest plane slots [[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] of any ships (with the exception of Unryuu-class ships)
*They have decent HP [[File:Icon HP.png]] in exchange for their low Evasion [[File:Icon Evasion.png]]
* Light Carriers (CVL) have lower plane slots [[File:Icon Aircraft.png]] and HP [[File:Icon HP.png]] than your normal CV's but in exchange they gain the ability to attack submarines
*CV/L's provides an Opening Airstrike which can deal DMG or help shootdown enemy planes depending on your setup (submarines cannot be hit by the Opening Airstrike)
*CV/L's can only attack (launch planes) during daytime and cannot attack when they are Moderately Damaged (Orange/Red) 
*'''Special Mention goes to Taiyou as the only CVL that can be used in Transport Combined fleets and perform OASW'''
*CVB is a Subclass of CV's and can launch planes even when they are Moderately Damaged (Orange)
*At the time of this writing only 4 Ships are classified as CVB (Taihou,Shoukaku,Zuikaku and Saratoga)
*At the moment only Shoukaku and Zuikaku can equip Jet Planes
*Whenever you face an enemy fleet w/o enemy Carriers, you can achieve AS/AS+ aslong as you have [[File:GreenPlane.png]][[File:RedPlane.png]][[File:BluePlane.png]] Planes equipped

<tabber>
Plane Introduction=
'''There are 5 types of planes'''
# Fighter Planes [[File:GreenPlane.png]] = Provides AA which helps gain Fighter Power to achieve AS/AS+
# Torpedo Bombers [[File:BluePlane.png]] = Provides a strong Opening Airstrike and allows Day Shelling
