==E-1: Farming Map==

[[File:Zel_Fall_2016_E-1.png]]

'''Route: '''A-C-F-H-L

'''Difficulty''': Hard

'''Reasoning and Alternatives'''
*This fleet is made for the purpose of both farming and clearing at the same time. Basically, extremely slow chipping runs.
**This map requires fast fleet and enough eLoS for the shortest route.
*fBB is there for the 2nd shelling
*CVL is there for both bombing and to provide Saiun just in case
*DD and CL are there for you know what.

Alternatively, you can remove CVL for another DD and BB for another CAV and you'll still be able to clear the map, but the farming part will be harder. Consider this when you're planning on whether you want to keep your CVL/fBB for later or not.

'''Notable Drops'''
*{{ShipLink|Kashima}}
*{{ShipLink|Uranami}}

==E-2: Land Base Map ==

[[File:Zel_Fall_2016_E-2.png]]

'''Route: '''C-G-J-I-K-O
'''Difficulty''': Hard

'''Reasoning and Alternatives'''
*Souryuu and Hiryuu for branching
*Haguro and Myoukou were chosen for E-3 branching in the future
*Teruzuki for AACI
*Ushio just because

'''Notable Drops'''
*{{ShipLink|Yamakaze}} - 2nd Run
*{{ShipLink|Isokaze}}
*{{ShipLink|Kawakaze}}
*Shitload of {{ShipLink|Suzuya}} and {{ShipLink|Kumano}} x 6
==E-3: Gandalf Map==

[[File:Zel_Fall_2016_E-3.png]]

'''Route: '''B-E-H-I-L

'''Difficulty''': Hard

'''Debuff?''': Yes, but wasn't needed. It was a pain to do it just for testing...

'''Notable Drops'''
*{{ShipLink|Amatsukaze}}
*{{ShipLink|Tanikaze}}

==E-4: Hell Ma....wait no....please see below==

'''Full name''': Hell map? No, it's "Tanaka you fucking lied it's fucking 6 maps and this is the final map holy fucking abyssal christ wtf were you smoking when you made E4H?"

'''Difficulty''': Hard --> Normal

Stop me if you heard this one before. So-gang, Ru-bershop Quartet, and Queen Hime and her Fuck-you goons walk into Tanaka and say, "LET'S FUCK THEM UP!". In Hard, this map takes the difficulty to another level. Insane Air power that got jacked up on last dance, trolling submarine of death, the death wall of 4 Rus that you usually see back in 2-4 and shit but now as pre-boss and meeting the Air node again...not to mention you can only send a single fleet to find a FUCKING COMBINED FLEET. This map is a combination of all the "sad" thing in Kancolle into one map. Honestly, I won't be surprised if it's map made from a dare that devs made to each other.

===Transport Phase===
