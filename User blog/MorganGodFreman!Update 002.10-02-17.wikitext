Pre-Event Update:

Fuel - 107k

Ammo - 105k

Steel - 218k

Boxite - 41k

Buckets - 322

Preperations for the Winter 2017 event are nearly complete as I wait for the remaining hours to tick by until the maintenance. I have succeeded in leveling a great many ships including Choukai, Maya, Shoukaku & Zuikaku, Abukuma, ect. to their desired level before the start of the event. However I managed to do this without sacrificing to many resources in the process. I will most lively be completing E-3 of this event on normal, but non-the-less will attempt my first full Hard clear. My only hope from this event is to see a great many foreign ships to be drops, since I am still yet to have Graf, either Pasta BB's,Warspite, or Iowa. Other hopefuls are Akatsushima, Amagi, and Katsuragi. I know that not all will be in the event since this is a small event, but I am hopeful none-the-less.

Good luck my fellow admirals, and my luck be ever in your favor.
