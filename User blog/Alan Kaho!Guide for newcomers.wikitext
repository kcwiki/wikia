*Plane can rank up with [[Aircraft Proficiency]]
**{{RedPlane}}{{BluePlane}}{{Seaplane}}Bomber generally be put in large planes slot to avoid losing rank and stronger opening air-strike.
*All ships capable of attacking submarines will '''prioritize''' attacking submarines first, so ships like DD, CL, CVL(and CAV/BBV/AV if they equipped with seaplane bomber)''' will ignore surface ships and attack submarine'''.
**Ships with 0 displayed ASW stat or CVL/CAV/BBV/AV only equipping planes with no ASW stat are incapable of attacking submarines.
*CVLs and CVs '''can't attack''' in shelling phase when in chuuha/taiha state, so you might want to repair them if they in chuuha state.

*[[Combat/Day Combat#Opening Torpedo Salvo|Opening Torpedo Salvo]]: a preemptive torpedo attack before entering shelling phase
**Any ship equipped with [[Type A Kouhyouteki]]: SS(V),CLT,most AV,[[Yura]],[[Abukuma]]
**level 10+ submarine can perform it without [[Type A Kouhyouteki]]


==Anti-Submarine Warfare(ASW)==

*Beside the common {{Sonar}}+{{DepthCharge}} synergy, there is {{DepthCharge}}DC(Depth charge)  +{{DepthCharge}} DCP(Depth charge projector) synergy
**Use combo {{Sonar}}Sonar + {{DepthCharge}}DC +  {{DepthCharge}} DCP for best damage modifiers
**DCP:	[[Type 3 Depth Charge Projector]] , [[Type 94 Depth Charge Projector]]
**DC: [[Type 95 Depth Charge]] . [[Type 2 Depth Charge]]
*[[Partials/Opening ASW|OASW]]: a preemptive attack against submarine before entering shelling phase
*Pioritize OASW over synergy.
*bring (F)BB(V) for 2nd shelling if needed
*Any enemy submarines survive the day battle '''will be unsinkable''' in night battle (unless its [[Combat/Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]] sorties).

<div class="floatright">[[File:Raid_node.png]]<br><div style="font-size:12px">An air raid node</div></div>
*Detail: [[Combat/Aerial Combat#Anti-Air Cut-In|AACI]]
*AACI is used for an easier time getting thought Air-raid node and Arial Battle Node (to deal with opening air-strike in general)
Note that:
*Only one ship can perform in each battle, if more than one ship use AACI set, they will be rolled and checked separately.
*{{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}} have unique and best AACI but lowest priority in-game, if put with other ship with AACI set, their AACI will be checked last. 
**Never pair Akizuki-class AACI with other ship AACI
**Only exception is {{ShipLink|Maya Kai Ni}} AACI, since {{ShipLink|Maya Kai Ni}} AACI is as strong as {{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}} AACI

*[[Combat/Aerial Combat#Plane AA Resist Modifiers|Plane AA Resist Modifiers]]
===Big 7's Special Cut-in attack:"Touch"===
*After the the debut of {{ShipLink|Nelson|text=Nelson}} and her special attack "Nelson touch" in [[Early Fall 2018 Event]], the game slowly added similar special attack to other big-7 battleships in the game({{ShipLink|Nagato Kai Ni|text=Nagato}} ,{{ShipLink|Mutsu|text=Mutsu}}, {{ShipLink|Colorado|text=Colorado}}).
* The special cut-in attack (commonly called as "touch") can trigger in shelling phase when the said battleships put in flagship position and the fleet meets certain requirements. Requirements are different depending on which battleship you put as flagship. (go to battleship's respective pages to check their requirements)
*When triggered, within the flagship shelling turn, the flagship and 1 or 2 other ships will fire 3 random salvos at the enemy fleet.
