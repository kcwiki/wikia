Hello

As of the last report, I have gotten Kinugasa Kai Ni, Hiei Kai Ni, and LSC'd a Musashi. Three greatly needed additions to the fleet. I also Kai'd Suzuya, and am currently focusing on leveling destroyers, mainly Mutsuki. I have also recovered my resources, and am currently floating around 36300 {{Fuel}}, 31000 {{Ammo}}, 21200 {{Steel}}, 28400 {{Bauxite}}, and 205 Buckets. I plan on reporting weekly from now on till the next event.
