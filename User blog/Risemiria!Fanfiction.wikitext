Sooo, I've pretty much completed the prologue of the story I've been working on.  I believe I mentioned my desire to write a story on the general discussion page and I've also decided to post the story here on the wiki (since all of us here have a mutual interest).  To be honest, it's been a while since I wrote any sort of fanfiction so I think I've gotten a little rusty, but anyway, I'll be posting the prologue (and first chapter subsequently) very soon.
