- In a certain Naval base in Saiki-bay Anchorage.




T: Say Samidare, Is August 10 the date?

Samidare: Yes.

T: damn, It's not too early and the lateness of itÂ  makes me want to sleep until it's time.

Samidare: ?

T: sorry but, waiting for it makes me want to tick.

Samidare: ?

T: Hmm, Sorry. But I guess I need to work hard for the sake of all you here in the naval base.

Samidare: Thanks, You are surely lazy. but it's better than the clumsy me.

T: It's true. I'm lazy and aims too high. But I can only do that because I have faith in you guys. Because of that even a lazy bum like me can work hard because I had beautiful maidens around me who believes in me.

Samidare: (blushes) Yeah. That's right, you're doing it for all of us. But Let me remind you that what you are thinking makes people like you sent behind bars.

T: !

Samidare: And asides, Didn't you promised me (your one and only starter) that you'll... you'll... (stutters)

T: Okay, Okay. Say Samidare, Are we ready for Hard?

Samidare: ...

T: ...

Samidare: ...

T: ...

Samidare: No Admiral (in a deadpan voice).

T: What?!

Samidare: I'm sorry but our resources wouldn't hold a full-hard clear let alone our levels to escape Shiplocks.

T: (Sudden realization) Hmm, I understand. Then order all expedition teams to go out and collect resources and order our Heavy cruisers ,Aviation cruisers, Hiryuu and Souryuu, Taihou, Nagato, Mutsu, Musashi, and few light carriers to sortie and go power levelling.

Sanidare: How about our Destroyer and Light cruiser teams?

T: send them to Ooi and let her power level too. Please Bring Italia and Roma there and level up post-haste.

Samidare: Yes!

T: I guess, we're going to be a bit busy the following weeks.

Samidare: Yes!

T: okay, let's go now.

T: (looks at the levels of his ships) Hmm, looks like we wouldn't make them reach our targets soon. Samidare, Let the others take rest and have them re-energize for our grind next day.

T: Samidare?

T: (realized she is not there) Ah, I forgot she is still on expedition.
