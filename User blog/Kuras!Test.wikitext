This post is created partly for personal use and partly to help others. Since I have to look up information, requirements and my previous fleet compositions every month for my monthly (EO) clears, I decided to place all that in one place. Thus this post was born! However, feel free to use this as well!
<br>
The information written below is based on personal experience and knowledge combined with information available from online sources.
<br>
My compositions are not necessarily the most effective (for you). Don't hold me accountable for any loss of your resources by following me!
<br>
Furthermore, if your HQ level differs from mine, you may encounter different enemies/enemy patterns than I do. My HQ level is 120.
<br>
Lastly, if you happen to have questions, comments, and/or critique related to this post, feel free to leave a comment.

Have fun, good luck, and happy sailing! ^___^

Please keep in mind that my compositions and setups are not necessarily recommended.

Since results are heavily dependent on multiple variables, your mileage may vary.
