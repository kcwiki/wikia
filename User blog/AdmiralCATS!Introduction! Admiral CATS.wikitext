Hi, I am CATS.

I started playing KanColle in January 2014 and after a casual start I became addicted and have been playing every day for over a year now.

I learned about the game from Shimakaze pictures posted on Facebook and my initial goal was just to get her in the game as well, which didn't take long. While I learned to love a lot of the other shipgirls as well, she is still my #1 shipwaifu and highest level kanmusu.

This is my first attempt at writing a blog, something I wanted to do for a while now, but never got around to actually do. (and my skills at editing texts, pictures etc. is rather low)

My plan is to write blogs about technical stuff in the game, like how to clear event maps or extra maps, how to effectively complete daily/weekly/monthly quests and do stuff like farming ressources, doing expeditions and sparkle ships in an effective way. Well, at least if I find the time to do it, as I have a daytime job, a family with 2 kids and all those kanmusu competing for my attention. I am already happy if I get more than 5 hours of sleep.
==My accomplshements in the game so far:==
*collect all shipgirls
*cleared all events since I started the game
*placed top 20 in ranking (and top 500 several times)

==long term goals:==
*continue to collect all new shipgirls and clearing all events
*marrying one of every kanmusu
*maxing the luck of several shipgirls (Shimakaze, Kitakami and submarines for a start)

I never was this well prepared for an event, so my hopes are high that I will be able to clear it as well. (On hard mode all the way of course)

And with that I say goodbye for today.
