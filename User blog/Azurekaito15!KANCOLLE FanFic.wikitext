hmmm test stuff
===Factory===
===transport ship contruction===
Construction of transport convoy consume strategic points, also increasing the resource (fuel,steel,etc) will allowed more transport ship to be contruct example: 900/100/900/100 + 50 strategic points will get you about 4-5 transport ships(it's still RNG base)


====Abyssal Counterattack====
When abyssals finish preparing their counterattack force, they'll start counterattack operations in order to take back sea area. After players renew a turn and after enemy's turn is completed, some sea area's hexagon in the strategy interface will change to a yellow/orange/red color to signify that enemies are preparing counterattack on the sea area. If players failed to intercept these counterattacks, the sea area will return to enemy control. In this case, players' transport convoys will also be destroyed and the guarding fleet will retreat to the player's naval headquarters.You can return the change area back by clearing the map on the area example: on your starting map clear any one of the map 1-1 to 1-4 will repel the abyssal. You can also put a fleet on that area and let it counterattack automatically.

If the area turn red and you have not repel/put a fleet there, the enemy will captured that area on the next turn, meaning you have to clear the area again and especially area that require other area to be clear to open, you'll have to clear the previous boss map to unlocks that area again.

'''Failing to defend your own naval headquarters from abyssal counterattacks will result in a game over.'''
