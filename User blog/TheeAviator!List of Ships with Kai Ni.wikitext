=='''Short Intro'''==
I made a list of all the ships in the game with a second remodel (Kai Ni) as well as blueprint ships. I'm putting it on here incase it's of any use to anyone. I'll try keep it up to date, let me know if there is anything you want to me change (e.g: more info on ships, pictures, etc). Enjoy.Â 

[DISCLAIMER: I'm not currently active on the game so forgive me if this list is outdated]

'''(There are currently 56 ships that have a second remodel and 5 Blueprint ships)'''
