'''提督との絆 / teitoku to no kizuna / Our Bond with the Admiral'''

 English

 (''Kongou'')
 Sleeping on the seabed
 From this deep sadness and the memories of time
 And in the midst of the light of the waking morning
 I dream of you

 (''Hiei'')
 You watch my back as
 I begin to float to the now calm sea of tomorrow
 This map (course) of the future you gave me
 I'll make sure it comes true

 (''Kongou/Hiei/Haruna/Kirishima'')
 This strait that drowns steel
 And these battles that cleave through the darkness
 And even the sadness of becoming alone
 I can overcome them 

 (''Hiei/Kirishima'')
 The winds of a blue time
 And your gentle smile
 I will always hold them close
 And head towards tomorrow (hope)

 (''Kongou/Haruna'')
 I can respond at this time
 To that gaze of yours
 Even the billowing smoke and this pain
 Yes
 They are my bond with you

 (''Haruna'')
 The end  of the sky beyond the horizon
 I can hear the rippling of a far away sea
 I fondly look back
 On the days you gave me

 (''Kongou/Hiei/Haruna/Kirishima'')
 The cold of sinking into the darkness
 And the sadness of of being left behind
 And even the loneliness of watching the end
 I will weave them together

 (''Kirishima'')
 The infernos of a crimson red time
 If I’m with you then I won’t be scared
 These feelings echo through my heart
 And I head towards tomorrow (the future)

 (''Kongou'')
 I will protect you
 I won’t leave you alone
 Even the billowing smoke and this pain
 They make this dress of mine

 (''Everyone/Hiei'')
 The winds of a blue time
 And your gentle smile
 I will always hold them close
 And head towards tomorrow (hope)

 (''Everyone'')
 I am sure I can respond at this time
 To that gaze of yours
 I believe in you
 So could you always please

 (''Haruna'')
 Hold this hand of mine


 Japanese

 海の底に眠る
 深い哀しみと時の記憶から
 目覚めた朝の光の中
 提督の夢を見る

 凪いだ明日の海に
 漕ぎ出す私の背中見つめている
 提督がくれた未来の航路
 大事に確かめる

 鉄の沈む海峡も
 闇を切り裂く戦いも
 一人になったさみしささえ
 超えてゆけるから

 青い時の風と
 提督の優しい微笑み
 いつでも心に抱いて
 希望へ駆けていくの

 提督の眼差しに
 私はこの時代で応える
 硝煙もこの痛みさえ
 そう
 提督との絆 

 空の果ての彼方
 遠い海の漣聞こえている
 提督がくれた私の日々
 大事に思い出す

 闇に沈む冷たさも
 取り残される切なさも
 終わりを看取る哀しみさえ
 紡いでゆけるから

 紅い時の炎
 提督となら怖くはない
 想いを心に響かせて
 未来へ駆けていくの

 私が護り抜くよ
 提督を独りにはしない
 硝煙もこの痛みさえ
 私のドレス

 青い時の風と
 提督の優しい微笑み
 いつでも心に抱いて
 希望へ駆けていくの

 提督の眼差しに
 きっとこの時代で応える
 信じてる
 ねえ　いつまでも

 手を握っていて


General Notes: 

- Plenty of interpretation in this, the main offender being that I never used 'our'. The song never uses 'our' but it does use 'my' so I translated these lyrics with one person in mind rather than 4 separate people, even though at some points they do refer to their own circumstances; such as when Kongou refers to 'this strait', having sunk along the Formosa Strait or the Taiwan Strait.

- The song lyrics make use of the technique where you write something and read it a completely different way. When this happens the way it is sung is first and the way it is written is in brackets.

- Pretty much every single time 'you' is said it is written 'Admiral' in the lyrics, I just got lazy and didn't try and fit 'Admiral' after everything.
