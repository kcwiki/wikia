I did it. I now have my first Kai Ni Mutsuki Class. I will now be working on Ashigara and Fubuki, as I feel that both will be integral to my success in the upcoming event. This is based off my reliance on heavy cruisers, and the fact that I needed more high level destroyers who I can rely on to take out air targets. I now can focus both of those things. I also plan on remodelling my two Akizuki class destroyers soon, so that AA-DD role can be filled completely. During this process, I Kai'd Naka and Zara, and Naka is on her way to being Kai Ni'd. Fusou is also level 74, so I plan on levling her passively by putting her on with the other ships I need to level. All in all, good prgress has been made.Â
