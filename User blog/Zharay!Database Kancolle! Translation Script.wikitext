Heyo everyone, today I bring to you a userscript for Firefox and Chrome (and possibly Opera and whatever else can use userscripts). It translates nearly all text found on [http://kancolle-db.tk/ Database Kancolle!] to English using the info found on this wiki.

Go check out the GitHub page found below. Its under GPL so anyone is free to view and edit the source code. This way if I ever disappear, the comunity can continue development on it.
