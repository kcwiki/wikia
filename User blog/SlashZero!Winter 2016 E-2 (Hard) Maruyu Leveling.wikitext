===What===
The first two nodes of E-2 cannot damage submarines.  The first node is sub-only, and therefore consumes 0 ammo.  The second battle is an airstrike, which gives ranking based on damage taken, with no damage taken resulting in S rank.  This allows:
*Positive morale gain for submarines over two battles
*50% win rate
*Average usage of 2.5 bars of fuel and 2 bars of ammo (for Maruyu) per sortie.  Other submarines will use 0.5 bars of ammo per sortie
*Around 700-1000 exp gained per run
*No chance of taking damage, unlike 5-3 grinding
===How===
#Make a fleet of a solo submarine
#Deploy to E-2 on the hard(甲) difficulty
#Retreat after the second node
#Don't resupply
#Repeat 4 times
#Resupply
Repeat as many times as you like for exp.

For sparkling, three runs should give 85 morale, assuming a start at 49.  However, you can't save the 2 bar of fuel from starting on 1 bar.
===Pro Tips===
*The first node gives you the option to night battle.  The second doesn't.
*If you have voices on you'll hear the MVP line after the second node battle.
*You can complete the first two daily sorties as well as the 10 sortie wins daily at the second node.
*You can YOLO into the following battle for 525 more exp and certain taiha if you're going to remodel anyways, or want repairs for the daily.
