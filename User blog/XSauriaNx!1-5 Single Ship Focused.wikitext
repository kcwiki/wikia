<p style="margin-bottom:1em;color:rgb(0,0,0);">I personnally have a way of leveling a single ship either it could be a Destroyer, a Light Cruiser, or a Light Aircraft Carrier. You only need two ships on this 'cause we're focusing on leveling one ship at a time. There are little bit of drawbacks that I've observed but I personnally don't mind. I only use this way of leveling of leveling ships when I want them to get level 50.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">So here's how I do it:</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">'''What you need:'''</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">The ship you want to level up. (Either a DD, CL, CVL)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">'''Where would you do this:Â '''</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">only on 1-5 (you only need node A to spam)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">'''Composition:'''</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">Set the desired ship to level as the Flagship then add the Submarine. (remove the equipments of the submarine)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">'''How to do it:'''</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">Spam node A until you're tired of it.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">
</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">'''Pros:'''</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">Less resource getting burned. (So far, each sortie I do cost more or less 10 for each resource)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">Decent experience points. (540xp is quite good in my opinion)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">Can be a good way to have your ship sparkling good. (I'm still testing this since I already have some ship getting sparkled easily)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">'''Cons:'''</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">HQ experience points. (1-5 is known to increase your HQ level fast for low level TTKs. But as I noticed, I only get 75xp per sortie.)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">There are more cons that needs to be verified. I still need to go on more test runs for this leveling trick. Feel free to add something about this or say more about the drawbacks on using this way to level ships.</p>
