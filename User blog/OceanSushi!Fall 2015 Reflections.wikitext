<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;margin-top:0px!important;"><u>Introduction</u></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;margin-top:0px!important;">I realised I had too many things to say about my Fall 2015 Event experience so I decided to make a blog post. It was a tedious, sanity-draining experience due to the sheer amount of FarmColle, but it was pretty rewarding compared to Summer 2015.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;margin-top:0px!important;">This TTK Event Trait Wheel Model was taken from this thread started by Lici Ui: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:373477</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;margin-top:0px!important;"><u>Aim</u></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;margin-top:0px!important;">My main aim was to get Akizuki and Prinz. As a newer admiral I lost out on the chance to get them in Fall 2014. Then, when I discovered the voice clips for Hagikaze and Graf, I immediately went: "OMG HAYAMI SAORI SHIPS, I MUST GET THEM CUZ THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE". My priority was Prinz > Akizuki > Hagikaze > Graf, but since Akizuki was on an earlier map i farmed for her first.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">I had also aimed to get my very first A class medal, but real life commitments (aka exams) restricted the time I had available to play.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;"><u>Inner traits:</u></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Management-  I had no problems with fleet locking mainly because I have an army of DDs, and the event focused a lot on DDs. My bucket count was just right, while I had a surplus of resources to use for farming.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Judgement- Farmed Akizuki on Easy mode first to save resources, and then proceeded to farm Prinz on Easy mode too. I wanted Hagikaze badly and I was afraid of being unable to clear the event due to exams, so after getting Prinz I just cleared E4 on easy and E5 on medium.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Sanity- Nearly went insane so many times from farming, at least I didn't sink any girls or damage stuff in real life. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;"><u>Outer traits:</u></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Set Up- After the trauma from Summer 2015 I swore to build up my fleet to prevent myself from getting killed by ship-locking. Went to train up many more CAs, BBs and CVs to lv 70+. Also, I started on equipment modernisation after I got Akashi, with the help of advice from the nice guys at the Fleet Preparation Board. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Resources- Started with 133k fuel, 111k ammo, 150k steel, 85k bauxite and 1000 buckets, which were supposedly more than enough for farming and event map completion.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Time- Student by day, TTK by evening & night. Didn't have a lot of time to play, but it turned out to be sufficient.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Intelligence- Kept checking the KC wiki Fall event page to update myself on branching rules and other tips. I waited till the 2nd or 3rd day of the event before actually starting on the event. Also read up a lot on combat & equipment theory.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Skill- Nothing much to say here since I was just following standard equipment and fleet set-ups borrowed from others. Tweaked my equipment and fleet setup along the way to improve my chances of S ranking a node.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Experience- My 2nd event so I still can't consider myself as an experienced player. I did a lot of research on the game though.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Luck- Not very good. Took 100+ runs for Akizuki and 95 runs for Prinz. Though, I took less runs for Graf (45) and got a 2nd Akashi from E3. Got Arashi on E5 last dance too. Nothing to say about event map clearing runs, probably average luck.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Attitude- No matter how long it took, I still kept farming, believing th<span style="font-weight:normal;">at my desired drop will appear eventually. There were some times that I felt like giving up but I persevered. </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">I just told myself to keep at it because who knows when will be the next time Akizuki and Prinz will be made available.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Support- The Kancolle wiki community has a lot of helpful people giving advice and updating the event pages wherever possible, so I would say the sup<span style="font-weight:normal;">port here </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">is pretty good.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;"><u><span style="font-weight:normal;">Ending Comments</span></u></p>
<p style="font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1em;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">I think I performed best in management, intelligence, judgement, resources and set-up. I performed the most poorly in sanity. Support, luck and time are ou<span style="font-weight:normal;">t of my control so no comments. Next time I'll take breaks from Kancolle whenever I feel burnt out from farming, and stop getting stressed so easily. </span></p>
