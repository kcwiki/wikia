2 [[Hayashimo]] in a row from boss.
WG42 hasn't proven itself on the boss for me, twice it hit her during the day for 4 and 36 dmg. Once in night battle for combined 40ish.

Hate this map. Most boss fights boss was targeted during the day with whopping 40dmg DA leaving nearly half the enemy fleet for night battles.
Support expedition on final kill.

51cm's because there is no such thing as too much Firepower. In the end Yamasushi were the most expensive paperweights ever. Musashi finished of a 13 hp cruiser and missed 2nd round, Yamato missed 1st round and got oneshot by the CV Hime. Repairs were expensive... Back to the basement with them.
Support expedition did wonderful destroying the DD and getting the cruiser to 13hp.
Nagato being the most noteworthy drop, overall terrible drops this event. Now to farm [[Roma]] and [[Takanami]]...
