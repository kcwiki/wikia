==1st part==
All three E-5 video in a single post ! The most important part of E5 is running the southern route... in order to avoid the night battle node ! I suspect VERY HIGH LOS will lead you to northern route more often... so i removed some seaplanes and managed to run southern route in all but 2 sorties, which made the E5 much less painful...<br />
P.S. Finally Makigumo come to shine ! Makigumo, you are the best !<br />She can't tow a carrier but somehow retrieved Akashi<br />

==2nd part==
Here is the updated E-5 guide, the previous one works but this one is better.
First fleet : 4CV2BB, Second fleet : 1CL 4DD 1CA (i think 1CL 5DD will work too)
Many branching rules are still unclear but we confirm that with 4DD in 2nd fleet you will never enter node D (unless you have sub) and maybe, more chance for southern route ?
Without enough LOS or wrong combination the compass will always send you to ACF route, but in some rare case you still have chance run into node F with correct setup...

And talk about E-5 training, the first submarine node cost no ammo, which is excellent for destroyer training, the downside is its base exp is slightly lower than 3-2-A (300 only compare to 3-2 310) and you cannot train ship for E-6 (MI lock)
Also the japs found a way to use sub for easier grinding, they claim that second fleet flagship cannot be sunk (i didn't test it anyway, you take the risk) and no force retreat penalty, so you can place a sub as second fleet flagship and tank lots of damage ... don't forget to add seaplane for the submarine carrier. (And again it is not confirmed that 2nd fleet flagship will not sink so if something bad happens don't blame anyone)
