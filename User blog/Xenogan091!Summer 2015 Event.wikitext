==E-1 : Prepare for Second Operation SN!==
[hard] 

Originally I planned to do the first two maps on medium and the rest on easy, but I cleared in on hard anyway. 

Without Kikuzuki, the map was kind of hard but with Kikuzuki it was a breeze, sort of. Nothing much notable except Ooyodo, Nowaki and Yuubari drops, but I already have three of them. 

Final fleet:
*Kikuzuki Kai [26]
*Yasen! Kai Ni [71]
*Ayanami Kai Ni [70]
*Nagato Kai [66]
*Hiei Kai [62]
*KTKM Kai Ni [68]
==E-2 : Combined Fleet, To The Solomon Islands!==
[medium] rest are easy, by the way :>

Was okay..? 

Main fleet:
*Kako Kai Ni 
*Nagato Kai
*Haguro Kai Ni
*Kongou Kai Ni
*Zuihou Kai
*Junyou Kai
Escort Fleet: 
*Shigure Kai Ni
*Haruna Kai Ni
*KTKM Kai Ni
*Poi Kai Ni
*Yasen Kai Ni
*Kiso Kai Ni
Kawakaze seems pretty cool, so I guess I'll keep her. 
==E-3 : Clash! The Second South Pacific Battle!==
Main fleet:
*Zuikaku Kai
*Nagato Kai
*Kaga Kai
*Kongou Kai Ni
*Zuihou Kai
*Junyou Kai
Escort Fleet: 
*Bucky Kai Ni
*Haruna Kai Ni
*KTKM Kai Ni
*Poi Kai Ni
*Yasen Kai Ni
*Ayanami Kai Ni
==E-4: Into the Strait! Destroy the Enemy Air Field !==
*Shigure Kai Ni
*<span style="line-height:21px;">Haruna Kai Ni</span>
*<span style="line-height:21px;">Yuudachi Kai Ni</span>
*<span style="line-height:21px;">Haguro Kai Ni</span>
*<span style="line-height:21px;">Kongou Kai Ni</span>
*<span style="line-height:21px;">Kaga Kai</span>
Tough because I had exams through this. Stuck until they announced the extension, y'know, exams.

Grinded this map after I completed E-5, so notable drops:

Akashi, Hayashimo, Akigumo, 2 Maikazes

Where are Kiyoshimo and Umikaze ;-;
==E-5 : Hard Fight! Western Deployment Fleet!==
Real easy, actually. I cleared it on impulse.
*Yukikaze Kai
*Kongou Kai Ni
*Haruna Kai Ni
*KTKM Kai Ni
*Zuikaku Kai Ni
*Kaga Kai
Libeccio..? Not a huge fan, but hey, I'll just keep her for a bit. To be real honest, she's the one that I've looked forward to the least.

IN THE END, I didn't complete much, or get Teruzuki, or get Kiyoshimo, or get Umikaze, or... well, I guess I'll look forward to the next event, and train until I can clear the next event !
