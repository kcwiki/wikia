'''''[!]''' This guide aims to help new/experienced players to combat limitation faced such as the number of ships-lots, ship-locking and stuff related. It may repeat what most guide said but solely focus heavily on ways to micromanage your fleet for the maximum effect with a minimum force required. This guide is subject to change at anytime should there be any false information and better methods.''



=='''Introduction: Understanding the true meaning of Play To Win'''==
Before i talk about what is 'Play to Win', Ask yourself this question:'what do we consider a win? Getting A-class medal? Collect all shipgirls and marry them all? Since there are no clear goals in the game, it is all up to you to decide but i strongly recommend you to at least train up a decent fighting force before advancing further.

Now back to the point, what is the true definition of Play to Win? To me, it literally means to beat the game without having the need to rely on shop items that require real $$$. You can still get A-Class Medal as long as you have the good fleet with proper equipment, resource, buckets to run the entire operation and the patient to clear. That includes intelligent strategy when it comes to Major Event which all will be talked later. However, there is always an option to use real money to help you get away from the limitation as shown below:

'''A comparison between a default account and account with payment.'''

|}
As you can probably see, using real cash will bring lots of benefits for yourself and also support developers. Players such as myself will have to face a great challenge when it comes to events and doing quest. Whether you are willing to sacrifice your wallet or not, all these limitations can be reduced to a certain extent. to make things fair, i've made a Q&A section to answer most of your question:



=='''[Q]: How do i get more resource other than expedition?'''==
Most Common Answers: Orel Cruising!

Yes, you can most likely do that if you have 3 or all 4 common submarines in your fleet. The alternate way is to stay under the softcap limit(Softcapping), the limit can be found in your fleet report. If you are asking why should we choose softcapping, just get prepared to do some calculation. In each day, you will receive a standard amount of 1440 fuel, 1440 ammunition, 1440 iron and 480 bauxite until the softcap limits have been reached. This is very useful for hardcore or active players in a long run. 

This method is suitable if you are doing sortieing, crafting, construction/LSC or event farming. If you still don't know what i mean, just take a look at the table below:
{| border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="article-table" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;"
|-
! scope="col"|Expedition (X) + Regen under Softcap
! scope="col"| Expedition (X) over Softcap
! scope="col" style="text-align:center;"|Period
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|X + 1.44k Worth of Resources
| style="text-align:center;"|X 
| style="text-align:center;"|1 day
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|7X + 10.08k Worth of Resources
| style="text-align:center;"|7X
| style="text-align:center;"|1 week
|}
Now imagine yourself with these extra''' 10.08k worth or resource''', just what you can do with these amount of resource? Don't feel afraid to use as many resources, as long as the events are not a month away or two. All except for bucket counts.



=='''[Q]: How to save more ship slots? '''==
Most Common Answers: <strike>Scrap</strike> Decommission them?

Decommission is one of the method but never foolishly scrap away the wrong shipgirl. One should note that you should never judge a shipgirl's look by her physical appearance. Common shipgirl such as Fubuki, can be remodelled to a powerful AA specialist. At the very least (for both type of players), you should have most of the shipgirls below:

'''''Disclaimer''': The shiplist provided below are what i believe to be considered a good fleet. It consist of shipgirls that are constructable (including LSC) that have more than average statistics. I am fully aware that it may contain information from what most guide said but it was made to be existed here for a reason: '''A checklist''' so you do not need to look for information all over the place. If you want details of each shipgirl, you can just click the CG card and it will direct you to their respective library page. If you want a full detailed comparison, just head to the bottom where the reference list are. ''



===='''[ Destroyers (DD) ]'''====

​DD are the backbone of your elite fighting force, you will need a couple of them to fully assemble a combined fleet or to send them into a transport map. You should have at least some DDs specialised in each of these different areas but not too many to save some ship-slots for rare and useful shipgirl. There is no exact number of DD you should have but about 20? of them or close enough should be sufficient for any major event.

===='''[ Light Cruisers (CL) ]'''====

Again, just like the DD, CL shares the same fate as the DD except that you need not have many of them. You will need at least one CL per event lock. In theory, you will need about 3 but a few more will save you from shiplocking restrain. At least get all three Sendai class remodelled especially Sendai, her equipment is more important than any CL other than Abukuma.

===='''[ Tropedo Cruisers (CLT) ] '''====

CLT are so OP that the game developers have put a limitation on how many you can assemble in a combined fleet. No matter, having 3 CLT k2 in your fleet will help you to a great extent. Not to mention that they do come with 61cm (Oxy) Quintuple Torpedo each, which can be improved on later games. You will definitely use them often for one of your shipgirl specialised in torpedo cut-in.

===='''[ Heavy Cruisers (CA) ]'''====

CA are commonly ignored by many newbies including myself earlier on. Some said that 4 CA are the very least you needed but will risk sacrificing someone for ship-locking. The Myoukou class, Maya and Choukai CA are the best CA you must have if you want pure quality. You can always add in more CA if you have the room for them, this ensures that

===='''[ Aviation Cruisers (CAV) ]'''====

Same as the CA, you still need to have a couple of CAV for the sake of shiprouting/shiplocking or simply to get extra things like LoS, AA, hunting subs etc (which can't be done by a CA). You should at least have a couple of Mogami class before remodelling the Tone class to k2. Tone class cruisers can be a good substitute early on for CA if you need to save the good CA for hard maps.

===='''[ Fast Battleships (FBB) ]'''====

I do believe that i need not explain much about the FBB since most people use them frequently. Do pay special attention to Haruna, she has a high statistic for luck and is useful for utilising night combat equipment especially in escort fleet. As for those who has Z1, please try to construct Bismarck later on if you have the resource to do it.

===='''[ Battleships (BB) ]'''====

At the very least, you should have Nagato and Mutsu if you are attempting all out Normal+. They perform much better than the FBB when it comes to tanking damage while exchanging shells. They can be constructed with normal recipe unlike LSC so try to construct them before others. Constructing Yamato and Musashi helps alot but should only be attempted if you are confident about your fleet strength and resource.

===='''[ Aviation Battleships (BBV) ]'''====

BBV shares a similar capability with CAV except that it is a battleship. Having all 4 BBV listed below is fine but some says that you just need the Fusou class. Fusou class battleships are have better statistics than Ise class with rare guns. Eitherway, they are not entirely bad but are useful for ship-locking.

===='''[ Light Aircraft Carriers (CVL) ]'''====

CVL are useful for replacing CV when countering shiplock or to act as a substitute for support expedition if you don't have enough extra CV. Speaking of how useful these CVL are, they are used for power-levelling despite morale penalty. I strongly recommend having all 6 of the following:

For CV(B), you will need every CV available and have their quest done ASAP especially to get Shoukaku and Zuikaku k2A. You can't deny the importance of how useful they are when they can still launch planes in Chuuha state, not to mention that their planes are great too if you don't have any special plane squadrons early on. Taihou is an exception should only be constructed if you have the resource.

=='''[Q]: What sort of equipment should i aim to at least have?'''==
There goes without saying that a fleet cannot fight without proper equipment. If you lack quality equipment, your fleet will have to fight the hardest against difficult enemies. The same could be said for quantity itself, you want ample equipment for all situation. You should also be very familiar that a small difference in equipment statistic make a huge difference such like fighters.

'''[ Main Armaments ] '''

If most of the shipgirl in your fleet are present from the shiplist above, you should be fine with the majority of the rare or advanced equipment. Yet rare weapon alone doesn't win battles all the time, you will still need to develop some basic equipment before you can improve/acquire rare equipment from quests and events. We begin with your main armaments first:

'''[ ASW ] '''

ASW are becoming part of the essential equipment to combat against submarines only maps. Fortunately, they are quite easy to obtain from spamming cheap recipe with a slight chance of acquiring Type 3 ASW variants equipment. About 12~13 Sonars is required to fit 1CL & 5DD with 2 sonars each. (3 for CL with 4 slots) The rest of the empty slot is where the Depth Charge goes. Also if you have Akitsu Maru, her ASW aircrafts are nice enough for your BBV and CVL.

'''[ Aircrafts ] '''

There are now a whole lot more aircraft as compared to a few years ago, they now play a crucial role when it comes to securing air superiority and bombarding enemy fleets. Since playing Normal+ is much more difficult to achieve absolute air superiority, you should be taking the effort to acquire any special squadrons from quest or planes from other nation to build up your air power. Therefore it requires you to have more than enough planes to run a carrier task force + LBAS + 2 support expedition.

=='''[Q]: How can i save time & buckets on repair?'''==
Answer: Akashi
<br>{{ShipBattleCardKai|Akashi/}}

If you love to save those precious buckets and want to heal up your fleet a little for better survivability, then Akashi is the right shipgirl for you. For the maximum effect, i strongly encourage players to get 4 Repair Facility for the 5 mini repair docks. Getting rid of her for the first time is heartbreaking, however all is worth when she returns as a fully functional mini repair docks with 4 Repair Facility.

You can read more about her here: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Akashi#Anchorage_Repair_.28.E6.B3.8A.E5.9C.B0.E4.BF.AE.E7.90.86.29



=='''[Q]: How can i save more equipment slots?'''==
Answer: Its Akashi again...
<br>{{ShipBattleCardKai|Akashi/}}

Again, Akashi had demonstrated herself to be the most useful shipgirl when it comes to supporting both players and the entire fleet. Her second ability is the ability to convert trash equipment into a useful tool, or to upgrade it into a new equipment next tier. She can only do that if you have the required shipgirl assisting. Thus having most of the required shipgirls will allow you to upgrade most of the equipment as well. 

Resource and Screws are heavily needed however, you'll hunt screws from quest and send expedition for resources. 'What equipment should i improve?' you may asked, most people will definitely say 'improve all common equipment you use often'. To be more specific, improve what is not deemed obsolete by others and useful.

{| border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="article-table" style="height: 100px; width: 700px;"

| style="text-align:center;"|Type 91 AP >>> +6~MAX
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|Torpedo
| style="text-align:center;"|61cm (Oxy) Quint >>> +6
|}
The above table are just a common example of what most people believe is important to improve, Honestly, this just improve the easier one first such like as the AP shell or 35.6cm. However, you should probably [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Hayashi_H/Advanced_Equipment_Guide visit this fully detailed guide on equipment proceedure if you are lazy enough].(might be outdated due cuz improvable planes)

It is also ill-advised to upgrade a max level stick into a crappy level 1 staff. You should know by now that max level equipment has better statistic than an unimproved equipment a tier higher. Also, it is important to improve your all equipment slowly and not rush on just one equipment. You should only rush if you know you have excessive screws.



=='''[Q]: How do increase my winning chances?'''==
There is no guarantee way to win because your fate is under RNGesus's control. Even if you have the fleet with highest level and the best equipment equipped, there are chances where things don't go into your own favour. You will end up shouting and screaming why RNG hates you but it can't be helped. The only way you can do to increase the chance of success is by the following:

'''[ Sparkling ] '''

Most of you should know that sparkling is essential part of high performance and guarantee a shelling support from the support expedition. You should only sparkle a fleet/shipgirl when the situation is critical or you have no choice. One good example will be trying to clear an event map, it requires some luck when comes trying to survive the entire journey just to deplete the boss's health. Sparkling everyone including the support expedition takes hours and its a huge waste of time, i would rather choose a cost effective way than sending everyone in early on. For normal sortie, just sparkle if you think you need one.

How should you sparkle efficiently during events? You can choose to sparkle them individually in world 1-1 or choose to use Irako consumable. If you're lazy to sparkle individually, you can always choose Irako instead. Honestly i'm not a big fan of Irako but it may be helpful for the third fleet for support expedition only. Why? Support expedition will receive lesser morale drop when returned as compared to your fleet from a sortie. Also, the 4th fleet requires only the FS sparkled for 90% chance of triggering the support shelling. Therefore, only requires you to sparkle 7 shipgirls in total to almost fully trigger the shelling support. Btw, PVP is not an effective way.



'''[ Formation ] '''

Combat formation are simply one of the important factor for fleet survival. Pick any wrong formation and your fleet will be in chaos. i won't spell out the correct formation for what sort of enemy fleet but i would like to share some of the uncommon formation that you should know:

[ / ] Echelon Formation ~ Mainly used by submarines but you can actually use this formation to survive through night battle. RNG happens greatly at night but you will have more chance of evading than getting hit in double line.

[ + ] Diamond Formation ~ Good against the air but you can also use it to counter submarine simultaneously.



'''[ Fleet Command Facility (FCF) ] '''

Have you always get fed up with RNG constant trolling by rekting one of your shipgirl and forcing you to retreat everyone? Well there might be a solution to that! The fleet command facility is currently available to you if you can get Ooyodo from world 1-6 or from event drops. Once remodelled to Kai, she will have a fleet command facility made available for you almost immediately. To activate this product, you must first equip it on a FS of the first fleet in a combined fleet. Once a shipgril from either fleet gets taiha'ed, you can call a DD to escort her back to base safely while continue sortieing. However you should keep a look out for certain things:

1. If all DD in the escort fleet are heavily damaged, you should retreat immediately.
2. Avoid placing your DD as FS, you can't escort her back.
3. Escort fleet with less than 5 shipgirls cannot choose anti-air for the next node.

Despite all these, a FCF gives you a chance to reach the boss node safely and fight. It act as a springboard to propel your fleet forward without worrying anyone getting sunk next node. This is also useful for increasing consistency for reaching boss node, and deal some damage as compared to none when forced to retreat. 

Other than the FCF, Ooyodo has better statistic than Yuubari has. Good overall stats, excellent plane slots, and the best of all is having 4 slots. What more can you ask?


'''[ Plan decisively ] '''

Even though its a RNG and a strategy game, you should also plan decisively in real time. Before the start of an event, look out for developer's hint. Let's say the devs are hinting that the upcoming events are heavily focused on carriers, you should be prepared and check that you have enough equipment for everything they throw at you.

During an event, you should learn to collect intel from frontline players and formulate your plan on a writing platform. First read through the map, understand their ship-locking rule and the enemies you will be facing. Look out for any ship-routing as they can save you from going an extra node. Then decide who is best suited for clearing the map and who should stay behind from ship-locking. Check if your equipment are sufficient enough to meet the LoS requirements or to achieve AS+. 

Last but no least, look at the reward and decide if the map is worth going at a higher difficulty or lower. For casual players, i strongly recommend you to not to attempt Hard unless its doable and the reward are worth alot. Also, don't forget to farm on unless you have your reason for not doing so.



=='''[Q]: Who should i look out for in the event or extra operation?'''==
Most of the rare drops you will receive are rare DD, the first couple of time will bring smile in your face and give thanks for what RNGesus has offered. Their rare and advanced equipment are nice but soon those smile will fade away as you realised that she is not the girl of your type (unless you really love her). The most common ones are DD which will give you crappy radars and ASW equipment. Some of them comes with late model 12.7cm HA or 12.7cm Model B k2 which has better stats than will soon become obsolete when the 10cm HA+AAFD arrives. Below are a list of DD that you should look out for:

For Non-DD rare drops, you will feel a slight hope of getting better shipgirls. This is mostly true for non-Japanese shipgirl, they have rare equipment, great stats and nice CG. Therefore as soon as you acquire them from rare drops or reward, lock everything including the equipment and ask question later. You may take this opportunity to celebrate their return and give thanks to RNGesus. 



=='''[Q]: What kind of quest should i look out for?'''==

This should be easy, you should keep a look out for quest that have rare equipment, medals, screws, upgraded planes and 'unlocking' better shipgirl. Below are examples of what you might missed out from focusing too much on 'unlocking' Z1 and Shouakaku X Zuikaku K2A.
