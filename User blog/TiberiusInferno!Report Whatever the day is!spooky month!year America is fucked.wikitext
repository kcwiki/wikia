Well, lots of things have happened. For one, I Kai Ni'd Kirishima, Kawakaze, AND Jintsuu. I Kai'd Nimu and Libeccio (second one on the way), so now I have some good DD guns and another sub to feed to the Orel Sea.Â 

100k fuel. 65k ammo. 72k steel. 53k baux. 319 buckets. I am not ready for this. I'm also probably gonna be gone for an entire week during the event, assuming it starts around where ti did last year. FUCK. Anyways, 3 Kai Ni's and I don't know where to go next. Maybe I'll just clear the EO' s and go from there. I'll think about it.
