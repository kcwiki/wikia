After running a very few number of tests, it is my belief that 0 plane slots contribute to LoS checks despite being size 0.



Map test ran on: [[World 3|World 3-5]]

It's believed that you need effecitve LoS of around 28 to go from G to K.  Else you get kicked out at J.

Fleet comp: 1 CL + 4 or 5 DD

Ships: Yuubari lv46 (CL) // equipment: 3 type 0 observation seaplanes, 1 damecon

Nowaki lv36 (DD), Asagumo lv37 (DD), Kiyoshimo lv45 (DD), Hayashimo lv46 (DD), Harusame lv 46 (DD) // equipment: 1 main gun 2 damecons

Fleet effective LoS assuming 0 slot seaplanes don't give any LoS = 11 (KCV for some reason adds a point and it shows up as 12)

If we assume seaplanes in a 0 slot give 0 LoS, this fleet should easily fail the suggested 28 LoS requirement.

Result: two attempts, both resulted in successful LoS checks to the boss node.

On a third test I removed the 3 seaplanes and used yellow guns/damecons instead.  I was kicked out at node J.



Small sample size sure, but if my effective LoS was 11 vs. 28, it should be pretty clear that the check would fail.

If we assume the seaplanes did count, my effective LoS would be around 47 and would easily pass the check.



In conclusion:

So while having a 0 seaplane slot will kill your artillery spotting, out of combat it looks like the game doesn't care how many planes you have in your slots for LoS checks.

And if you wanted to run yuubari on 3-5 you can :3
