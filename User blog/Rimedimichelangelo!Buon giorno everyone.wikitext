Hi there,

I've been reading and posting anon comments since I've started playing (March 2015). I'm stationed at Lingga Anchorage with the username "rime", my HQ lvl is currently 71, and my favourite daughters are the four Kongou sisters, my baby Ryuujou, and my qtpies Yukikaze and Ayanami.

As a semi-beginner TTK, my strong point is accumulating too much Ammo, my weak point is definitely Fuel (damn you, fuel!!!!), and my bad habit is going on sorties without checking which quests I've got going.

The reason why I signed up now is because with my RL pace is slowing down, so I'm able to play extensively every day.
