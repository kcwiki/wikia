<span style="font-size:16px;">'''1.Composition<br />'''</span>B103 repuires [[Yura Kai Ni]] as flagship, along with at least 2 of the following ships: [[Murasame]] , [[Yuudachi]] , [[Harusame]] , [[Samidare]] , [[Akizuki]] , up to '''3 additional ships''' ([[Quest#One-time Quests|reference Quests page]] ).
So I chose 2DD as [[Yuudachi]] and [[Akizuki]] , and 3 additional ships as [[Haguro]] , [[Ashigara]] , and [[Taihou]] . (2CA+1 CVB).<br />

<p style="font-weight:normal;">I chose two ships out of five simply because the level was high, I think that there is not much difference among the five ships regarding this quest.Necessary is enough level(about 60+?).</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">2CAs because I fix the route of 5-1(Start to A, H to I(Boss)), I think that it is OK if 2CAVs. Since BB appears in both maps, chose a ship with sufficient firepower. However, since the boss is not strong enough to require night battle even at 5-1, if the level is sufficient, it does not mean that anyone has an advantage.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">1 CVB may be CV. Hiryuu Kai / souryuu Kai can also secure AS with 5-1-H node. But CVL may be difficult to survive on Pre-Boss.</p>

===2.Equipment===
In 5-1, [[Yura Kai Ni]] made equipment for OASW for 5-1-A and Boss fleet's sub. But [[kouhyouteki|Kouhyouteki]] may not be necessary because it is not so powerful.<br />in 2-3, is to DA. I think that there is no particular problem with this.

2DDs, also to with DA equipments. It's not necessary to AACI setup any ships because enemy's air power isn't so scary.

I think that 2 CAs are not troubled with DA. No need to CI.

CV (B), i<span style="font-weight:normal;">f</span><span style="font-weight:normal;">  it'</span>s a remodeled ship, you put [[Reppuu]] in 2 slots from fewer you can take AS at 5-1-H. 
===3.Result===
Luckily, I gained S-rank in one sortie. Before sorties, I thought 5-1 was a little difficult without BB, but I noticed enough CA in this map <span style="font-weight:normal;">when I finished</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span>.I thought that clearing this Quest is not too difficult even with a ship of a slightly lower level.
