==Introduction==
Coastal Defense ships have been proven to be able to replace Destroyers for special requirements (Transport Task force) or for branching rules (world 1-6) but the question of whether they can replace DD for expeditions has never been really answered.<br />
By looking around the comment section of the [[Expedition]] page, it has been stated that using 1DD 3DE allows to clear expedition 4,5 and 9 by ignoring the original requirements<ref>http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Expedition#comm-560986</ref> (see [[Expedition/Reference tables|reference tables]] for details on the requirements) but no proof for DD being interchangeable with DE for said expeditions has been found ( for exemple using 1CL 2DE 1SS for exp 5).<br />
So tests have been conducted on '''all''' expeditions requiring DD to have a look at which ones will still succeed even if DD are replaced by DE.
(read only the summary at the end of the page if you are lazy)

==Notes==
* All requirements aside from the number of Destroyers (DD), who were replaced by Coastal Defense Ships (DE) and Light cruisers (CL), for new meta, were respected.
* No overdrumming (carrying more {{EquipmentLink|Drum Canister (Transport Use)|text=Drum Canisters}} than required) or [[Morale/Fatigue|Sparkling]] were used in order to avoid any possible Great Success (not that it could change anything to the result).
* Note that 4 {{ShipLink|Etorofu|Shimushu|Kunashiri|Matsuwa|text=DEs|link=List of coastal defense ships by upgraded maximum stats}} are currently available in game.
==Summary of all the tests conducted on this page==
'''TL;DR'''
*DDs and DEs are interchangeable for expeditions 4,5 and 9 '''but''' cannot be mixed together.
**expedition 4 works with 1CL 2DD and with 1CL 2DE but will not work with 1CL 1DD 1DE.
**expedition 5 and 9 work with 1CL 2DD 1XX and with 1CL 2DE 1XX but will not work with 1CL 1DD 1DE 1XX.
*It is also possible to use a completely different setup than the original requirements: 1DD 3DE (DD doesn't need to be flagship) will work for exp 4, 5 and 9.
**If for exp 4 using a DD instead of a CL is preferable, it will be mandatory to bring an extra ship than the original requirements, since 1DD 2DE isn't a viable option.
**Also note that this setup is only available for admirals having 3DEs or more in their naval base.
*4DE do not work as a replacement to the original setups for exp 4,5 and 9.
