so, you want to play Kantai Collection because dem shipgirls?

Do you think it's easy?

no, it's hard as bricks. <u>fucking </u>bricks.

You said, the wikia is too big of a place for you to browse?

Too bad because you'll need to fucking read it at some point.

But fear not, as I once were a newface who got saved by kind hearts of Wikia contributers

I'll tell you where to start!

let's get used to the terminologies of Kantai Collection first.

'''Q: So why would I want to know about terminologies?'''

A: <strike>Because you wankers don't know how to read.</strike> You should be able to search all the damn thing on wikias if you know the 'words' you should put into searchbar

''Note: what I put in the " " brackets are words that you should use to search for full info''

so let's get started.
