==KanColle-Themed Cards Against Humanity Cards==
[http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/ Cards Against Humanity] is a simple card game consisting of black (question) and white (answer) cards.

[http://pretendyoure.xyz/zy/ Pretend You're Xyzzy] is an online version of Cards Against Humanity.

[http://www.cardcastgame.com/ Cardcast] is an open format card game in which you can create arbitrary card decks. It's possible to import these decks into Pretend You're Xyzzy.

The goal of this post is simply to compile a list of suggested black and white cards for a KanColle-themed Cards Against Humanity deck. Please post any suggestions you might have in the comments and I will add them to the list.
===UPDATE===
A Cardcast deck has been created and is available [http://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/FR99Z here].  Anyone can use it in Pretend You're Xyzzy as long as you have the code (FR99Z).  It should have all the latest cards...I'm not sure I will continue to update this list just because maintaining two lists is twice the work.  But please continue to give suggestions to add.

And yes I wrote "Cards Againts KanColle" 'cause I'm a friggin idiot...
