What a beautiful day! It's such a shame to waste it by doing all of these paper works. Well I guess it can wait, I should ask Yuudachi to get something to eat. I know how she likes the icecream at Mamiya's Cafe so maybe that's where we should head too. I am so lucky to have her with me at the base, I still remember when I first met her, she was such an energetic girl with the cute catchphrase Poi~ she always said. Yuudachi always tried her best, she loved it when I praised her. I don't know how I can battle without my favorite Destroyer, I'm glad she is there for me. The summer here is so beautiful, I usually enjoy the dawn at the dock with Yuudachi. That reminds me of the last Valentine's Day, she gave me this cute chocolate she made and it tasted really good. She is such a good girl, I always want to do something for her. I wanted to show Yuudachi how much I care for her! Maybe I will do it today, I will ask her. Yuudachi! Let's go to Mamiya's place. The sun is way up now, you shouldn't sleep that much! I want to ask you something too... Yuudachi. I always wanted to, but I couldn't. I couldn't do it yesterday. I won't be able to do it today also, and tomorrow... Yuudachi is not here anymore.
