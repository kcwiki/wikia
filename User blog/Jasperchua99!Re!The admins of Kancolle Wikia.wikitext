==Forewords==

This blog is a continuation of [[User_blog:Fujihita/The_admins_of_KanColle_English_Wikia|The admins of KanColle English Wikia]] as it pays tribute to the past, gives a brief history of KanColle English Wikia and provides information on the admins from Seventh Generation onwards

==Generations==
;The Sixth generation(Correction)
:Technically, [[User:Shinhwalee|Shinhwalee]] is suppose to be the only Sixth generation admin in [[User_blog:Fujihita/The_admins_of_KanColle_English_Wikia|The admins of KanColle English Wikia]] but due to miscommunication, [[User:Shinhwalee|Shinhwalee]] is officially the only Sixth generation admin while [[User:Zel-melon|Zel-melon]] and [[User:Chocolatecravinghobo|Chocolatecravinghobo]] are the new seventh generation Admins
;The Seventh generation
:This Generation oversees the transfer of the wiki bureaucrat from  [[User:CDRW|CDRW]] to [[User:がか|がか]]. and oversees the promotion of 3 admin and 2 content moderators
;Generation Eight
Due to internal setting set by Fandom, Eighth Generation Admins are introduced to counter issues set out by the Fandom Staff
