Surely everyone experienced it, the type of farming that you can't help but '''rush''' and '''use buckets everytime''' your important waifus are being damaged to midways. Plus when you are almost finished yet '''a ship has been damaged red''' and you '''can't proceed because you love them''' and '''you can't lose them''' just for the '''sake of finishing the boss node'''. '''OR''' '''WORSE''', '''LOSING RESOURCES'''.

Well shit the game is hard. But I just can't stop playing it. I really love it.
