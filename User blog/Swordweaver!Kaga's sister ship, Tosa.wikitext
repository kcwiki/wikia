Everyone makes a big deal about Shinano, and there's talk of Super Yamato-class Kii (which is more likely to be Yamato Kai2, since we've had planned upgrades, but no planned-only ships)

but there is at least one more large ship that fulfills conditions for kanmusu, if just barely.

Kaga-class Second ship, Tosa. Her hull was finished and launched, but the superstructure wasn't completed because of the Washington Treaty. She was fated to be a test hull, and thanks to her, the AP rounds, and torpedo bulges the other girls got were developed.

Here's how I think she might turn out to be as a kanmusu:

She'd have long dark brown hair, in low twintails that would reach her waist. Her outfit would probably be similar to Nagato-class (since she was an improvement on their design), but a little less revealing. She also would be a bit smaller-breasted (her displacement, with no superstructure or guns would be lower, right?)

Personality-wise, she's something of a combination between Kaga's slow, calm, curt speech pattern, Yamato's shyness, and Shirayuki's homebodyness. She's not familiar with her guns, and tends to missfire them with a sneeze.

I came up with lines, stats and base equips too, but rather than just list them here, I'll figure out how to make a kanmusu page, or something.
