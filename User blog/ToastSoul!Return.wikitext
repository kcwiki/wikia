Full version

 '''English'''

 I'd like to ask one day
 But I'm sure I wouldn't be able to
 Do you remember the first ocean we saw that day?

 It'd be nice if we could go together
 Sorry, maybe it's a bit far
 I won't forget the sunrise I watched with you

 On a stormy night we head off
 Carrying the weight of our things
 Forming a line, we still have to keep going
 But the rain is too strong to get back
 The pain is blinding

 Remember me, that I was here
 Even if my morning and your dreams sink and rot
 I will return
 Holding on to the wishes and prayers

 Don't forget the winds that we raced
 Even if the falling ocean and the exploding sky spill and fade away
 We will cross paths again
 This is my way back to you

 Like the season of the cherry blossoms
 I fell in love with your profile
 I won't forget your smile like the sunflowers

 As the petals fall we set out in the morning
 Carrying the final shield
 Forming a circle, we have to make it
 But the clouds hang low and hold us back
 My vision blurs

 Just wait for me―――

 The moon I looked up at and the spraying waves
 The snow and the rain is all so familiar 

 Time falls quietly, gathering deeper
 Even if your night and my footsteps are erased
 I will come back here
 So I embrace you

 I won't forget the clouds we chased
 The falling ocean and exploding sky fade into the distance
 Someday we'll walk side-by-side
 For bringing us together, you are my hope


 '''Japanese'''

 いつかは聞いてみたいな
 でも　きっとできないね
 あの日見た　初めの海　覚えてる？

 一緒に行ってみたいね
 ごめん　少し遠いかな
 君と見た　朝焼け空　忘れない

 嵐の日の夜　僕らは旅立つ
 重い荷物持ち
 隊列を組んで　まだ進まなきゃ
 だけど雨が強く帰れない
 痛みが眩しい

 覚えていて　ここに居たこと
 僕の朝　君の夢　沈み朽ちても
 必ず還るから
 願い　祈り　抱きしめて

 忘れないで　駆け抜けた風
 落ちる海　爆ぜる空　零れ消えても
 いつか　巡り出逢う
 繋ぐ君への　帰投

 桜の季節見たいな
 君の横顔　見惚れてた
 ひだまりの　その笑顔　忘れない

 花びら舞う朝　僕らも漕ぎ出す
 最後の楯持ち
 円陣を組んで　たどりつかなくちゃ
 だけど　空が低くて進めない　
 視界が滲んで

 待ってて―――

 見上げていた月　飛沫上げる波も
 雪も雨も　みんな懐かしい

 静かに深く　降り積もる時
 君の夜　僕の跡　消していっても
 ここに還るから
 僕は　君を　抱きしめる

 忘れないよ　追いかけた雲
 堕ちる海　爆ぜる空　遠く霞んで
 いつの日か　ともに歩む
 繋ぐ君こそ　希望


 '''Romaji'''

 itsuka wa kiite mitai na
 demo kitto dekinai ne
 ano hi mita hajime no umi oboeteru?

 issho ni itte mitai ne
 gomen sukoshi tōi kana
 kimi to mita asayake sora wasurenai

 arashi no hi no yoru
 bokura wa tabidatsu
 omoi nimotsu-mochi
 tairetsu o kunde mada susumanakya 
 dakedo ame ga tsuyoku kaerenai
 itami ga mabushii

 oboeteite koko ni ita koto
 boku no asa kimi no yume shizumi kuchitemo
 kanarazu kaeru kara
 negai inori dakishimete

 wasurenaide kakenuketa kaze
 ochiru umi hazeru sora kobore kietemo
 itsuka meguri deau
 tsunagu kimi e no kitō

 sakura no kisetsu mitai na
 kimi no yokogao mihoreteta
 hidamari no sono egao wasurenai

 hanabira mau asa bokura mo kogi dasu
 saigo no tate-mochi
 enjin o kunde tadoritsukanakucha
 dakedo sora ga hikukute susumenai
 shikai ga nijinde

 mattete―――

 miageteita tsuki shibuki ageru nami mo
 yuki mo ame mo minna natsukashī
 shizuka ni fukaku furitsumoru toki
 kimi no yoru boku no ato keshite ittemo
 koko ni kaeru kara
 boku wa kimi o dakishimeru

 wasurenai yo oikaketa kumo
 ochiru umi hazeru sora tooku kasunde
 itsu no hi ka tomo ni ayumu
 tsunagu kimi koso kibou



Notes:

''kikan'' translates to 'Return', with implications of soldiers returning from war or people returning from far away. I like the title 'The Road Home' because it kinda feels like it fits more than the direct translation.

A lot of it is definitely conversational, as if singing/talking to someone.

'I'd like to ask' - Could be 'I'd like to hear'.

'first ocean' - Slight implications of 'the ocean that started it all'

'the weight of our things' - Actually 'heavy baggage'. Could have literal (weapons, gear) or figurative (not-so-great feelings) meaning.

'Forming a line' - Line ahead formation.

'too strong to get back' - Specifially to get back home.

'Remember me, that I was here' - Slight implications of 'Remember that I once lived'?

'exploding sky' - Air battles. Dunno what 'falling ocean' is meant to bring forth, although there's really only one other option.

'This is my way back to you' - If you read it the same way that you read the last line, its 'My return to you who connects'

'I fell in love' - Somewhat stronger wording than the original Japanese.

'profile' - As in, the side of someone's face. I mean, I get that it means you're standing side-by-side, but really, the side of someone's face?

'a circle' - Diamond formation.

'make it' - As in, make it somewhere.

'Just wait for me' - 'I'M COMIN' HOME BABY WAIT FOR ME' kind of 'wait for me'. Not the kind where she's being left behind.

'so familiar' - Actually 'nostalgic'.

'Time falls quietly, gathering deeper' - [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Anime/Music/Lyrics#Fubuki Fubuki] throwbacks. Describes time as if it's snow, and just so happens to use similar wording in the process.

'my footsteps' - Kinda more like 'the path that I left behind'. If you stretch the meaning a bit, you can interpret it as 'my existence'.

yooooo i can't think of a half decent translation for that last line
