'''Please note, Quest is probably a time-limited and will be gone soon. Better do it now'''

'''Tl;Dr: Pick Shiun if you don't have it yet. If you have it, you can decide between OSU2 or Shiun (I'd still go for another Shiun).'''

Decision making is hard and I understand that. Therefore, I made this so that I can just throw it to people who wants to know why you should choose what but don't really understand the importance of the plane. So the third quest for New Year gave you this:

{{QuestList|
{{Quest
|ID = B91
|Title_JP = 時代が来たか！航空火力艦なお正月！
|Title_EN = Overflowing battleship spirit! Celebrate the New Year with large ships' massive guns!
|Requirements = Bring a fleet with a BBV as flagship, which consists of at least 2 BBV and 2 CAV.<br />S rank [[4-2|World 4-2]] boss node 3 times.
|Rewards_RSC = 0/ 0/ 2017/ 0
|Rewards_Items = 
[[File:Improvement Materials.png|30px|link=Akashi's_Improvement_Arsenal]] X 3 <br />
[[File:Furniture fairy.png|30px|link=Furniture]][[Furniture|Furniture Fairy]]<br />
<div style="text-align:left;">
Choose one of the following:
* {{EquipmentLink|Shiun|image=30px}} [[Shiun]]
* {{EquipmentLink|Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane|image=30px}} [[Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane|Ro.43]]
* {{EquipmentLink|OS2U|image=30px}} [[OS2U]]
</div>
|Note = Requires: [[Quests#B90|B90]]
}}
}}

Let's get the first one out of the way first: [[Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane|Ro.43]]. This one is '''craftable''', unlike the other two. Therefore, no reason to get it.

Now the question comes to, OS2U or Shiun:

Shiun has one thing that made it the "MUST GET" plane of this quest. Its Base LoS. For new players, beside 2-5, I doubt you guys faced any other map that is LoS intensive yet, but that's the thing. Shiun's 8 LoS will help you get that precious LoS you need for certain node or quests (e.g. Bm7).

But yes, If you somehow have Akashi, a Type 0 Obs, screws and planes to spare, you will obtain a Type 0 Obs +(x) that has better stat than Shiun itself. However, that is not the case if you don't have Akashi; Shiun will help you.

By this point you probably realize that I made you read a shitload of stuffs just to tell you that Shiun's LoS is higher. Have fun.
