This page is intended as a resource to supplement places like akashi-list, since it is not always clear which [[Saratoga]] can do which improvement. In particular, it makes it clear that fully remodeling Saratoga into a CVB as soon as possible is not necessarily the best plan. Hopefully the game will give [[Intrepid]] or [[Gambier Bay]] the ability to improve [[F4F-3]] and [[F4F-4]] soon and eliminate this roadblock.
