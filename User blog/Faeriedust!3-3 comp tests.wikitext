So someone tell me that if you put

CV+CVL+BB+BBV+DD+Akitsumaru with 3 slow and 3 fast, you get 100% chance to go boss (i.e. 100% I->G) on 3-3?

So I guess I shall test this.

Here is my comp:

Naka+Nagato+Fusou k2+Hiryuu+Ryuuhou+Yuudachi.

Run 1: A-E-F-G

Run 2: A-E-I-G

Run 3: A-E-I-G

Run 4: A-E-F-G

Run 5: A-E-F-G

Run 6: A-H-I-J (FAIL)

Run 7: A-E-F-G

Run 8: A-E-F-G

Run 9: A-H-I-J (FAIL)

Run 10: A-E-I (Flag rekt)

Run 11: A-E-I-K (FAIL)

Run 12: A-E-F-G

Run 13: A-H-I-G

Run 14: A-E-I-K (FAIL)

Run 15: A-E-F-G

Run 16: A-H-I-K (FAIL)

Run 17: A-E-F-G

Run 18: A-E-F-G

Run 19: A-E-F-G

Run 20: A-H-I-G

Run 21: A-H-I-J (FAIL)

Run 22: A-H-I-K (FAIL)

Run 23: A-E-I (Flag rekt)

Run 24: A-H-I-J (FAIL)

Run 25: A-H-I-J (FAIL)

Run 26: A-H-I-G

Run 27: A-E-F-G

Run 28: A-E-I-J (FAIL)

Run 29: A-E-F-G

Run 30: A-H-I (Flag rekt)

Run 31: A-H-I-G

Run 32: A-H-I-G

Run 33: A-H-I-K (FAIL)

Run 34: A-E-F-G

Run 35: A-E-I-K (FAIL)

Run 36: A-E (flag rekt)

Run 37: A-H-I-K

TOTALS:
*13x A-E-F-G
*5x A-H-I-G
*2x A-E-I-G
*1x A-E-I-J (FAIL)
*3x A-E-I-K (FAIL)
*4x A-H-I-K (FAIL)
*5x A-H-I-J (FAIL)
*2x A-E-I (Flag rekt)
*1x A-H-I (Flag rekt)
*1x A-E (Flag rekt)
So:
*20 win
*4x flag rekt
*12x FAIL

My conclusion: It's a pretty effective comp, and seems to go boss more than many. A-E-F-G path seems very common... o:
