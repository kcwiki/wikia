'''''[These are the events that took happened before the battles. Welp, I can choreograph the fights but I am too lazy to do that. Anyways, The event is easy and Clearing is a breeze. I could have cleared it in a day if played non-stop. Anyways, since I am finished and all...The bloopers ended faster than the thought itself.]'''''


==11/17/2015==

===Night before the update===

'''''Mess hall at the evening. The Admiral delivered a speech regarding to the next campaign'''''

'''Hiro''': Well then folks. Now that we are already okay and we are somehow managed to secure our supplies. Please let's make this happen. So, are you ready?

'''All''': We are ready!

'''Hiro''': Good. now then, eat up and have your fill. Tomorrow will be a dreaded day. Be prepared.

''The admiral finished his speech and went to his table where his two secretaries were waiting for him.''

'''Hiro''': Good work for today.

'''Sazanami''': Yes Master. Good work today.

'''Samidare''': Me too...

'''Hiro''': Say, are you ready to shine?

'''Sazanami''': Of course I am.

'''Samidare''': I'll do my best!

''Sendai suddenly approaches the Admiral.''

'''Sendai''': Now, You'll send me to the night battles Admiral. Please send me there.

'''Hiro''': I don't know yet. but for now, do your expedition duty.

'''Sendai''': Okay♫.

'''Jintsuu''': Ummm... Please don't spoil Sendai-nee sama for this.

'''Hiro''': Don't worry. I do plan on making her fight this time around. Unless the one I hated is also there.

'''Jintsuu''': I see. Well then, I'll go back.

'''Hiro''': Wait! I'll assign put you in our main operations if I might need your strenght. Please be our anchor.

'''Jintsuu''': Okay.

Jintsuu walked away and the three started eating their meal...

'''Hiro''': By the way, you are quite great when you cook together. I must say, you deliver the most surprising results.

'''Sazanami''': Of course, we put love on our ingredients.

'''Samdiare''': Yup.

'''Hiro''': ...

''The three silently eat and finished it in the few minutes after.''


==11/18/2015==

===Night of the update.===

'''Hiro''': Okay Samidare, we are not going there today.

'''Samidare''': Why are we not going there today?

'''Hiro''': I have no information on what to do, Plus if I met hard opponents, I might have to switch difficulties if I must; thus, reducing our chances of getting the ones we wanted.

'''Samidare''': I see...

'''Hiro''': By the way, Sazanami hasn't returned from exped yet.

'''Samidare''': Yup.

'''Hiro''': Well then. Let me sleep at you lap until the moment comes.

'''Samidare''': with pleasure.

''the Admiral laze around until Sazanami Arrives from expedition.''


===Exped teams [sendai]===

'''Sendai''': Hmm... I can't wait for the night battles. Yes!!! my time has come!

'''Arare''': Sendai-san, Please be quiet for now. we are kinda ringing our ears already and the drum canisters are a pain because they vibrate the sounds you make.

'''Senaid''': Sorry.

'''Arare''': I hope Onii- I mean the Admiral lets me sortie too...

'''Sendai''': Not happening, young destroyer. Asides, you can't do a cut in.

'''Arare''': Well. I can just throw these drums at the opponent, or do a drum cut-in.

'''Sendai''': You don't make some sense. Well, let's return home already.

'''Arare''': Yup. afterall, we are the only ones who are awake at the moment.

'''Sendai''': Yup.

''the two kept talking until they reached the base.''


===Exped Teams [Jintsuu]===

'''Jintsuu''': ...♫ (uuu... I am excited. Finally, the Admiral will make me sortie and will praise me for my great job. I can't wait)

'''Yayoi''': Jintsuu-san seems to be in the good mood today.

'''Uzuki''': Yup. By the way, did you hear that Jintsuu-san once to take the hand of the admiral because...

'''Jintsuu''': Wait... Where did you heard that and why do you share this story?

'''Mochizuki''': I heard it from Sazanami-san the other day...

'''Jintsuu''': really?

'''Mochizuki''': Not really. I heard the story itself from Naka-san. She said that the Admiral rarely makes a mistake, so to trick him; she and Sendai-san decided to change the label of the door. And poof! the two of you... (poker face)

'''Jintsuu''': Stop it..., Why can you say it with a face like that?

'''Mochizuki''': Because Yayoi taught me how to do that. (thumbs up)

'''Yayoi''': to be able to remain unfazed is my most noticable charm. (thumbs up)

'''Uzuki''': But you know. The Admiral has a hard time knowing how you think because of your poker face. I mean, how can we treat us better if he can't read your expression.

'''Yayoi''': AH! (realization)

'''Mutsuki''': Umm... how about we...

'''Yayoi''': I am a failure. I realized the fatal flaw of this expressionless face of mine. I can't make our beloved Admiral treat us more than princesses since he can't read my face... I am an idiot...

'''Mutsuki''': As I said...

'''Jintsuu''': Don't worry! I'll teach you how to smile.

'''Yayoi''': Really?

'''Jintsuu''': You can count on this onee-chan to do it!

'''Mutsuki''': But I am the...

'''Yayoi''': I am in your care.

'''Uzuki''': But to be our onee-chan... You must marry our Admiral. He is basically our Big brother.

'''Jintsuu''': (blushes) umm... It's a bit...

'''Mutsuki''': Uuuu...



Mutsuki went to Makigumo who was humming a song...

'''Makigumo''': ♫♫♫♫♫

'''Mutsuki''': Makigumo-chan... Why am I being ignored?

'''Makigumo''': well...

''Makigumo takes the paper that was attached on Mutsuki's back.''

'''''[Please don't listen to me!]'''''

'''Mutsuki''': Uuu...

'''Makigumo''': Kisaragi-san loves to tease you as always.

'''Mutsuki''': Waahh...

''the exped team reached the base in no time.''


===The Other expedition team.===

'''Sazanami''': Ah... For now, I have to bear the loneliness I feel when I am not with Master.

'''Hibiki''': Sazanami-san, I believe that you will see him soon. Asides, we are feel so blessed that Katori-san is also here along with Kawakaze-san and Maikaze-san who was a bit depressed because she was sent in the expedition team.

'''Abukuma''': How about me?

'''Hibiki''': My! the admiral made a blunder by putting a Kagerou class destroyer Abukuma in our fleet. Thus our resource collection will be hampered by...

'''Abukuma''': I am a light cruiser too!!!

'''Sazanami''': Well on paper, you are awesome, but since you can't equip seaplanes, all you can do is let others do the recon for you. Plus since you have meager torpedo status, even Kiso would laugh at your pitiful torpedo stat. Your saving grace was that you have this landing craft that make increases our resource gathering.

'''Abukuma''': Ow... you don't need to be that harsh.

'''Sazanami''': But, You can launch a surprise torpedo strike like a torpedo cruiser and I think you are great already. Please lead our way to victory Abumuma-sempai.

'''Abukuma''': Sempai...

'''Sazanami''': I take that back. I am your sempai afterall.

'''Abukuma''': Uuu...

'''Katori''': Wow.. she is sure a sharp tongued girl... Sazanami-san is.

'''Maikaze''': Well, she is like that but she really takes account the characters we had. by the way, she checks them because she wants to know if you are a threat or not.

'''Katori''': ... (It feels like I am being strangled by a unknown force.)

'''Kawakaze''': well, since she can only observe. All we have to do is steal a few points from her and we are good to go. there's no way we can fight her head on. unless Hibiki-san decided to help us.

'''Katori''': By the way; are you perhaps thinking that I like the Admiral, didn't you?

'''Kawakaze''': Aren't you?

'''Maikaze''': Isn't that the general truth already?

'''Sazanami''': ehem!!!

'''Others''': Yes Ma'am...

''The expedition fleet proceeds towards their destination... the naval base.''



==E-1 The combined fleet's unusual composition.==

'''Hiro''': Hmm...

'''Samidare''': Admiral, what is the problem?

'''Hiro''': Looks like our mortal enemy is not here today.

'''Samidare''': Phew! To think that she is here... That gave me the scare.

'''Hiro''': Well, fighting her is also an option. But I guess this is better. By the way...

'''Samidare''': ?

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Samidare''': What's the problem?

'''Hiro''': Well I think Taihou's time to shine is today.

'''Samidare''': Oh!

'''Hiro''': Samdiare. Please join the frontlines today. I need your support this time around.

'''Samidare''': Okay.



''Samidare went out to call other ships to fill the team that was needed in the campaign.''

'''Hiro''': We have Taihou, Souryuu, Nagato, Hyuuga, Kinugasa?, and Haguro in the main fleet and Abukuma, Ooi, Samidare, Choukai, Shigure and Hibiki in the escort fleet... I guess this would be good. Oh by the way. I want to see if hard is good enough for us.

'''Samidare''': Hard?

'''Ooi''': What nonsense did I just heard... You getting started on hard?

'''Hiro''': I doubt if you misprononunced some of those words, Samdiare will kill me immediately. But anyways. I wanted to test the waters if it's possible for us not get salty over this event.

'''Hyuuga''': I see...

'''Nagato''': and then, we can figth the loli boss character!!!

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Nagato''': Ehem! I mean the menacing Ne-class Heavy cruiser. (I am slipping out of my character...)

'''Hiro''': Yup. Anyways, Nagato... Please bring them the glory.

'''Nagato''': Alright!

'''Taihou''': Ummm...

'''Hiro''': Oh I almost forgot. Taihou, You are our flagship of this operation. Please lead us to victory.

'''Taihou''': Yes Admiral!!!

'''Hiro''': Good. Everyone. Sally forth and Bon Voyage!

'''the combined fleet''': YES!!!

The fleet went towards the waters for their hard run.



 Results: The fleet was a bit salted but it was managable. The Admiral changed difficulty to make things a bit breezy.

''Meanwhile.''

'''Sazanami''': it's an overkill, Master. By the way, when will I go to sortie?

'''Hiro''': E-4.

'''Sazanami''': E-4? I kinda wanted to greet Kazagumo-san too in E-1 since Master is so crazy looking for her.

'''Hiro''': I am just fulfilling Yuugumo-san's will. asides, I need someone who is a bit cool-headed.

'''Sazanami''': Whatever. By the way, why are you choosing Hard? Is that easy for them?

'''Hiro''': Kinda. But I am willing to settle to normal if things got a bit frustrating. I am saving a bit on buckets despite having around 470 of it.

'''Sazanami''': I see... so you want to make this fight a bit bearable despite being slightly at disadvantage.

'''Hiro''': yes. Also. I hate to deal with new opponents that I haven't defeated in any of my runs.

'''Sazanami''': That's the real reason isn't it Master?

'''Hiro''': Yup... So, let's see how things goes for the newly established team of ours.

'''Sazanami''': You can always count on them Master!

'''Hiro''': I see. Let them sail the seas now!

'''Sazanami''': Alright!

And thus the combined fleet has finally sortied towards the new enemy waters.


==E-1 intermission.==

'''Samidare''': Hibiki-san, Looks like your progress is getting so smooth. Looks like in no time you'll get your second remodel.

'''Hibiki''': I see... so this is his extended training regime...

'''Samidare''': Yes! He said that you are going to be an improtant member of the fleet. Also, he said that It's a great way for me to see if the enemies are strong or not.

'''Hibiki''': I guess so. Well then, let's go do our jobs as the escorts.

'''Samidare''': Yup.

'''Taihou''': You know what... I am so thankful he used me to sortie and he gave me this rare torpedo bomber and let Soryuu-san there to be our vanguard. Then we had Nagato-san for extra shelling and Hyuuga for support.

'''Hyuuga''': I just wanted to test my super zuiun.

'''Others''': (I knew she would say that...)

'''Nagato''': Fleet flagship, Are you detecting something there?

'''Taihou''': Yes... looks like it's time for us to work.

'''All''': YES!!!



''The battle begins.''

==Ooi's troubles; Abukuma's troubles.==

'''Ooi''': As always, I am separated from Kitakami-san and what's worse... is that this torpedo cruiser wannabe is with me. Such misfortune.

'''Abukuma''': What wannabe? I am a decently strong light cruiser!!!

'''Ooi''': Fine! Whatever!!! Why do I have to be paired at this Torpedo cruiser wannabe that wears Kagerou- class destroyer's spats!!! Ah. Kitakami-san, why do I have to be so far away from you!!!

'''Abukuma''': How rude! Spats are awesome. It gives you mobility and It gaves you the feeling that you are with the wind. Plus I don't have to worry about exposing my underwear.

'''Ooi''': As if someone will look at yout panties!

'''Abukuma''': Ganununununununu!!!

'''Ooi''': hehehehe.... but in the end of the day... I am superior in terms of torpedo and Night battles.

'''Abukuma''': But you are not allowed in the last area of our most recent campaign asides from this one.

'''Ooi''': ...

'''Abukuma''': Heheheh...

'''Ooi''': I really hate your guts!

'''Abukuma''': Me too...

''Choukai blocked the bickering duo.''

'''Choukai''': Stop this needless battles for now, the enemy is near.

'''Ooi''': Alright.

'''Abukuma''': Okay.

'''Hibiki''': I always wonder. Why won't the two get along at all?

'''Samidare''': Well, I guess Kitakami-san is the true culprit.



Meanwhile in the naval base

'''Kitakami''': Achoo!

'''Kiso''': looks like you have a cold.

'''Kitakami''': I wonder... It felt like someone mentions my name in a time like this. I wonder if Ooi-chi is fine working with Abukuma?

'''Kiso''': Don't worry. even if they don't really match, when it comes in defeating their opponents... No one can stand them.

'''Kitakami''': I hope so.

''The two torpedo cruisers wonder whether the two will help each other out.''


==Conspiracy theories==

'''Hiro''': Sazanami... have you ever wondered if why I wanted to clear this event no matter what?

'''Sazanami''': Not really much Master. But I'll ask anyways. Why do you want to clear it?

'''Hiro''': Because the sense of fulfillment was really that great. It makes you fell that all of your hardwork will be not in vain and plus we can lift one load out of our shoulder.

'''Sazanami''': well I guess you are right on that one. By the way. How can we get Kazagumo-san?

'''Hiro''': The usual runs to the boss could bring her out to the open. My only concern is that How can we get her.

'''Sazanami''': In the end I can't see whether or not you just wanted the skilled personnel she carries or the girl herself or it's because Yuugumo-san told you something like that. Anyways, I kinda wished Yuugumo-san returned to us to the base one day.

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Sazanami''': what's the matter Master?

'''Hiro''': Sorry. I just remembered something really important.

'''Sazanami''': Hmm... How weird that she didn't write letters nowadays despite her constant effort of sending them everyday to your mail... well, I just screened it so you don't have to read it.   

'''Hiro''': !?

'''Sazanami''': Master, looks like you wanted to say something to me yet, you can't say it at the moment. Was it about Yuugumo-san?

'''Hiro''': Kinda. But I can't really tell you right now...

'''Sazanami''': Okay. I'll just wait for the time you spit it out to my face. I can't have you worry over someone when it's this time of the year again.

'''Hiro''': Sorry. I'll say it to you once we are cleared of this battle week.

'''Sazanami''': Well then! Back to work. You need to be a bit professional in that aspect.

'''Hiro''': okay.

''The two waited for the results of the battle.''


==The before the Last dance of E-1.==

'''''After the Admiral saw the damaged done to the ships of his, he changed the difficulty of the battles and everything went in a breeze. So breezy that the Heavy cruisers didn't even need to fight.'''''

'''Haguro''': I wonder...

'''Kinugasa''': Why?

'''Haguro''': Well... I feel like we are just decorations this time around. I feel so useless today.

'''Kinugasa''': well... I guess since we are such an inbalanced team, when the Admiral changed the difficulty of our sorties, our escorts started make a killing... Abukuma and Ooi really hates each other's guts but fight side by side as if they are some kind of friends who are also rivals.

'''Haguro''': I see... By the way, Are you alright leaving your ledgers behind?

'''Kinugasa''': Honestly no. But Since the Admiral called my name and he insist that i should go out and take a breath of fresh air. He threw me into the most unstable team ever built with a battleship who loves kids, a seaplane bomber maniac, a russian returnee, a combat genius, a timid girl with great potential, one unlucky carrier and a carrier with a lot of fighting force and has a large asset, the Admiral's childhood friend is also here and the girl who is her older sister came here as support. Of course the accountant is also here to make sure we won't waste anymore resources.

'''Haguro''': I see... So, How are you with the Admiral?

'''Kinugasa''': Let's see... We already had our date a month ago and we went to a Hotel...

'''Haguro''': Hotel!!!???

'''Kinugasa''': By the way, I successfully seduced him using the...

'''Samidare''': (stares...)

'''Kinugasa''': My... I forgot that the childhood friend is here too... Do you want to know what happened? (looks Samidare with contempt)

'''Samidare''': It's fine. He told me the story a few weeks ago.

'''Kinugasa''': I see... (I wonder if she is bluffing)

'''Shigure''': Samidare... your hand...

'''Samidare''': It's fine... (I am going to hit the admiral with the torpedo after this sortie.) Don't worry about me.

'''Shigure''': Is that so...

'''Taihou''': Everyone... The opponent is already here. Ready to initiate our operation... everyone. Let's start shooting!

'''All''': Yeah!



''In the end, the Combined fleet successfully sunk the enemy boss of the first operations map.''


==After the battle (Samidare's decisive battle.)==

'''''After the sortie Samidare dragged the Admiral to the rooftop and shut the door in order to prevent more bystanders listening and gossiping.'''''

'''Hiro''': Samidare, Congrats on the job well done. Also... why do you release a chilling air despite showing that innocent smile of yours?

'''Samidare''': You see... I wanna know why you brought Kinugasa-san into a hotel in your date and... and... and... Waahh... Admiral... why do you keep getting away from me... Am I really that unneeded as of now? Am I that worthless girl today compared to others? Admiral, tell me why?

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Samidare''': Unfair, liar, cheater and most of all... why do I like a guy like you?

'''Hiro''': Sorry Samidare.

'''Samidare''': uuu... It hurts a lot. It really hurts... Why do I have to feel it?

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Samidare''': Admiral. I want to know the truth. Who do you want to spend your life with and tell it to right in my face! Right now! So that I can move on and start supporting her for all of her life.

'''Hiro''': I see... Looks like the time is now. Samidare, First of all. Thanks for being there for me whenever I am down. You always came to become m emotional guide and you are the one who made me realized what kind of a scum I have become. Thanks for taking care of me and the others. And... Sorry Samidare, I Already made up my mind. After making a consultation with Suzukaze on what should I do with my life. I finally arrived to the one true answer that I seek. Samidare. Sorry, you are not the one I will spend my whole life with. Even though you are the only person who can get the better of me and the girl who can make me feel calm... In the end, there was this girl who is more better than you.

'''Samidare''': I see... Who is she?

'''Hiro''': It's Sazanami.

''Time has stopped for the two of them... It felt like they bared out all of the things they are hiding and then...''

'''Samidare''': For a moment... I thought my heart would stop beating. And yet... I am crying to know that you will be alright with Sazanami-chan. I hated this feeling. I love you and I almost made you feel that way too... but in the end...

'''Hiro''': Sorry. But this time. I'll be a man and take a proper course of action.

'''Samidare''': I see... But can you fulfill my one last request before I formally give you to Sazanami-chan?

'''Hiro''': what is it?

'''Samidare''': (Whispers) Please love me for the last time and I'll give you the right to do whatever you want to my body. I want to have sex with you... Please fulfill this selfish request of mine. After that, Sazanami-chan is all yours and I won't bother making a request.

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Samidare''': You really are hopelessly indecisive aren't you.

Samidare dragged the admiral from the rooftop and into her room and then, she initiated her request... The admiral then do his part.


==Jintsuu's quest==

'''Jintsuu''': Strange, I thought the admiral called me a while ago but Sazanami is there on his stead. It makes me wonder what happened to him.

'''Sazanami''': You know, Master has a lot of things to deal with his two hands and also a lot of relations to close. Yup. He is kinda busy and he was dragged a while ago by Samidare... so It's fine.

'''Jintsuu''': I see... By the way, is it true that we are going into the battle now?

'''Sazanami''': Yup. I already called Yukikaze, Shigure, Ushio, Hibiki and Ayanami.

'''Jintsuu''': I see.

'''Sazanami''': By the way, some of you might have to change one of your radars into Drum canisters.

'''Ayanami''': Drum canisters?

'''Sazanami''': Yup. Because this time we don't need to sink the boss but It's preferrably that we sink her at all costs.

'''Jintsuu''': so it's like a hit-and-run tactic?

'''Sazanami''': Kinda, but it's more of '''Deliver-and-Destroy''' tactics. I think Master needs to rename a bit of the tactics just to be sure.

'''Ushio''': Sazanami-chan...

'''Sazanami''': What is it Ushio?

'''Ushio''': well... are there night battle nodes there too?

'''Sazanami''': Well... I guess you are hearing things... But it's true.

'''Ushio''': ...

'''Sazanami''': By the way. Please don't let yourselves get overrun by some new kind of opponents that some admirals said that they can survive a shelling from a battleship.

'''Jintsuu''': I see...

'''Ushio''': We will go now. Please take care.

'''Sazanami''': I will.

'''Shigure''': Sazanami-san, where is the admiral?

'''Sazanami''': I don't know. she was dragged by Samidare a while ago.

'''Shigure''': I see... I will leave too.

'''Hibiki''': Looks like the training still continues...

'''Sazanami''': Just take it easy. You'll be there in no time.

'''Hibiki''': Understood.

'''''The Torpedo squadron left the area and they went to fight the new opponents.'''''



==Intermission into E-2 boss==

'''Jintsuu''': Girls. how's our battle fairing?

'''Ayanami''': it's fine...

'''Shigure''': ...

'''Yukikaze''': I am still okay.

'''Hibiki''': I am still well...

'''Ushio''': ...

'''Jintsuu''': I guess we are still fine. By the way, what was that island a while ago?

'''Hibiki''': I think it was one of those deserted islands that we need to visit and drop something here along the run...

'''Jintsuu''': I see... But if we are unloading something here, what could it be?

'''Hibiki''': I think it's resources.

'''Jintsuu''': ...

'''Ayanami''': well now, It's useless to think things like this for now. By the way, can you tell me what is that?

'''Shigure''': ...

''They saw a silhouette of a abyssal cruiser of a ship-girl they knew.''





'''Jintsuu''': Somehow I knew who is that person? Was even that a person?

'''Hibiki''': We are at the boss node it seems.

'''Jintsuu''': All ships.. Prepare to battle!

The boss fight starts.




==VS. Light cruiser Princess.==

'''Jintsuu''': ...

'''CL Hime''': [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Light_Cruiser_Princess There is...no way back...for you......（Heh Heh Heh) ...It's already gone...! ]

'''Yukikaze''': Why does it feel like...

'''Ushio''': That... we already knew who she was...

'''Shigure''': And yet...

'''Ayanami''': Her presence scares us the most.

'''Hibiki''': But, nevertheless... We must defeat her. Everyone, are you with me?

'''All destroyers:''' Yeah.

'''CL Hime''': fufufufufu... It's time to draw blood... My old self...

'''Jintsuu''': Same to you... I'll make you bleed so hard... My fallen self.



''the battle progresses, and comes to a close.''


==The After report...==

'''''Jintsuu was summoned by the admiral to do a full report on the second area.'''''

'''Hiro''': Congratulations on the job well done. Say Jintsuu, what did you see out there. I was kinda busy with Samidare a while ago.

'''Jintsuu''': Thanks admiral By the way, I saw myself there at the boss area.

'''Hiro''': You? But I thought... Oh!

'''Jintsuu''': Why was she there? I wanted to save her from her own demise... But she said that i can't save her.

'''Hiro''': I see... So you two have communicated already. Say... Do you remember something about the past of a certain world?

'''Jintsuu''': I can't really remember...

'''Hiro''': Then, I'll tell you a story... You are once in a world where there was a massive scale war occured and those who were caught by it has their lives changed forever.

'''Jintsuu''': how was I included on that world?

'''Hiro''': The second map was the re-enactment of the battle of Kolombangara. In this battle, You and the other destroyers were transporting soldiers to an island. It's similar to tokyo express altogether. But one night, you and your squadron engaged to the allies and in the end, the allies retreated but you sunk in the course of the battle.

'''Jintsuu''': I see... So she was the me that sank in that world.

'''Hiro''': Yes. But, it's also the manifestation of all the negative thoughts of you from every parallel worlds available. Plus the people on-board of it and the ship's pre-existing feelings.

'''Jintsuu''': I see.

'''Hiro''': Do you hate wars?

'''Jintsuu''': I don't know...

'''Hiro''': I hated it. for as long as I can remember... I kill to survive yet I never knew if they are angry at me or not. I just storm bases and create a pool of blood of those soldiers I've killed as a one man-army. I was thankful that abyssals came.

'''Jintsuu''': Why was that?

'''Hiro''': Because of that... wars were postponed and the nations who were at war with one another became rivals in developing new technology. By the way they are at a race to create more artificial Ship-girls so that the real ones can retire.

'''Jintsuu''': but it doesn't solve the crisis at hand.

'''Hiro''': Yup. That was the bloody truth. but... they did it anyways... Until 120 years ago.

'''Jintsuu''': Admiral, can I care to ask. Is it alright to tell those stories? I am not as great as you appraised me to be.

'''Hiro''': It's fine Since I've got an audience already. I better start hitting the talk button. The next operation is tomorrow so all of us can take a rest and be lazy for a while.

'''Jintsuu''': I guess you are correct.

'''Hiro''': well then...



''With the growing crowd, the admiral has started the lecture about how ship-girls come into the equations of peace in the growing threats of the abyssal forces.''



==At a certain island...==

'''Seaplane-tender Princess''': Looks like it's my turn now.

'''CL Hime''': ...

'''Seaplane tender Princess''': Are you really that quiet?

'''CL Hime''': I am not quiet at all. But the instance I've met the other me... I felt envious of her.

'''Seaplane tender Princess''': How? Could it be...

'''CL Hime''': I was surprised to see how strong I really am even without these demonic powers I had, I can still be as good as her.

'''Seaplane tender Princess''': What a bore. I thought You are interested in her Admiral.

'''CL Hime''': Well... The only Admiral I ever follow is the one who ride me in my night battles. Not some avarage dude that came out of nowhere.

'''Seaplane tender Princess''': Oh, but he is no ordinary Admiral. I've heard he himself brought the Air defense princess to her knees three times. But, his only weakness was...

'''CL Hime''': He was totally attached to his girls. I know that. He is somewhat like my admiral in one way or the other. But, To think that there was a guy who can bring the princess down three times. He sure is one heck of a person.

'''Seaplane tender Princess''': well then. It's time for me to settle the score once more...

Seaplane tender princess left and cruise her way to her own territory.



==E-3 the introduction chapter.==

'''Hiro''': Well, well... The hardest part of the battle is here. the last map of our regular campaign.

'''Sazanami''': I see. By the way, why are you with Samidare that time?

'''Hiro''': I decided to man up and go tell her what are my true feelings.

'''Sazanami''': I see... Well, how did it went (not that I am interested)

'''Hiro''': Well, she cried a bit but she dragged me a lot and we are kinda caught in the moment and...

''Sazanami stepped on the Admiral's foot and she punched the admiral's stomach and hits the Admiral's shin.''

'''Hiro''': OOoooowww... For a sec... I thought I was a goner.

'''Sazanami''': Humph. That's what happens to you when you tell me that you did it with her... Shitty Admiral.

'''Hiro''': I see... Somehow, you are nailing Akebono's lines perfectly...

'''Sazanami''': hmp...

'''Hiro''': Sorry about that. say, you want to know what I told Samidare?

'''Sazanami''': Fine... I don't want to hear it...

'''Hiro''': I see...

'''Sazanami''': By the way, they had arrived.

'''Hiro''': eh...

'''Maya''': what is the ruckus you are talking about Admiral?

'''Choukai''': Umm... Sorry about that Admiral.

'''Hiro''': well. Better start it right now.



'''''The team consist of:'''''
Hyuuga, Yuudachi, Hibiki, Samidare, Ushio, Mogami - main team<br />Abukuma, Shigure, Ayanami, Yukikaze, Maya, Choukai - escort team.



'''Hiro''': with this, we can attain air superiority against the seaplane tender princess and we can whack her hard.

'''Abukuma''': Umm... Is this true that I'm carrying the landing craft rather than the mini-sub?

'''Hiro''': Yup. It's just there to cut cost.

'''Abukuma''': Costs?

'''Hiro''': The cost of repairing you whenever you messed up.

'''Abukuma''': Eeeehh!!!

'''Samidare''': He is just kidding, Abukuma-san.

'''Abukuma''': Thanks.

'''Samidare''': By the way Abukuma-san, you are a destroyer right?

'''Abukuma''': Waaaah!!! why do you love to bully me!?

'''Hiro''': Shigure, please don't let our hardworker cry like that.

'''Shigure''': Okay.

'''Hiro''': You can put duct tape if you are annoyed though.

'''Sazanami''': Hey...

'''Hiro''': Kidding asides. I want you to watch out against the PT boats. It seems our Team composition will go to that place where they infest.

'''Sazanami''': why do you say the word Infest?

'''Hiro''': because it's a map where the majority of the enemies are those strange baby-like creatures.

'''Sazanami''': Scary...

'''Hiro''': Anyways, Off to the seas!

'''Combined fleet''': Yeah!!!

the combined fleet left and they do their sortie.




==PT boats from hell... (Emergency transmission: E-3)==

'''[[File:E-3_lol.png|thumb|400px|transmission: danger warning - High!]]Hiro''': What is our status report?

'''Sazanami''': Our escort fleet suffered great damage against the pack of PT imps.

'''Hiro''': Damn It!!! They are a lot tougher that I thought.

'''Sazanami''': Well Master, what should we do?

'''Hiro''': Isn't that obvious. We are retreating.

'''Sazanami''': Alright.

''Sazanami sent a retreat signal over the skies to order the fleet to go home.''

'''Abukuma''': Ehh... We are going back?

'''Samidare''': Looks like we need to regroup.

'''Shigure''': Yup.

'''Yukikaze''': ...

'''Ayanami''': Ow... that really hurts.

'''Maya''': Understood. I am useless today...

'''Choukai''': Maya-chan...

''the whole fleet returned home.''



==The PT boats from hell... (reorganization)==

'''Sazanami''': So, what is the problem in our last battle?

'''Samidare''': The Imps are invunerable and they do torpedo strikes like there's no tomorrow.

'''Hiro''': I see... This indeed alarming.

'''Maya''': ...

'''Hiro''': Maya, are you hurt?

'''Maya''': My pride it is. I was 2-shotted by the late-model elite destroyer. Such shame I can't bare to carry all my life.

'''Hiro''': There, there... don't cry (Pats Maya's head)

'''Choukai''': ...!?

'''Sazanami''': well Master, what shall we do?

'''Hiro''': Let's change the main team and let us avoid that road.

'''Samidare''': !?

'''Hiro''': I'll be putting Ooyodo as our flagship and adding the lady to the group.

'''Akatsuki''': I knew it!

'''Hiro''': Do your best from now on.

'''Akatsuki''': Yup.



'''''reorganized fleet:<br />Ooyodo, Hibiki, Ushio, Samidare, Yuudachi, Akatsuki - Main fleet<br />Abukuma, Maya, Shigure, Choukai, Ayanami, Yukikaze - Escort fleet'''''


'''Hiro''': Do your best and bring the AV-hime down

'''Combined fleet:''' Yeah!



''the combined fleet sortied once more.''

'''Hyuuga''': Admiral... Sorry if we can't be much help of you.

'''Mogami''': Yes! Me too!!!

'''Hiro''': Don't cry. Don't worry. You might get one more opportunity to fight once again. Look straight and be proud of your achievement!

'''Mogami''': Yes!

'''Hyuuga''': Yeah!

'''Hiro''': well then, Looks like it's time to see if my action will work.



''The two left and the admiral contacteded Sazanami via radio, who was watching the exchange at the distace a bit far from home,''

'''Sazanami''': Master, I wish you are with me today.

'''Hiro''': Yup. me too... Don't worry. I'll go there at the last dance.

'''Sazanami''': That's a promise then!

'''Hiro''': Yup. You can count on me.



and then, there were no more hitches after that.



==Kashima==

'''''After the battle was over and the mission was complete.'''''

'''Samidare''': Phew. That was close. I thought we would be unable to fight that crazy girl, but we managed anyways.

'''Abukuma''': Yup... somehow.

''then a certain figure approaches them.''

'''Kashima''': Umm... who are you? Where are we?

'''Ooyodo''': Hello there, you must be Kashima.

'''Kashima''': Yup. Are you perhaps...

'''Ooyodo''': I am Ooyodo.

'''Kashima''': I see... by the way, what place is this?

'''Ooyodo''':  I believe the Admiral can tell you everything about this world. so then, shall we go?

'''Kashima''': okay.



''Kashima went with the combined fleet back to the naval base.''

==The Arrival of a silver colored mystery==

''In the Admiral's office. Kashima officially introduces herself.''

'''Kashima''': Good evening. I am Kashima. I am a Training Cruiser. Nice to meet you.

'''Sazanami''': Nice to meet ya!

'''Hiro''': Me too...

'''Kashima''': Eh!? (somewhat the two seemed to be really lax at the moment.) Umm...

'''Hiro''': You are Takane Shijou right?

'''Kashima''': eh?

'''Sazanami''': Wait Master, she is not that girl...

'''Hiro''': But look at her silver hair and her mysterious demeanor and her sense of elegance befitting of a high-class ojou-sama. You must be Takane Shijou right? Right?

'''Kashima''': Ummm...

''Samidare enters the room.''

'''Samidare''': Please don't haze the newbie already!

'''Hiro''': Sorry.

'''Sazanami''': Sorry too.

'''Samidare''': Fine. When the two of you are in the same wavelenght, these things bound to happen. What can you two do without me?

'''Hiro''': (Samidare's matured now? Is she in the rebellious phase?) ...

'''Sazanami''': (Wow! to be able to speak like that? I am impressed. What did happened between her and the admiral and the tranformation is already visible?) ...

'''Kashima''': Thanks Samidare-chan. I was beginning to think I was Shijou Takane. By the way who is she?

'''Samidare''': Here... (shows a tablet image of Takanae Shijou)

'''Kashima''': The IdolM@ster... Eh!!!



'''Hiro''': Anyways, let's cut this non-sense of an introduction ever, and let us reintroduce ourselves. I am the Raven of the Raven's base. I am Admiral Raven!

'''Sazanami''': I am the newly promoted Executive Secretary and now the right hand of the Admiral. I am Sazanami. Nice meeting you.

'''Samidare''': I am the newly appointed Deputy secretay and the left hand of the Admiral, I am Samidare. Nice meeting you Kashima-san.

'''Kashima''': Wow...

'''Hiro''': Now then since the intros are done. I am explaining some random boring facts.

'''Kashima''': Boring?

'''Hiro''': First of all, you are not from this world and you are just a figment of the hope of many crewship Kashima has... or you could be the ship itself. Secondly, We didn't have the World War 2 you speak of. But there was a widescale territory war in the areas before the abyssals came around 150 years ago. But there are still disputes over there so I'll skip it since it's not important to you ship-girls. And lastly, you are here to aid other ships towards their growth plus you are also here to destroy the threat of the mankind, The Abyssals.

'''Kashima''': I see... By the way, what's with the human body?

'''Hiro''': it's your container that holds your pure soul. It's a sacred vessel prepared for ship-girls that are born into this world. But there are also humans who have been granted the power to fight abyssals and they are also here.

'''Kashima''': I see. Can I ask one more question?

'''Hiro''': what is it?

'''Kashima''': Is Katori here?

'''Hiro''': Yup. As a matter of fact, she is your roommate.

'''Kashima''': Thanks Admiral.

'''Hiro''': Samidare, Please escort Kashima to her room.

'''Samidare''': Okay.



''Samidare escorted Kashima to her room to where Katori is still there. The two reunited for the first time.''


in the office.

'''Hiro''': Phew... I almost went beserk.

'''Sazanami''': I knew you are staring at her intently... Shitty Admiral.

'''Hiro''': please drop that catch phrase. I am feeling shitty right now.

'''Sazanami''': Oh Ho... I see. So Master, what did say to Samidare yesterday. What did she asked?

'''Hiro''': well she asked 'who shall I spend my life with?'

'''Sazanami''': So your answer was Samidare, right?

'''Hiro''': Nope...

'''Sazanami''': !!!

'''Hiro''': On the contrary... The answer to that is...

'''Sazanami''': ...Was it me, Master?

'''Hiro''': Yeah.

'''Sazanami''': ... (blushed)

'''Hiro''': ... (blushed)

'''Sazanami''': you see... Can I ...



''Suzukaze enters...''

'''Suzukaze''': Yo guys!!! eh... why are you two looked like you have a high fever developing?

'''Hiro''': Wait Suzukaze! it's not fever!

'''Suzukaze''': Oh. You are back to normal.

'''Sazanami''': Well then... (reverts back), what is the purpose of your visit Suzukaze?

'''Suzukaze''': I've heard the rumours from the other Admirals that Prinz Eugen is obtainable this time around.

'''Hiro''': !!!

'''Sazanami''': !!!

'''Suzukaze''': She is in E-4!

'''Hiro''': Sazanami, what are you waiting for. Gather up the fleet!. We'll be hitting E-4 today!

'''Sazanami''': Okay Master.



Sazanami went out and call the other ship-girls needed for the operation.

'''Suzukaze''': Yo Hiro-san, how are you feeling nowadays?

'''Hiro''': I am a bit fine now thanks to your actions. Say, did you actually defeated an abyssal Admiral a few days ago?

'''Suzukaze''': Yup. He is weak but too intelligent. He managed to trick us all and he was doing these to destroy the internal affairs of the base. I was pretty sure that incident regarding Yuugumo was just step one of his plans.

'''Hiro''': So why did he get himself defeated?

'''Suzukaze''': I really don't know. But since geniuses pops out of nowhere. They are easier to deal with.

'''Hiro''': Yup. Thanks for the Advice. I am slowly doing it now. I already said my true feelings to Samidare and Sazanami. Next will be Kinugasa, then it will be Kumano and to Sazanami once more for the official part.

'''Suzukaze''': Okay. Goodluck on that!

'''Hiro''': Yup. Wish me luck.

Suzukaze left the room and Sazanami enters with the team for the extra operations.


==There are always celebrations even between sorties.==

'''''The ships listed for the Extra Operations are the following: (Surface task force)<br />Ooyodo, Maya, Musashi, Nagato, Kirishima, Kaga - Main fleet<br />Isuzu, Hibiki, Ushio, Sazanami, Kitakam, Kiso - Support fleet'''''

''On the way to the boss''

'''Sazanami''': (Ah. Master seemed to be in a good mood today. But to think it's not Samidare he wants to spend his life with... who could it be. I was sure it was her. But then. I think he said it was me. Aaah! I am so loving this.) ♫♫♫

'''Musashi''': Little girl, You seemed delighted today.

'''Sazanami''': Well, Master confessed his feelings to me. I can't wait for the formal announcement.

'''Musashi''': That's good to hear.

''Ushio who heard the conversation earlier was surprised.''

'''Ushio''': Really!

'''Hibiki''': Congratulations! Secretary ship.

'''Sazanami''': you are welcome



''Meanwhile, Kiso also heard the news''

'''Kiso''': ... (Looks like my battle is over)

'''Kitakami''': Hey Kisocchi, you seemed a bit down today. are you sick? Are you in pain?

'''Kiso''': It hurts... in my heart.

'''Kitakami''': Well that's normal in love. Asides, there's no way our lovely little sister can win against the girl who moved him to start this all out war against the abyssals.

'''Kiso''': You might be right Kitakami-nee.

'''Kitakami''': well then. Put your frustrations into good use and hit the opponents like how much you hated to lose.

'''Kiso''': Yeah!



''In the main fleet.''

'''Ooyodo''': (Looks like the Admiral is serious this time around. Congratulations Secretary-chan for winning his heart.)

'''Kirishima''': (The Admiral...; Well then, time to support Sazanami-san for her sake.)

'''Kaga''': (Looks like the indecisive Admiral has started to move on his way out of the harem vacuum. I better confess my feelings for Akagi-san now.) ...

'''Nagato''': (Congratulations Sazanami-chan. As a gift. I'll create a wedding dress that will make the Admiral fall head over heels to you once more and I'll add a feature that will make you irresistable to the Admiral.)

Isuzu who was humming all along was a bit curious:

'''Isuzu''': what's the fuzz all about?

'''Musashi''': This little girl won the Admiral's heart!

'''Isuzu''': Really!?

'''Sazanami''': Yup♫.

'''Isuzu''': Congrats.



''the air was a bit celebratory and then...''

'''Ooyodo''': I've picked up some signal from the area nearby.

'''Musashi''': well then. Time to make our visit counts!



''And the battle starts.''


==The reunion...==

'''Battleship Princess''': Nice seeing you again Little girl...

'''Sazanami''': I don't have time dealing with you though. Out target is your flasghip.

'''Ushio''': Yup...

'''Musashi''': Say Battleship princess, How about another round with me?

'''Battleship Princess''': Fine by me. Bring it on!



'''Kitakami''': Waah... This brings back memories.

'''Kiso''': why was that?

'''Kitakami''': You see... I fought her along with Ushio-chan and Samidare-san last spring plus with Haruna and Hiei and back then, she was a weakling in the night battle node.

'''Kiso''': You don't say...

'''Kitakami''': For as long at you hit her to red. Then, it's fine for all of us. Isn't it?

'''Kiso''': You are right.

Battlship Princess overheard the conversation of the two torpedo cruisers.



'''Battlship Princess''': Ah... That wretched torpedo cruiser who one-shots me last spring. I'm glad you are also here. Prepare to pay dearly!

'''Kitakami''': nope. Not today.



''and the battle starts.''


==What I don't need... I get them.==

'''Hiro''': First, we got Nowaki in E-2.

'''Sazanami''': It's good. Isn't it?

'''Hiro''': Then we got Tokitsukaze in E-4.

'''SazanamI''': wow! Your luck is great.

'''Hiro''': Where is Graf Zeppelin? U-511? Prinz Eugen? Where are they when I needed them the most?

'''Sazanami''': Calm down Master. They'll be coming to the base once you got them.

'''Hiro''': Thanks Sazanami for the affirmation.

'''Sazanami''': You can always count on me! (somewhat imitates Ikazuchi's confidence)

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Tokitsukaze''': Admiral!!! Play with me!

'''Nowaki''': Tokitsukaze... Please hold yourself down.

'''Sazanami''': But indeed. it is a storm brewing...

'''Hiro''': Yeah.

''The two drink tea as they watch the trouble unfolds in front of them.''


==The life of the couple who looked like a married couple but not yet officially lovers.==

'''Hiro''': Sazanami...

'''Sazanami''': Here Master... (gives tea to the Admiral)

'''Hiro''': Thanks.

'''Sazanami''': You're welcome♫



''the spectators were awestruck by the development that happened a while ago.''

'''Sendai''': ...

'''Kawakaze''': ...

'''Shigure''': ...

'''Samidare''': why are you three looked so dumbfounded?

'''Sendai''': You see... this was the first time we saw Sazanami-san smiled sincerely. Right Shigure?

'''Shigure''': Yup... I was kinda lost for words there...

'''Kawakaze''': To think that there's someone who can smile as sincere as yours... I am too envious. Plus, I am starting to see her in a different light too.

'''Samidare''': Ah! I already know the answer... But, I rather not spill it out until he made an annoucement.

'''Sendai''': eeeeehhhh!!!

'''Shigure''': Somehow, you seemed not affected by this development at all.

'''Samidare''': As a matter of fact...

''Shigure looked at Samidare's hand and she saw Samidare holding a knife that was slightly pointed forward.''

'''Kawakaze''': Somehow, I can't sense that she is willing to kill...

'''Shigure''': It scares me the most to see her like that.

'''Sendai''': ADMIRAL!!! SONEONE TURNED YANDERE AGAIN!!!



'''Hiro''': This is bad...

and the clearing up was tougher than expected.




==E-5 pre-sorties.==

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Sazanami''': Master, what's the matter?

'''Hiro''': I have the right people for the job... But I want to put a bit of excitement here.

'''Sazanami''': Like what?

'''Hiro''': I need a bit of handicap like...

'''Sazanami''': Let me guess... No support shelling, like you always do?

'''Hiro''': Yup. Plus... I am sending you out to E-5!

'''Sazanami''': !!!

'''Hiro''': So are you chickened out now?

'''Sazanami''': Now I know why Ushio was so scared when you asked her to become the ace... Heheheheh... Master, I'll take it! I'll show you my true power.

'''Hiro''': That's great. Now. Time to call them, By the way... I fyou feel like you can't do it... call me and I'll go there immediately and carry you out of battle in a princess carry.

'''Sazanami''': Master... No need to sweat things through. I am not going to quit this battle.

'''Hiro''': Good. Now. Time to sortie!

'''Sazanami''': Yes Master!


==Fleet info for E-5.==

''the team composition for today's run at E-5 are the following.''

'''Flagship''': Sendai (Yasen freak, ninja of the house) (75)<br />'''Second ship ''': Kawakaze (Standby guard, axe wielder at trainings... not yet good at all) (35)<br />'''Third ship''': Yuudachi (newly remodeled. was thrown straight into the frontlines [not to mentioned to the extra operations map]) (55)<br />'''Fourth ship''': Shigure (The cool and calm beauty. They said that her patience is three times longer than Samidare's patience... But lately, if Samidare's not feeling good; she immediately blaming herself for not being able to help her.) (62)<br />'''Fifth Ship''': Kitakami (The mischievous, carefree Torpedo cruiser. No one knows how She and Ooi remained untied but some speculations says that she was hesitating in dealing with Ooi... Kitakami-san, good luck!) (73)<br />'''Last ship''': Sazanami (the office secretary, the Admiral's left hand [she was promited to right hand now] and the pinch hitter of the team) (65)


'''Sazanami''': Hmm... I think this draft from Aoba-san sure is lovely isn't it Sendai-san?

'''Sendai''': well I don't know about that. Afterall I can't understand what's a 'freak' after all.

'''Kitakami''': It's pointless and it's tastelss article for me.

'''Shigure''': me too...

'''Yuudachi''': poi?

'''Kawakaze''': I looked like a weakling here...

'''Sazanami''': Say, how about we storm the PR room after this?

'''Others''': Agreed!

''the torpedo squadron cruise the area that has crazy battles up ahead.''



==The PT boats of a different Dimension.==

'''Sazanami''': It's night time and the hard headed PT boats are here... Any Ideas?

'''Sendai''': Just jab and run like a certain boxer does.

'''Kawakaze''': Hack them in two if possible.

'''Kitakami''': Sendai... You better leave that to the destroyer Shrimps.

'''Yuudachi''': Hey... That's unfair!

'''Shigure''': Well then, Please don't get hit to red... Kitakami-san.

'''Kitakami''': who do you think I am?

'''Sazanami''': People... we are here. and prepare for battle.



The team fought valiantly and the finished the node unscathe.



==I can't believe Hagikaze is an abyssal.==

'''Sendai''': I can detect some presence here...

'''Kitakami''': Well then! It's boss time!

'''Destroyer Oni:''' [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Destroyer_Water_Demon It's really...the night...? Re...ally....scary...isn't it..? ]

'''Sazanami''': Well. At least we are still alive. I guess 4 PT boats are nothing for us folks. Plus our Sadistic Master decided not to show some love and decided not to send out a support shelling for this one.

'''Shigure''': Is he for real?

'''Yuudachi''': Well then. Looks like I want to get the credit for killing the boss.

'''Kawakaze''': Nope... It would be me!!!

'''Hiro '''(other side of the communicationdevice): How about the credit goes to Kitakami herself. Afterall...

'''Shigure''': Well, well... I guess we'll managed this thing once and for all.

'''Kitakami''': Folks, let's not make her wait any longer... For tonight, WE'LL SINK YOU AND THOSE FRIGGING BUGGERS DOWN TO THE DEEP ABYSS!!!



and the battle rages on!

==After the tiring transport runs... (not really)==

'''Hiro''': The last dance... yes!!! We can clear it. We can say goodbye to this wretched operations!!!

'''Sazanami''': Well. Nice to hear that from you master. But let me remind you that I don't feel any excitement when I am carrying a drum canister. It felt like my life was only created to carry these wretched equipments.

'''Hiro''': well. You are certainly right for that. But comparing to E-4... this was a bit hectic for you right?

'''Sazanami''': Well... I can't deny it.

'''Sendai''': Admiral, Please stop talking to her at the moment! we are at the boss node right now!

'''Hiro''': Sorry. Just a force of habit.

The Admiral cut his direct com line.

'''Samidare''': Well, well Admiral... You really missed Sazanami-chan don't you. I am here to comfort you for now...

'''Hiro''': No thanks. I am a man. I must be strong for the girl I love.

'''Samidare''': Wow! back then... you'll take up my offer whenever it is possible. You really are serious in asking her out now.

'''Hiro''': Well. That's my plan. Now... I have to worried about Kinugasa and Kumano's troubles if I decided to cut off the faux engagement promise.

'''Samidare''': It'll be hard.

'''Hiro''': Yup.

The transmission from Sazanami came in a few moments after...

'''Sazanami''': The transport mission is a success. We are cleared now!

'''Hiro''': Good! Let's celebrate!



But the team realized the bitter truth...




==The boss guage==

'''[[File:E-5_madness56786854787675587.png|thumb|400px|the boss bar...]]Hiro''': ...

'''Sazanami''': Wow...

'''Hiro''': Looks like farming is over...

'''Sazanami''': well then... Let's get back to work.

'''Hiro''': Wait!

'''Sazanami''': !?

'''Hiro''': Change the useless drums into Radars and Sendai...

'''Sendai''': What is it for me?

'''Hiro''': Carry a seaplane will you? I hate dead-ending...

'''Sendai''': Okay!

'''Sazanami''': Okay. Off to the boss we sail.

'''All''': OH!!!

''the fleet was then returned to the sea once more.''

==The Boss killings. (gambling chapter)==

'''Sendai''': Hmm... since we are still having to go all out, how about I wager something?

'''Sazanami''': I refuse. I can't win it anyways.

'''Shigure''': Fine by me.

'''Yuudachi''': Yup. Count me in.

'''Kawakaze''': I'll show Shiratsuyu-Aneki that I deserve to be No.1.

'''Kitakami''': Go. I'll win it anyways.

'''Sazanami''': I'll pass... just let me write the conditions and be the witness so everyone can't cheat their way out.

'''Others''': Okay.

'''Sendai''': here is our wager...

 If Someone gets MVP the winner will order the losers to do:
 a. If Sendai wins, everyone in the fleet minus Sazanami will do a night battle sortie.
 b. If Kitakami wins, she will force Ooi on the rest of them and let them taste her wrath.
 c. If Shigure wins, the losers will help Samidare in winning the Admiral's heart.
 d. If Yuudachi wins, She'll make the losers eat her sunday meal share and Yuudachi will eat the limited food plates. (It is a general truth that Kuro's turn of cooking is always serious business).
 e. If Kawakaze wins, the other girls will make her feel that she is the number 1.
 f. If Sazanami wins, all of them will be punished by Sazanami because of gambling.

'''Sazanami''': Well I added a condition in case I won.

'''Sendai''': Eh!?

'''Sazanami''': Then, get back to work!!!

'''Others''': Yeah!!!

''and they proceeded to battle.''


==The 'hatless' boss.==

'''Sendai''': Something's weird?

'''Sazanami''': Me too?

'''Kitakami''': well then... Let's start the party then!

[[File:E-5_end._wow!.png|thumb|400px|And with this, I finished the Event like mad.]]



'''Destroyer Oni''': It's night eh...? The darkness of the night is... scary, scary... ufufufu... AHAHAHAHA!

'''Sendai''': Well... let's go and rescue one of our friends!!!

'''Kitakami''': I will win this time!

'''Shigure''': Yup... If you try.

'''Destroyer Oni''': We'll see for that... weaklings.

'''Sazanami''': She spoke.

'''Sendai''': Yup...

'''PT Imps''': Ahahahaahahahah!

'''Sazanami''': Let's take this ship out and off we go back to where my Master Awaits!

'''Others''': Oh!!!!



in the end, they won despite having many ships at heavy damage.

==Kazagumo farming operations==

'''''[The operation follows a simple rule. One must get Kazagumo at all costs.]'''''

'''Hiro''': (Sips tea) Hmm... somehow things got a lot hectic than the usual?

'''Sazanami''': well... We are in a busy time of the day Master.

'''Hiro''': Yup. It's farming session and It somehow remids me on the Roma Farm and we managed to get her before calling it a day.

'''Sazanami''': We just got lucky afterall.

'''Hiro''': Yup. But...

'''Sazanami''': You are somehow tense Master?

'''Hiro''': because All I get is Rare Kagero class DD that I don't really need... Damn It. Why do they have to come now?

'''Sazanami''': well... It's what you called divind retribution. Master, how come you really hate getting beaten by an uncertain opponent if that opponent doesn't exist anyways?

'''Hiro''': it's must be a grand design made by someone who rolls a 20-face die.

'''Sazanami''': You really are a sore loser, Master...

'''Hiro''': Well, I am just a sore loser.

'''Sazanami''': well then...



''Then a message came from the team...''

'''Hiro''': What's the report?

'''Team Leader''': We got Suzuya Again.

'''Hiro''': Damn It!!!

'''Sazanami''': Failed again... As always. Master, you want some more?

'''Hiro''': Yup. By the way, good job and take a rest for now. Please come back there after an hour.

'''Team Leader''': Thanks Admiral.

'''Hiro''': Well... How was Kuro's treating you?

'''Team Leader''': ...

'''Hiro''': I guess you can just say 'I can't tell you Admiral'.

'''Team Leader''': Okay. Admiral, can I ask you something?

'''Hiro''': What is it?

'''Team Leader''': well... can I go and sleep...

'''Hiro''': Nope. I do allow relationships but I will not allow it. I pretty much guess he will just kick you out of his room. So Katsuragi... Please let him do what he does. If he will go to your side. then make sure he will not let you go.

'''Team Leader''': Okay Admiral.

'''Hiro''': You are all dismissed. Report after the next Hour.

'''Team Leader''': Yes!

''The Admiral turned off the radio and took the cup of tea that Sazanami brew.''

'''Sazanami''': So how's Katsuragi-san?

'''Hiro''': As always, she wants to grow fast. I guess that's what happens when the man you like loves a mature woman.

'''Sazanami''': Yup. So Master, when will be the after-party?

'''Hiro''': December 6... It'll be a grand party.

'''Sazanami''': Noted.

'''Hiro''': I'll be saying a grand annoucement this time around.

'''Sazanami''': Kitakore!

'''Hiro''': So... are you ready?

'''Sazanami''': Of course I am ready. I waited for this.

'''Hiro''': Okay. Now then, I'll need to tell the other girls the truth.

'''Sazanami''': like Kumano-san and Kinugasa-san?

'''Hiro''': Yup. They need to know the truth before the annoucement date.

'''Sazanami''': I see... But will you be alright?

'''Hiro''': Yup. I am pretty sure that things will go fine in the end.

'''Sazanami''': I pray that you may succeed.

'''Hiro''': Thanks.

'''Sazanami''': Well then Master, how shall we deal with the problem again?

'''Hiro''': well... I guess we shop till we drop. (Damn, I had a hard time getting Kazagumo)

'''Sazanami''': well... I guess it's the best way possible for us to win.

'''Hiro''': Yup.

'''Sazanami''': was this for Yuugumo-san's will?

'''Hiro''': Yup. I had to repay her kindness.

'''Sazanami''': !?

'''Hiro''': Well then. Let's take a rest for a while and drink the tea that you made.

'''Sazanami''': Okay Master...

'''Hiro''': We are alone for now. Call me Hiro whenever we are alone. Can you?

'''Sazanami''': Yup... Hiro-san.

'''Hiro''': That's great.

''the two chat over tea and planned everything they wanted to do in the future as lovers.''




==Results of Kazagumo farming operations==

'''Hiro''': Yes! After two straight days of some kind of torture... We finally got Kazagumo! Yay!

'''Sazanami''': I don't know about that... after all, I have to look after some potential rival.

'''Hiro''': Well. I am paying some of my debt of gratitude that I have from Yuugumo.

'''Sazanami''': Yup. But Master, It's been a while since you mentioned her name. Are you already in good terms?

'''Hiro''': As if we are enemies to begin with. But the world we lived in is a sad and cruel one. I made a mistake and got her killed because of me.

'''Sazanami''': Well. It's a bit sad on my part that she had to go. So you are atoning your sins to Kazagumo-chan instead?

'''Hiro''': Well, She did mentioned that I have to save her sisters, Especially her. So I think getting Kazagumo here is my priority as an Admiral. Also... I had heard from Yuugumo she is a good cook.

'''Sazanami''': So you want to fill in to that sad slot in the kitchen?

'''Hiro''': Yup. The sundays are a terror to all of them.

'''Sazanami''': I am glad you know it already.

'''Hiro''': So who gets the end of the stick?

'''Sazanami''': Our carriers... Especially Kaga and Akagi, but they are unfazed. The Low luck Battleships ate these food and Taihou eats that.

'''Hiro''': Hmm... I am somehow sad for Taihou. Well...

There was a knock on the door...

'''Kazagumo''': May I come in?

'''Sazanami''': You can come in.

''The door opened and there a girl that was somehow a representative of fall colors arrived.''

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Sazanami''': At first, I was shock to see Kumano in her younger years.

'''Kazagumo''': Kumano?

'''Hiro''': Well Kazagumo. Welcome to Raven's Base! I am Admiral Raven and Here is my right hand and Secretary

'''Sazanami'''. She is in charge of almost everything that's happening inside the base. The girl in the other room is my left hand and chief Deputy, Her name is Samidare.

'''Sazanami''': I am the right hand of Admiral Raven, I am Sazanami. I am the secretary ship and the relay center of the Admiral. Well nice meeting you too.

'''Kazagumo''': Nice meeting you too...

''Kazagumo Shakes Sazanami's hand and was somehow awed by the aura the two releases.''

'''Kazagumo''': Are you perhaps... Dating?

'''Hiro''': Well...

'''Sazanami''': Master and I... we looked like we are dating already?

'''Hiro''': If she thinks that way, then it must be true...

'''Kazagumo''': Umm... I am here. Please don't ignore me...

'''Hiro''': Ehem... Well, We are not yet dating. But, we are almost in the stage that we would be dating... right?

'''Sazanami''': Master, I thought you would tell her the truth?

'''Hiro''': Sorry. Anyways, I am dating her already.

'''Kazagumo''': I knew it!

'''Sazanami''': So, why did you asked?

'''Kazagumo''': You see. Before I spawned into this world. I met Yuugumo-nee who was giggling to see me born into this world.

'''Sazanami''': When I heard of giggling, All I can remember are those boats from hell.

'''Hiro''': Yeah. I think I developed a trauma in listening to the torpedo boats from hell.

'''Kazagumo''': Hmm... Anyways, Yuugumo-nee told me to take care of the admiral who has smitten by a pink-haired girl.

'''Hiro''': Somehow, I am scared of how calculative she was despite being dead.

'''Sazanami''': Well... I guess she was just looking out for you.

'''Hiro''': Yup. She was indeed a sweet girl. By the way, Kazagumo. Can you think of one request that I can do? But do not say 'be my lover'.

'''Kazagumo''': Well... (for me to be already treated differently by the Admiral is something, I have to say my thanks to Yuugumo-nee.) Let me think about it later.

'''Hiro''': Okay. By the way, I had a question?

'''Kazagumo''': What is it Admiral?

'''Hiro''': well... Can you cook?

'''Kazagumo''': Well... to be honest...



''Kazagumo ran towards the kitchen and a few minutes later she returned with a tray in her hand.''

'''Sazanami''': Master, she came back.

'''Hiro''': Well...

'''Kazaumo''': Here is my cooking.

As she lift the lid of the tray their faces changed as if they saw Haruna's cooking and Hiei's old cooking.

'''Hiro''': It really looks bad.

'''Sazanami''': I know.

'''Hiro''': But I better taste it.

The Admiral picked one of the unknown food Kazagumo made and put it inside his mouth.
'''Sazanami''': Shall I prepare a instant formula?

'''Hiro''': I don't know... Hmm!!!???

'''Kazagumo''': I know it...

'''Hiro''': How was this possible... It taste great despite looking bad. What is this?

'''Sazanami''': Hmm...!

''Sazanami Picked the food that was in the tray and she put it inside of her mouth and she was surprised to taste something great.''

'''Sazanami''': Wow!!!

'''Kazagumo''': Umm...

'''Hiro''': Well... I guess we can make a little bit of improvements on this, right Sazanami?

'''Sazanami''': Yes Master.

'''Kazagumo''': Thank goodness! I better go now.

Kazagumo left the office.



after Kazagumo left the office, the athmosphere between the two suddenly changed.

'''Hiro''': Haah. It's normal...

'''Sazanami''': At least It's not something that induces a revolution. But how can we make someone bad at presentation be good at cooking?

'''Hiro''': well. I guess having a competent observer would be great.

'''Sazanami''': So, when will you be teaching her?

'''Hiro''': i don't know.

'''Sazanami''': I still hate it that you give her a small request.

'''Hiro''': well...

'''Sazanami''': Are you perhaps hesitating a bit?

'''Hiro''': Kinda. But, I need to push my plans already. It won't be long.

'''Sazanami''': Alright then. I better preapre for our German fishing.

'''Hiro''': Yup. Do your best.

''And the two retire for the night.''


==Off to the future and beyond.==

'''''After the Kazagumo farming, the two were in a daze inside the oofice.'''''

'''Hiro''': Since we got Kazagumo, what should we do now?

'''Sazanami''': I have no idea Master...

'''Hiro''': Well, How about we get Germans?

'''Sazanami''': Are you prepeared mentally?

'''Hiro''': Yup. For as long as I can remember.

'''Sazanami''': Okay. I am with you this time.

'''Hiro''': Good. Please guide them once more.

'''Sazanami''': Okay Master.



''Sazanami Stood up and walks towards the Admiral who was still in a daze. Sazanami then kisses the Admiral to the lips and she said her goodbyes.''

'''Sazanami''': Think of this as my good luck kiss to you, Master.

'''Hiro''': ...

'''Sazanami''': Master, we are going.

'''Hiro''': Take care.

'''Sazanami''': Yup.

''Sazanami smiled and exists the room. The admiral is still feeling embarrased after the kiss.''

'''Hiro''': ... (well... I kinda wanted to take the lead, but for now, I had to be calm and deal with the lots of issues from now on. Let's see... If Tokitsukaze will become a trouble later on I guess I have to let Nowaki and Maikaze handle her instead. And Kashima and Katori should hold each other back until I can find a way to repel the two training cruisers. What worries me is that Maya will attack me and some other candidates that I haven't saw might attack too. I better be on my guard, afterall the annoucement this December 6 will create a lot of troubles.)

'''''And then, the Admiral pulls out his pen and write something in his little notebook.'''''

''P.S. I got U-511 Already. Yay!!!''



==Omake: Why do I even try?==

''A phone call was made to the Naval base.''

'''Kumano '''(other side of the phone): Admiral... Your mom called. I will patch her there.

'''Hiro''': Please do.

'''Kumano '''(other side of the phone): Alright.

'''Hiro''': Hello?

'''H???''': Yo Hiro, It's your most wonderful mom in the world speaking here. You must know why I am speaking to you right now?

'''Hiro''': Yup... Seems like the news travels faster than I thought. How do you managed to get it faster than the other bases despite not being one anyways.

'''H???''': How rude... I am a ship-girl too... by the way, Is it true that you are making a big decision this December?

'''Hiro''': So you knew it too? Who are your spies anyways?

'''H???''': Well Kumano-chan send me letters every week. So it's not a surprise if I get wind of it.

'''Hiro''': Kumano!?

'''H???''': My, so you thought that Kumano is not that sharp of a girl like you thought? You sure like to underestimate women.

'''Hiro''': I see... I am defenseless this time around. So Mom, why did you call, or how did you managed to jack the network?

'''H???''': Well... Being a former ship-girl has it's perks too. I can live longer or you can almost call me an immortal. I can't get sick and I can stay young as I want.

'''Hiro''': Indeed. For the longest time... I thought you are not getting old as I get older.

'''H???''': How unnice of you Hiro. I am your mom afterall.

'''Hiro''': Indeed that's true. So, why are you making this call again. I thought the deal with Anzu is closed and I won that round.

'''H???''': Yup. I was glad to have a cute daughter like her to tke care of me... wait, I better kill Hoshi so she can move here instead.

'''Hiro''': I won't allow it Mom. She needs to be happy.

'''H???''': Buu... Oh well, since Hoshi can't live forever... I can just wait for her to come to my side and decide for her future.

'''Hiro''': Such Wicked methods...

'''H???''': What can I do? You are calling the engagement off and the back-up plan is not working. I am at loss on what to do?

'''Hiro''': How about getting started on a business?

'''H???''': Not that bad, but compared to your dad's cooking... mine can't hold a candle to that.

'''Hiro''': It's true.

'''H???''': So, when will I get to have an interview with Sazanami?

'''Hiro''': Probably at December 7.

'''H???''': Okay. So I guess I can prepare some questions beforehand.

'''Hiro''': ...

'''H???''': By the way, Please see to it that you win this round. If you lose to me this time, better face the consequences.

'''Hiro''': Yup. Looks like everytime I ask some kind of favor from you I need to win with the conditions you set. Say, what was my condition this time?

'''H???''': Since Kino has officially withdrawn the contest and Kumano is the only problem you had at this moment. How about I bet that Kumano will turn bad and tries to injure you gravely. By the way, I'll be watching the battle if that happens.

'''Hiro''': So in the end, If I lost. I got to get tied to Kumano-chan no matter what.

'''H???''': Yes Hiro. Afterall, I know that she has the key to the secrets of the abyssals.

'''Hiro''': So... You are breaking off from the promise you made with dad?

'''H???''': Well, I am not breaking off to that promise. Afterall, He was the only reason why I am speaking to you in this day and age. Your dad is a great guy who commanded us in the battle that happened 120 years ago.

'''Hiro''': I knew that already. So why are you saying that?

'''H???''': Because He cut his arm of to win the fight.

'''Hiro''': !!!

'''H???''': That's why you can't see his left arm in his pictures when you are young. Because he hasn't had that arm anyways.

'''Hiro''': So you mean that there was a hard battle fought that day?

'''H???''': Yes. And to think we were cornered by a Battleship back then was laughable. Well... I guess it's a price to pay to protect the love of his life.

'''Hiro''': I see... Well then, I wanted to say that Yuugumo-san passed. I am kinda sad for her departure.

'''H???''': Its fine. From my calculations, she might get back to the surface. She never hated anyone anyways. So Hiro, better take care of the people you have and do not drag them down to the abyss you have inside of your heart.

'''Hiro''': Yes Mom. So, when will you cook?

'''H???''': If you decide to marry Kumano-chan. I might.

'''Hiro''': Nevermind then.

'''H???''': Wow.  to think you are still in the rebellious phase.  I want to make sure you will work hard.

'''Hiro''': I am used to it. By the way, I gotta go. My fleet secretary is back.

'''H???''': Alright then. I better send you some curry there.

'''Hiro''': No thanks. Your curry is still as bad as always... Mom. I've gotta go.



''The Admiral dropped the line and rest on the chair he is using.''

'''Hiro''': ''[Mom's curry. I better skip that one. I almost died tasting one.]''



'''''- end.'''''
