          To start off, I made this guide with the sole purpose of helping other players find another way to connect to KanColle using Hotspot Shield (HSS), also, because VPN Gate just doesn't like me.

==Installation==

        I am unsure if it is okay to leave links pertaining to pirated content here in this wiki, so instead, I made an Installation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HiRoY--O8A&feature=youtu.be video]  with the link located inside the description box.

[[File:VPN Tutorial-0|thumb|right|335 px]]          The process itself isn't really that hard (it's quite simple really), I made the video as straight to the point and as short as possible like any tutorial video.

        The program is pretty fast and reliable, I don't notice any sluggish response times except when I try to open www.kancolle.wika.com which is pretty weird. Other than that, this is an excellent alternative to VPN Gate (which is a free service by the way and shouldn't really be compared to a paid service like Hotspot Shield Elite).

        Anyway, that is all and I hope installing goes as smoothly as mine did.
