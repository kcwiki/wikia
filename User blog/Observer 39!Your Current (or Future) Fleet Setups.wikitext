Alright, my fellow Teitokus/Shirei-kans, I have a few questions for you all...



Because they're the best in their class, because their voice/design makes you smile, or for any other reason really, which girls do you field most often?

Who would be in your dream fleet(s)? Whether for power, historical significance, or perhaps other reasons.



Basically, who are your favorite ship girls? Either individual ships to a whole class of them, we all have some we will (almost) always go to for some reason or another.



My favorite ships are ones that have made some impact with me, from Inazuma being my starter DD (and my first remodel!) to the way Kuma, Naka, and Haruna speak. 

They include: the entire Akatsuki class of DDs, both Fusou-Class BBVs, Natori, Kuma, Ushio, Shouhou, and probably a few others too...just realized I tend to like the nervous or understanding types, eh heh.



My dream fleet I'm building is what I've dubbed the "Lucky" fleet (運艦隊). Those ships who, for one reason or another, have high luck stats, regardless of anything else (the highest currently in game, in fact).

They are: Shigure, Yukikaze, Hiryuu, Zuihou, Zuikaku, and I-58 (Gouya). 

So I ask again, who are your favorites amongst all these girls and ladies?
