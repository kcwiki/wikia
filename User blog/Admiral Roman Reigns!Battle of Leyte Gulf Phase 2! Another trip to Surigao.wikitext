Docks

You know what to do girls, scout out Surigao and look for intel regarding taking down the Abyssals up North

Another trip at Surigao..(Yamashiro)

This time, we should be fortunate enough (Fusou)

I'm sure after this, we could rest and let Kurita fleet handle the rest..(Mogami)

You better reward me after this Admiral I'm now at a equal level to join the big battles.. (Michisio)

       "sigh* Another trip to be depth charged...beats doing Orel (I-14)

       "light laughter*... (Shigure)

Shigure? (Yamashiro)

I'm just happy now... we're together, and doing this mission again, without fear and trauma from the past... (Shigure)

I agree with that...if only Yamagumo and Asagumo we're with us (Fuso)

Forgive me if I hadn't leveled Asagumo or saved a slot for Yamagumo.. - (Admiral)

Then buy slots you greedy cheap baka..(Michisio)

But, considering the air-raids will happen, a good alternative will join you. (looks at White haired Ducky) no problems will arise in this map considering the ordeal that happen before.. (Admiral)

(shakes head as no) I won't be a burden. I assure we will come home... (Suzutsuki) 





Nishimura fleet, and Iyo then gather to Suzutsuki. Shigure gives a reassuring look at her.





So girls, lets give Kurita fleet the opening they need. I'll join with Kurita as they are gonna do skirmish missions...
