Oh God. What can I say about this map? That it was hard as hell, even in easy mode? That I'm having a better time in E-6? That this map was the most mind bogglingly mind numbing and sanity draining that I've experienced this far? For alot of people, E-5 was difficult, yes, but not undoable. Well, after spending the bulk of my resources getting stopped E node after E node, I can, for sure, say that I might not have cleared this map. Some might say "your ships weren't leveled" or "not the right equipment", but I say to you, nuts! (good one if you get the reference)
