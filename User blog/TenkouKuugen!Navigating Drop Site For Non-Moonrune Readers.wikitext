HiHi!

Today I'll briefly explain how to find drop information on [https://db.kcwiki.moe/drop/ Poi-Statistics].

TTKs who can't read moonrunes have to ask for help on forums, but sometimes the reply doesn't come quick enough for the decision at hand. Wish you can find what you need right this moment? No worries! It's easier than you think.
==Site Layout (Poi Statistics)==
First we need to familiarise with the layout of the site.  By visiting https://db.kcwiki.moe/drop/ you are greeted with a screen like this:

The top row switches between different stats. A lot of people don't know that Poi also tracks crafting results and it is a good alternative to [http://www.kancolle-db.net/ KanColleDB] if you want a 2nd opinion.

In the next section, the stats are arranged by Maps. Clicking on a World brings up individual maps for selection, from which the tracked drop stats for each '''Node''' can be examined. This is useful if you're aiming to farm a particular node for 1 ship, but also curious about what else you can get.

In the last section, the stats for each individual kanmusu can be called up: which map/node, Rank required, HQ Lv and % etc. This is probably what most people are interested in so we'll take a further look.

==Finding The Right Kanmusu==
You may think "OMG moonrunes! I can't read them!" but luckily you don't need to. What you need is a reference (eg Wikia) and your browser's search function (Ctrl+F).

Before we go further, I hope that you've had a good look at the site layout and comments posted above. Poi apparently uses Chinese:Simplified on part of the site, which is different from Japanese kanji, ie Ctrl+F may not work for some items eg Ship Class. That's why it's important to familiarise yourself with the layouts.

Now for example, if you wanna look up stats for '''shimakaze''':

First look up Shimakaze on Wikia. Copy the kanji "島風" then do a search on Poi:

Well that wasn't too hard was it? :)

Clicking on it brings up detailed report on where to get her.

==Further Readings==
This is intended to be a very brief guide on how to navigate the site. For more detailed discussions see the following:

==Remarks==
This search technique can be applied to Poi's crafting section too.  Just copy-paste the reference kanji and you're set.
