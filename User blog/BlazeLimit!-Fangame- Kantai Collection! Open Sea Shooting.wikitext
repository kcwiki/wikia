Wow, I'm not used to typing on a wikia at all XD

Well, uuuh, thanks for stopping by! So let me tell you about this game I'm making.

What I'm essentially doing is translating KanColle into a side scrolling shooter. Of course there'll be some differences, but for the most part its set up just like the original. I suppose the best way to tell you about it would be to show some gameplay.
