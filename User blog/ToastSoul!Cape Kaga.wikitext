'''Cape Kaga / kaga misaki / 加賀岬'''

[[File:CL8sLFrUsAA7FTE.jpg|thumb|centre|400px]]

 '''English'''

 The ''fukusa'' gathered in these hands, the colour vermilion
 If I open these eyes and gaze at that face
 Rest these wings and we will overcome the stormy seas

 If our fingers would intertwine and you would hold me close
 Then I will not fear even the blazing ocean
 Release these wings and advance into the sky of battles

 You and I, if we shoot these arrows, yes
 The hazy moonlit night is beautiful, isn't it

 In the battle of this night
 Unable to swallow my pride I shall not give in
 Such is the heart of a woman

 This single feeling I hold close to my chest
 I am fine just this way
 So long as my heart will remain

 Face the ocean, this one wish
 This is the pride of a million ''koku''
 Cape Kaga

 The gloves these fingers touched remain warm
 If I leave this heart and look ahead
 Fold these wings, face port and return home

 Despite this killing sentiment
 I do not wish to show the weakness in my heart
 The young cranes too run towards the sea of battles

 The first arrow, the second arrow, if we shoot these arrows, yes
 It would be so simple, however

 In this battle
 I cannot let my guard down, I should not be able
 Such is the heart of a woman

 This single feeling I hold close to my chest
 I am fine just this way
 So long as something will remain 

 Face Mount Akagi, this one wish
 These are the prayers of a million ''koku''
 Cape Kaga

 You and I, if we would shoot these arrows, see
 The falling sakura are beautiful, aren't they

 In the battle of this night too
 Unable to swallow my pride I should not be able to back down 
 Such is the heart of a woman

 This single feeling I hold close to my chest
 I am fine just this way
 So long as my heart will remain

 I cannot forget this one feeling
 Such is the pride of a million ''koku''
 Cape Kaga

 '''Japanese'''

 この手によせる　袱紗　朱の色
 この目ひらいて　その顔見れば
 翼束ねて　波濤を超えて　あげる

 指を絡めて　抱きしめたなら
 炎のうみも怖くはないの
 翼を放ち　戦の空へ　駆ける

 私とあなた　射掛ければ　そう
 朧月夜が　きれいね

 今夜の勝負は
 退くに退けない　譲れはしない
 女心よ　ねえ

 胸秘めた　想い一つ
 いいのよ　このまま
 心が残るのなら

 海向かい　願い一つ
 百万石の
 誇りよ　加賀岬

 この指ふれた　ゆがけ　温もり
 心残して　その先見れば
 翼畳んで　港に向かい　還る

 見敵必殺　心情なれど
 心の隙も　見せたくないの
 若鶴達も　戦の海へ　疾しる

 一の矢二の矢　射掛ければ　そう
 鎧袖一触　けれども

 今度の勝負は
 油断　できない　できるはずない
 女心よ　ねえ

 胸秘めた　想い一つ
 いいのよ　このまま
 何かが残るのなら

 赤城の山に　願い一つ
 百万石の
 祈りよ　加賀岬

 私とあなた　射掛ければ　ほら
 桜吹雪が　きれいね

 今夜の勝負も
 退くに　退けない　退けるはずない
 女心よ　ねえ

 胸秘めた　願い一つ
 いいのよ　このまま
 心が残るのなら

 忘れない　想い一つ
 百万石の
 誇りよ　加賀岬



Notes: 

'''There are now two other translations in the comment section! Check 'em out if you want to expand your palate for Cape Kaga lyrics.'''

Although currently googling Cape Kaga in EN/JP ends up bring up nothing but this song, it does seem like Cape Kaga may have been an actual place in Kahoku of Ishikawa Prefecture. [https://twitter.com/ryusan_SLB/status/625642223762157568 source]
'''More on this in the comments.'''

I don't know if the Japanese lyrics are completely correct, but here's the first bit of Cape Kaga. I don't know enka at all, but I imagine Kaga to be standing by herself on a cape facing out towards a sunset whenever I hear this.

wings - As with the other Kancolle character songs, it's most likely that 'wings' refer to planes here.

The hazy moonlit night is beautiful - Not sure how related this is, but this initially reminded me of 月が綺麗ですね (The moon is beautiful, isn't it), famously translated as 'I love you' by novelist Natsume Sōseki.

young cranes - Zuikaku and Shoukaku.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_(geography) Cape] - As in a bit of land that sticks out into the ocean, not something superheroes wear.

''fukusa'' - A type of Japanese cloth thing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukusa

The colour vermilion - Red-coloured ''fukusa'' are generally used in celebrations, it seems

shoot these arrows - Specifically refers to shooting at an enemy

''koku'' - Traditionally a measurement of rice, enough to feed a person for a year. May have an actual slight relation to Kaga, based on [https://www.hot-ishikawa.jp/english/attraction/history/index.html this]. Apparently she gets her name from the area or something.
'''More on this in the comments.'''

gloves - Actually refers to gloves used for archery. https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%86%E3%81%8C%E3%81%91

killing sentiment - Full line is actually something more along the lines of 'kill enemy on sight, despite these feelings', but I really have no idea how to interpret this. Love=War there she wants to completely murder her enemies and win the man, but she isn't? I dunno, kinda fits with the last few lines where 'should' comes into play.

weakness in my heart - Something like 'cracks in the guard of my heart', so it's probably AI YO, MADOKA

falling sakura - SAKURA BLIZZARDDDDDDD!!!

The first arrow, the second arrow - The specific way it's read probably refers less to the literal meaning and more to plans and follow-up plans... Probably.
