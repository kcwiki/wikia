I've been running the idea for a fan fiction through my head for quite some time now but I'm not sure exactly about how to put into writing. It would be kind of based on my personal experience playing the game and a little bit of creative liberty that would kind of break the confines and constraints of the source material(aka the Game itself) would be used. I'm not the best writer in the world and I'm a little worried I won't be able to do justice to the both the game and the characters. If you have any thoughts, opinions or ideas on how I should go about doing this my fellow admirals, please do reply in the comments.
