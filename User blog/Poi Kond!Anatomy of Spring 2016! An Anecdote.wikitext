It all seemed well. I'd planned ahead and paced myself, but it was still all for naught.  All I can say is just fuck this event. I need to go apologize to my resource reserves now.

== The Maps ==
Actually not that bad. Thank flaukorv for the three WG42's from god knows how long ago.  Of course, I did pussy out and do Easy on most, but they went by really fast. Like, 10 min. fast for some. Except E7. Never forget, never forgive. I never want to see 中姫 again. eugh. 

== The Waifus ==
Top waifus and top letdowns, where to begin. All of this is from E7, drenched in salty tears.

MVP:  [[Kongou|Kongou-bongo]] really came through E7 last dance, fucked [[Central Princess - Damaged|中姫]]'s asshole.[[File:CL_Ooyodo_Kai_321_Battle.jpg|thumb]] Gonna have to put a ring on her now.   




Letdowns: I really thought that 2 WG42's would drop fools, and it did. Just the wrong fools. Ooyodo'd never fail to sink... any ship but the boss during yasen. eugh RNG wai.

Myself: A lack of planning on E7 was truly my downfall. Last dance was 12 runs of poor decisions and tiny mistakes that would leave <span style="font-weight:normal;">中姫 at a sliver of HP after yasen, but never sunk. Happy I got Iowa, but this event was really a full-course meal of humble pie.</span>

== Closing ==
This event was still overall a whirlwind of fun, and it made me excited and nervous abotu the game's future. The false confidence I got as a high HQ returnee was quickly replaced by despair and regret as I learned to deal with new mechanics and metagame. At least hopefully we don't see the crass that is <span style="font-weight:normal;">中姫 Damaged this summer. Come to think of it, there probably won't be-- it'll be even worse ;_;</span>

The Good:

*Didn't run out of buckets! ≧∇≦)/
*Got Teruzuki!
*Actually cleared the event
*Iowa.
*A myriad of other drops that I didn't think I would get
The Bad:
*Literally no resources left[[File:TKNPSpring2k16.png|thumb]]
*Iowa.
*Self-loathing
*Literally no resources left
*Despair
