==List of important ships to level==

This section is of help for especially newer players to decide what ships they shall prioritize in leveling. For the most part it will cover ships that are relatively easy to aquire and every player can get outside of events.

| style="width: 60px;" |
[[Yuudachi]]
|style="background:LawnGreen "|
high
|
Yuudachi is by far the best combat destroyer in the game, must have

|-
|[[Arare]]
|style="background:Khaki "|medium
|
Arare has decent combat stats, decent armor, can equip daihatsus and on top has very high ASW stat, best allround destroyer fitting for almost every job.

'''Kai Ni requires blueprint'''

As alternative you can use [[Ooshio]],[[Arashio|&nbsp;Arashio]], [[Asashio|Asashio.]] All of them except Asashio require a blueprint.

|-
|[[Kasumi]]
|style="background:Khaki "|medium
|Kasumi has high combat stats and high luck capable of using Torpedo-Cutin Setup. She can also equip Fleet Command Facility and Large Radars(in Kai Ni B) and perform special Anti-Air-Cutin
|-
|

[[Shigure]]
|style="background:LightPink"|lower
|
Shigure has good combat stats, high Luck and high ASW

Alternatively [[Ayanami]] has even better stats, high luck but lower ASW

[[Abukuma]]
|style="background:LawnGreen "|
high
|
Abukuma Kai Ni can perform opening torpedo strike which is insanely valuable on a CL. On top she can equip Daihatsus,has good combat stats and high ASW Absolute must have

'''Kai Ni requires Blueprint'''
|-
|[[Sendai]]
|style="background:LawnGreen "|
high
|Sendai is an average CL in stats but one item she brings with Kai Ni is very important:[[Type 98 Reconnaissance Seaplane (Night Recon)| Type 98 Reconnaissance Seaplane (Night Recon)]]
|-
|[[Ooyodo]]
|style="background:Khaki "|medium
|Ooyodo is relatively hard to obtain early but one of the most important CL. She comes with unique powerful Equipment([[Fleet Command Facility]]) and is one of very few CL with 4 equipment slots making powerful setups possible(4 ASW items,Anti-Installation setup, night-battle item mule)
|-
|[[Isuzu]]
|style="background:Khaki "|medium
|Isuzu can perform a preemptive antisubmarine-strike regardless of her ASW stat. Therefore she is the best choice fighting submarines early on.
|-
|
[[Yura]]
|style="background:LightPink"|lower
|
Yura can also perform an opening torpedo strike but weaker than Abukuma in both firepower and torpedo stat. She is one of few CL that can equip seaplane fighter/bomber,equip daihatsus and can use some secondary gun in her epxansion slot.

'''Kai Ni requires Blueprint'''

Alternatively [[Tama]] can also equip seaplane fighter/bomber. She has better combat stats than Yura and can equip daihatsus among other things but cannnot perform an opening torpedo strike. Tama Kai Ni requires a Blueprint as well.
|-
|[[Jintsuu]]
|style="background:LightPink"|lower
|Jintsuu has the highest firepower/torpedostat of all CL

===Torpedo Cruiser:===

! scope="col"|Explanation
|-
| style="width: 60px;" |
[[Kitakami]]
|style="background:LawnGreen "|
high
|
Torpedo Cruisers are a must have and Kitakami is the best of them.Main strengths are strong opening torpedo, insane nightbattle double attack or torpedo-cutin

|-
|[[Ooi]]
|style="background:Khaki "|medium
|Ooi is the second best Torpedo Cruiser only lacking in luck stat and therefore not suited for torpedo-cutin setup.
|}
===Heavy Cruiser:===
{| style="width: 500px;" class="article-table" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1"
|-

|-
| style="width: 60px;" |
[[Myoukou]]
|style="background:Khaki "|
medium
|
Very high combat stats and one of very few CA with high luck.

Alternatively you can go with any other Myoukou-class ship.

|-
|[[Maya]]
|style="background:LightPink"|lower
|Maya can perform a powerful Anti-Air-Cutin only rivaled by the Akizuki-class DDs who are much harder to obtain and therefore not separetely mentioned in this list
|}
===Aviation Cruiser:===

{| style="width: 500px;" class="article-table" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1"

[[Ise]]
|style="background:Khaki "|
medium
|
5 equipment slots, only BB that can equip fighters and bombers.

'''Kai Ni requires 2 Blueprints, 1 Prototype Flight Deck Catapult, 1 Action Report'''
|-
|Kongou-class
|style="background:Khaki "|medium
|Of course your fleet needs some FastBB. But most of them are similarly good, therefore the recommendation is to level the easisest to obtain Kongou-Class. Note that BB are very easy to level and don't need much attention.
|}
===Carrier and Light Carrier:===

{| style="width: 500px;" class="article-table" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1"
|-
! scope="col"|Name
! scope="col"|Priority
! scope="col"|Explanation
|-
| style="width: 60px;" |
[[Zuikaku]], [[Shoukaku]]
|style="background:LawnGreen "|
high
|
Very good combat stats, high armor, can attack while medium damaged, can equip Jets. Some quests that reward powerful items require Zuikaku,Shoukaku. Must have

'''Kai Ni requiresÂ  Blueprint and Prototype Flight Deck Catapult'''
|-
|[[Zuihou]]
|style="background:Khaki "|medium
|
The advantage over most other CVL is that Zuihou can join a Transport Escort Fleet and that can perform an easy ASW attack.

Alternatively but with less features you can level up [https://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Ryuujou_Kai Ryuujou]
|-
|
[[Hiryuu]],

[[Souryuu]]
|style="background:LightPink"|lower
|Hiryuu and Souryuu are easier to upgrade to their last remodellevel and while still very good not on the same powerlevel as Shoukaku-class. However they bring very powerful carrier equipment with their Kai Ni as a bonus.

===Other Ship Types:===

{| style="width: 500px;" class="article-table" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1"

| style="width: 60px;" |
[[Akashi]]
|style="background:LawnGreen "|
high
|
Akashi is relatively hard to obtain but the reward is big.

Askashi can repair your lightly damaged ships and you get access to [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] where you can upgrade items which is a huge advancement to every admiral. You only need to level Akashi to 35.
|-
|
[[Chiyoda]],

[[Chitose]]
|style="background:LightPink"|lower
|Chiyoda and Chitose are by far the easieast to obtain Seaplane Tender. In some quests you need this special shipclass and on some maps they provide better routing. Chiyoda and Chitose remodel into CVL later on, be careful if you want to convert or keep them as AV.
