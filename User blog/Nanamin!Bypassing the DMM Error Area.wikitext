You may implement the above fix by manually running the below in your console:

  document.cookie = "cklg=welcome;expires=Sun, 09 Feb 2019 09:00:09 GMT;domain=dmm.com;path=/"
  document.cookie = "ckcy=1;expires=Sun, 09 Feb 2019 09:00:09 GMT;domain=dmm.com;path=/netgame/"
  document.cookie = "ckcy=1;expires=Sun, 09 Feb 2019 09:00:09 GMT;domain=dmm.com;path=/netgame_s/"

However, this requires it be run -every single page- unless you're persisting the cookies with EditThisCookie (linked below).

==Original Post==

So quite recently (like within the last day or two?), DMM changed something and a lot of people are getting the error area problem, the one where "This service is not available in your country" shows up. I looked into it and found that the issue was that the "ckcy" cookie now updates whenever you reload a page. Here's how I got around that:

<div style="color: red;">Please do note that this method is for Google Chrome. I don't use the other browsers, so I don't know their specifics, but they should be capable of something similar to this.</div>

'''Before you attempt this, you should see if you can use the shorter method of simply going straight to the game URL. Click here: http://www.dmm.com/netgame/social/-/gadgets/=/app_id=854854/.'''

Step 1:

Download this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en.

Step 2: Navigate to DMM's homepage: http://www.dmm.com/.

Step 3: Open EditThisCookie's popup window and find "ckcy" in the list. Its value at this time should be "2".

Step 4: Change the value to "1" and hit the checkmark at the bottom of the popup window.

Step 5: Open "ckcy" again in the list and click the lock symbol to the left of the textboxes.

Step 6: Do the same thing for "cklg". The value to use is "welcome" or some other random string.

That should fix it. If you have any issues, feel free to comment them below.

If you want to try the other random stuff I did in case it might help, I ran the following in the console:
