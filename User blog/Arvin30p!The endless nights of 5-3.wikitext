The night is long<br />the night is hard<br />the night is your ally<br />the night is your foe<br />I'll never comprehend<br />How hard a night combat would be.


and so I wish<br />while my luck is with me<br />Help me find a way<br />to finish an endless night.<br />and let me see the sun<br />Oh, the nights in Solomon<br />I wish it could end now.



The long nights, The short days<br />how I wish there's an end in sight.<br />And now I close my eyes<br />andÂ  by tomorrow I could find<br />a way to break,<br />this long, tiring, endless nights.
