So, I've finished the first "Assemble the Mutsuki-Class (Gen-1)" or something along those lines (I know it's something like "DesDiv 27" or something), and frankly, it was painful. The Mutsukis are just too weak. I had to put DameCon's on Mutsuki and Kisaragi, the two I want to level, and had to put turbines on Mochizuki and Yayoi, leaving Isuzu and Shigure to make a B rank. Then I need Uzuki. But, contrary to everyone else, I can't find her. I've been running 1-5, 2-5, and 3-5 in effort to get her, but RNG just isn't putting up with me. Maybe it intends to punish me for finding Isokaze back during the Pike Mackerel event. Whatever. Anyways, it's a pain, but I'l get there someday. (add obligatory hype for Iowa)
