Reinforcement Expansions are a consumable item that when used unlocks an extra slot with limited capabilities. Depending on the ship these capabilities vary due to general ability to equip items such as anti-torpedo bulges. Additionally some ships can equip secondary guns in their expansion slot. The functionality of any item used in the expansion slot is the same as it would be in a regular slot. This means that AACI setups and Nightbattle Attack types will be affected by what is equipped. Accordingly somme ships can make more use of it and some less.

The following is to break down what use a given ship can make of an expansion
====General Ideas applicable to everyone====
*the more frequently a ship tends to be used, the more useful an expansion becomes (EOs, Events)
*bulges can be used for extra survivability on heavier ships
*AAMGs can be used to increase AA capabilities
*Turbines can be used to get ships to a higher speed in combination with a Boiler
*Emergency Repair Personnel/Godess
====Maya====
*enables using her strongest AACI with 2 free slots for combining AACI with Artillery Spotting or TCI
====CV(L/B) in general====
*can make use of the [[12cm_30-tube_Rocket_Launcher_Kai_Ni|Rocket Launcher K2]] mechanic
*inability to attack at Chuuha and Taiha HP can make great use of extra survivability with extra armor
====CVB, Saratoga CVN====
*tend to be the best in their position due to their unique abilities and are used very often as a result
====Suzuya/Kumano====
*have the ability to equip 8cm secondary guns in their expansions for Yasen DA + 3 slots
*very strong Anti-Installation usability
*room for more planes
====Yura/Ooyodo/Agano-class====
*similar to Suzuya and Kumano (10cm secondary for Ooyodo)
====Nelson/Warspite/Kongou-class====
*adds AACI capability when combining [[16inch_Mk.I_Triple_Gun_Mount_Kai_%2B_FCR_Type_284|16inch+FCR]] and a british AAMG with otherwise regular gear setups
====Musashi/Ise-class====
*AACI when combining Rocket Launcher K2al and an Air Radar
*Musashi can equip 10cm secondary in her expansion slot allowing various utility setups
====BBV/AV/CAV====
*can make use of the [[12cm_30-tube_Rocket_Launcher_Kai_Ni|Rocket Launcher K2]] mechanic

*loosely based on this chart
*if a ship from the table was not listed, then the General Ideas are all there is to them
*keep in mind that just because you can use something, doesnt mean you should
