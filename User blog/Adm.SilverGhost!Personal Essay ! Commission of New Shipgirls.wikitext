As our game that we playing is names as "Kantai(Fleet) Collection", one of the main contents is to collecting the shipgirls with extraordinary appearances and personalities.

I do love it, so I always try to keep my dicipline of playstyle that way.

But there was one big moster standing on my way; My naive mind.

This got me in for too long that made me to bear big wound since 2 years ago.

For example, last event of [Winter 2018 Event], I got Iowa the battleship as dissolving my 21-month-old desire. This one is a bit tricky and dramatic...

[[File:KanColle-20180318-10284484.png|thumb|left|400px|Commission of Iowa, my 21-month-old wound has been stitched.]]Actually I missed her 2 years ago. When I was at the [Spring 2016 Event], which was so soaring incident to me because I couldn't clear all stages and get Iowa.

Now I recall of it, I was way too naive and unprepared for event .

So that I started to prepare with great readiness for 21 monthes. I wrote "Fleet Diary" for everyday to manage my fleet to be stronger. Additionally, I adopted SWOT analysis onto my fleet and tried to know each strength, weakness, opportunity, threat for all sides.

At last, maybe god helped my luck. I got her in Winter 2018 Event despite of its devastating drop rate.

Yes, I got her, "Iowa the Glorious Battleship of United States" in 10:28 of 18th, March of 2018(Commission No. 17530). Hell yeah!

And today, I just got Samuel D. Roberts(Commission No. 18285) via completing all of 5 quests(Which also the reason of me to type this essay).[[File:KanColle-180512-23381714.png|thumb|400px|Commissioned in 23:38, 12th, May, 2018. "Welcome aboard, adorable dear one."]]

Of course many people would think;

"Is that really big triumph to be mentioned?"

But at least for me, I can tell that "I'm not really trying type of man".

I can say that I'm totally defensive person rather than enjoying challenges or bashing into hard jobs(Just as the evidence of it, I still have no First Class Medals).

So that I can tell; it was rarely aggressive playstyle that I tried to get Sammy via succeeding all of 5 quests.

As now, reminding what I've done to rescue Sammy, I feel proud of myself to rescue and commission her into my fleet.

In conclusion, now I thinking of getting new shipgirls and rescuing them, the keys to achieving it was 3 things.

1. Great desire to get the shipgirls - the "Motivation"

2. Courage to get over my defensive mind - the "Bravery"

3. Persisting trial to be "Combat-Ready" - the "Readiness"

Today's occurance gave me such big lessons for me. Now I see I got first and third lessons, yet feeling in lack of second one.

Maybe I'm still far to be a good teitoku, I think... I shall sharpen my mind better.
