==Overview==
Most people have been told that ASW stat has little impact on ASW damage, while equipment makes a significant difference. However, ASW is a little complicated to calculate. Therefore, in this blog I will quickly discuss how ASW is calculated and recommended set-ups. This is important since [[Submarine Princess]] has appeared in two consecutive events and will undoubtedly continue to appear in the future.

==Definitions==
According to our [[combat]] page, ASW is calculated by:

{| class="article-table article-table-selected" style="width:754px;" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"|-
|Anti-sub warfare
|(2 <span style="font-weight:normal;">×</span> √(Ship ASW) + 1.5 <span style="font-weight:normal;">×</span> Equipment ASW + ASW Upgrades + Type) <span style="font-weight:normal;">×</span> Bonus
|Equipment ASW: Does not apply to ASW from Recon Seaplanes.<br />Type: 13 if Sonar/Depth Charge (DD, CL), 8 if aircraft (AV, CVL, CAV, BBV).<br />Bonus: 1.15 if both Sonar and Depth Charge are equipped, 1.0 otherwise.
|}

ASW Daytime Cap is 100<ref>Source: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_Calculation#Attack_Power_Cap</ref>

Head-on has a damage modifier of .8 while Parallel has a damage modifier of 1.<ref> Source: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Engagement_Form_Modifier </ref>

Line Abreast and the ASW Formation in combined fleet has an ASW modifier of 1.3 <ref> Source: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Formation_Modifier</ref> <ref> Source: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combined_Fleet#Fleet_Formations </ref>

Sonar and Depth Charge upgrades add √(★) ASW.<ref> Source: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Akashi's_Improvement_Arsenal</ref>

To simplify calculations, I will use 64 as the base ship ASW.

==3-Slot Calculations==
Surprisingly, ASW cap is easy to reach in Parallel but very difficult to reach in Head-on.

For example, assuming you have a 3-Slot DD/CL with 2 [[Type 3 Active Sonar]]s and 1 [[Type 3 Depth Charge Projector]]:
{{{!}} border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="article-table" style="width: 500px;"
{{!}}-

! scope="col"{{!}}Slot 1

{{!}}{{EquipmentCardKai|Type 3 Active Sonar|size=160px}}
{{!}}{{EquipmentCardKai|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|size=160px}}
{{!}}'''Locked'''
{{!}}}

ASW Pre-cap in Parallel: [2*√(64) (ship ASW) + 1.5*28 (equipment) + 0 (upgrades) + 13 (type)] * 1.15 (dc+sonar) * 1.3 (line abreast) = 106.145

ASW Pre-cap in Head-on: [2*√(64) (ship ASW) + 1.5*28 (equipment) + 0 (upgrades) + 13 (type)] * 1.15 (dc+sonar) * 1.3 (line abreast) * .8 (head-on) = 84.916.

Even max modded equipment would only add 9.48 ASW, summing to 94.4 ASW. Therefore to reach ASW cap in head-on, we need to use modded [[Type 4 Passive Sonar]]s.

{{!}}{{EquipmentCardKai|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|size=160px}}6★
{{!}}'''Locked'''
{{!}}}

ASW Pre-cap in Head-on: [2*√(64) (ship ASW) + 1.5*32 (equipment) + 7 (upgrades) + 13 (type)] * 1.15 (dc+sonar) * 1.3 (line abreast) * .8 (head-on) = 100.464

==4-Slot Calculations==
A 4th slot is extremely powerful because it adds a significant amount of ASW. In fact, 4 slot ASW ships can hit head-on ASW cap fairly easily.

For example, assuming you have a 4-Slot CL/CT with 3 [[Type 3 Active Sonar]]s and 1 [[Type 3 Depth Charge Projector]]:
{{{!}} border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="article-table" style="width: 500px;"
{{!}}-

{{!}}{{EquipmentCardKai|Type 3 Active Sonar|size=160px}}
{{!}}{{EquipmentCardKai|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|size=160px}}
{{!}}}

ASW Pre-cap in Head-on: [2*√(64) (ship ASW) + 1.5*38 (equipment) + 0 (upgrades) + 13 (type)] * 1.15 (dc+sonar) * 1.3 (line abreast) * .8 (head-on) = 102.856

Unfortunately, because Ooyodo has terrible ASW stats, she actually requires a single star on two equips to hit head-on ASW cap.

==Conclusion==
Since almost, if not all, ASW focused maps allow saiun, our goal should be to hit ASW cap in head-on. By using the recommended equipment set-ups, we can reach this goal and improve our chances in difficult ASW maps

==Notes==
*Sonars should be upgraded before depth charges because they increase survivability against torps.
*It is very important to use T3 sonars for 4-slot ASW ships, because they increase acc which is important against [[Submarine Princess]]


==Thanks==
*Thanks to Hayashi for mentioning Combined Fleet ASW mod is also 1.3 and that T3 Sonars are preferred on 4-slot ships for acc.
