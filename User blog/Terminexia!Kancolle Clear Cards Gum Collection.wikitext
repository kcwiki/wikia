Just recently, I stumbled across this set of what looks like a booster box of Kancolle cards at a local hobby shop I frequent. Since I can't read moonrunes, I decided to buy a box and a few singles to see exactly what it is.

So in each box, there are 16 packs, each with 2 clear plastic cards and a pack of gum(no idea what it tastes like. Brain refuses to register it.).

Each of the different types of ships have their very own background, which I thought was kinda cool.

with the damaged artwork. Aside from the obvious differences in 

art, these cards have their name and damage quotes in gold.

I managed to get 3 from my box and another 4+1 repeat from the single packs, so actually, I have no idea how rare they're supposed to be.
For a limited time(I think), each box also comes with 1 "special" card. Nagara, Isuzu and Natori. I got Nagara.




And if you've noticed, the clear effect of the cards goes really well with any card sleeves with a silver backing. The silver backing of the card sleeves gives it a nice "foil" effect. The one I'm using would be from the Bushiroad HG Series of card sleeves.




Anyway, for this set, they only have 69+12 damaged artwork to collect. But from what I've seen on the net, ensky will be releasing another set which will have 72+14 Damaged, probably the ones they have yet to release.
