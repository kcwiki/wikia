Hello here is satori rock to report of this passage through the summer event this year (actually recently started to get just this year with the issue of the events as though I am now level 88 I'm still a NOBB in many ways ) whatever as it is trying to be a rough log of what will this event.

{{Fleet|CL|DD|DD|DD|DD|DD|Route = A - D - Z}}



Mode: Medium

Fleet Composition : Cl - DD - DD - DD - DD - DD

Route : A - D - Z

Total Runs : 5

Although it was easier map with the use of Cvl or CA or unfortunately for me after seeing the rules of other maps that I lacked enough level ships l and because of that I decided to complicate a little in the first maps for loo least make others in Medium Difficulty. The basic Basic training was made based on 1 CL to 5 DD that included Naka, Hibiki, Shiroyuki, Mutsuki, Yayoi, Murasame, in his maximum stats In the first 4 runs a used a Hibiki but he is level up in the four run and starter to send to F-G route and  A - B - D - Z leaving my ships on critical situation and instead to change for CA or Batleship ( because i dont have a suficent level ships for anothers maps ) i try to change with another Cl, Tatsuta in this case but another time send me to A - B - Z - D Route. Finally put Ushio and send me A-D-Z route again and in two run kill the boss without problems.
