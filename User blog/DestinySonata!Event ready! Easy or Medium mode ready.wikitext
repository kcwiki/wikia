It's been a while ever since I asked if I was ready for the event. I've been quite anxious since I've only started a little over a month ago and this is going to be my first event.

I've been really grinding a lot these past few weeks, so I think I'm getting near to getting ready for the event. I'm missing a few ships here and there, but generally, I'm happy with my progress.Â 

I don't plan to stop grinding though. Which leads me to the question, am I ready? If I can choose a difficulty, I'd probably choose Easy, unless there's some event ships only for the higher difficulties (by this I mean like if you clear E-5 you get this certain ship only if you clear it in hard).

* People keep telling me to use Ooi. Problem is, I don't have Ooi.

** I have a lot of SS, but only of these two. All of them are non-kai and around level 30 - 40.

For equipment I just get what I get when I K2 my ships. I don't craft equipment at all due to the fact I allot my resources to either grinding or crafting new ships.
