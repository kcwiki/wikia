''"Long time ago, they waited for us and strike us with all of their might... Now it is us who shall wait and bring the arrows of fury unto them."'' - Hiryu

It was a long wait. Everyone that was on duty before knew how hectic that day was. Yet still, even the ones that serve long in my fleet was anxious to see that place that led the turning-point in the Pacific.

Still despite my confidence to ensure that the alien fleet is remove and reclaim control in the seas, we knew how this is going be bad if we are not be careful.

Henceforth, I will use every Kanmusu available for combat depending on the situation arises.

'''The review''':
According to small info my fellow admirals had gathered, a majority of the alien fleet is gathering towards Midway Island, which has been used as refueling station for aircraft, seaplanes as well submarines.
So, I had to set sail a fleet to the Northern Waters to recapture Attu and Kiska Islands as well as performing an aerial attack/bombardment on Dutch Harbor. If successful, we may able to lure some of the enemy force there. At the same time another fleet will head to Midway Island and remove any alien ship that was there.

Of course it is not going to be easy. As we expect a strong Task Force will await for us.
