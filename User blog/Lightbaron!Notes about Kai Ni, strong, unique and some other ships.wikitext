= <u>Introduction</u> =
<br />
Some time ago someone I know from another game who started with KanColle asked which girls are good to have and to level. Most of the guides I've read up to now are quite long or only focus on the important ships while ignoring the less important but still decent ships.<br />

My answer to that question was a .txt file with notes to many ships, which I put together in ~3 hours. This is a reworked and updated version of those notes. I tried to keep it as short and on point as possible for each ship. Therefore it is nothing as fancy as a leveling guide but simply a help for deciding which ships to level next.<br />

I took most of the Kai Ni ships, strong Kai ships, unique ships and ships which require blueprints and put them into 3 groups for most ship types based on multiple factors such as their performance, accessibility and special traits they might have.<br />
In some cases I included both Kai and Kai Ni forms and for ship types with a low total number of ships I included all of them.<br />

•The first group includes mainly outstanding ships of their type, which can be obtained without major problems or those that have a special role and are important to obtain for said role.<br />
•The second group includes good or mediocre ships, outstanding ships which are hard to obtain or require Blueprints/Action Reports but aren't a priority, only appear during events or in LSC or comparably weak ships which come with a trait that makes them strong in limited situations.<br />
•The third group includes ships that are comparably weak, have special traits that can also be performed by ships easier accessible or didn't make another appearance after the event they were introduced in.<br />
•CTs, CVBs & Other Ship Types are ungrouped and CLTs & BBVs are only split in 2 groups.<br />
•The groups are all sorted by alphabet.<br />
<br />
