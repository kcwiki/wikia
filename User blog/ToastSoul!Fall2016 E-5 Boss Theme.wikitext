It's only four lines, but still people can't agree on what she's saying

 '''Japanese ''(copied from niconico)'''''

 溶けて　壊れ　燃え堕ちゆくの
 あなたの　声を聴かせて　
 焼けて　剥がれ　波間に落ちろ
 渚に寄せて　欠けていく　黒く

 '''English'''

 melting, falling apart, sinking in flames
 let me hear your voice
 burning, peeling apart, sink between the waves
 draw me to the shore, falling apart, darker


ーOther things people heardー
<div style="white-space:pre">
あなたの声を聴かせて → 抗う声聴かせて
let me hear your voice → let me hear the struggling voices

欠けていく黒く → 欠けていく白く
falling apart, darker → falling apart, brighter

欠けていく黒く → 欠けていく記憶
falling apart, darker → memories falling apart
</div>

Notes:

- Man, 'melting' and 'peeling' are rather vivid descriptions of EXPLODING IN THE HEAT OF A NUKE

- The 'shore' also appears in the Jellyfish Princess' damaged intro line because she's not anywhere near the shore in real life I guess
