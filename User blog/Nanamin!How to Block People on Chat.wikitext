Sometimes you don't wanna see somebody even talk in chat because they're just that big of a fucktard. In that case, this is what you need.

Go to [[Special:MyPage/chat.css]] (click that) and put this in.

    .Chat li[data-user="Y u no sink"] { display: none; }

If you need to add any more, just copy the line and replace the value with the person's username.
