I don't understand why fellow TTks can clear E3 Hard Easily. I mean, they can clear just with 20-35K resources. 

Well, here's my E3 Hard (spent almost 80K fuel and 500 buckets on E3 Hard Mode '''Last Dance only'''. And still failed):

HP Gauge : Doing smoothly until the last dance.

Most successful boss node runs :

1 : Yeah, no taiha for the escort fleet, entered yasen; failed to kill the boss.

2 : Only the boss left, entered yasen with no damaged Kitakami. She Failed the cut-in and "MISS"ed.

3 : Entered yasen, Kitakami and Abukuma (Abukuma = 31 Luck) cut-in succeed, but wrong target.

4 : Only The Boss and one BB Hime left, Kitakami is green, entered yasen. Kitakami cut-in succeed, but wrong target again...

5 : Entered yasen, Kitakami and friends' cut-in succeed, The boss left at '1' HP. Failed...

and... The rest runs were awful.

Gave up hard mode, switched to Medium and cleared E3 in a flash. 3 retreats during TP Phase and 1 retreat during HP Gauge phase.

Did RNG punish me because I easily (without farming) got [[Graf Zeppelin]], [[Mizuho]], [[Asagumo]], [[Kazagumo]], [[Hatsukaze]]? And... 2nd [[Akitsushima]] as a bonus?
