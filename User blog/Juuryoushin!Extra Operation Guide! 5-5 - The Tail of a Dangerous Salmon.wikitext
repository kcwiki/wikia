Here we go. Another Extra Operation, and the last one to be unlocked. (At least for now.) It resets at the start of the month, like any other one, and yields a medal plus some ranking points, as always.

'''To unlock this map, you need to clear 5-4 first.''' Don't think unlocking it means you can directly tackle it with ease, though.

Like 4-5, you need to '''sink the flagship at the boss node 5 times''' in order to complete this map. '''1 medal & 200 ranking points''' are given upon clearing it.

You have two major routes at your disposal to reach and have a chance to kill the boss. A second composition involving a light fleet and the usage of at least 5 [[Drum Canister]]s can go to another route. This one has very few chances of fulfilling the said goal. Therefore, I don't recommend taking this route.

The composition for the other routes doesn't have a big influence, so stick to a fleet that consists of mostly heavy ships. There are several threats regardless the decision you will choose. The enemy is no pushover on this map. Bring the best, prepare for the worst.

For this map, [[Support Expedition]]s can be used for the whole travel or just for the Boss node. Given the difficulty, it is highly advised to make good use of them to improve your chances even further.

Unlike the three previous Extra Operations, you don't have to worry about the amount of LoS your fleet is carrying, since none of the branching rules require a LoS check.

Now that those points are clear, it is time to unveil the strategies to overcome this map.

'''Fleet setup: 4 FBB 2 CV'''

<div style="text-align:right">[[User_blog:Juuryoushin/Extra_Operation_Guide:_5-5_-_The_Tail_of_a_Dangerous_Salmon#World 5-5:【Extra Operation】サーモン海域北方 Northern Salmon Sea Area|back to top]]</div>

===Route Strategy===

As the writer of this blog, it's the first possible composition I will show. (Since I'm using it)

'''4 FBB 2 CV''' is a classical composition that leads to a guaranteed route until the Preboss Node. You need a '''full-fast fleet''' to go through this route, so any slow BB must be avoided in order to stay on the right way. If you have any slow ship, the compass will take you to node C, where a bunch of Submarines will tear your fleet apart in Night battle.

As a rule of thumb, it's better to place your Battleships in the first 4 slots to let them attack faster in case of a 2nd shelling phase or a Night battle. Carriers should be put at the bottom since they are sitting ducks during the latter phase.

The same composition can be used during the entire map as long as you have enough '''Fighter Power''' to achieve '''Air Superiority''' when facing the Last Dance.

Most enemies on this route are relatively easy to deal with, except a few exceptions. 

The '''Re-Class Battleship''' on Node A can sometimes cause some trouble, but nothing truly threatening. 
On Node D, You have a chance to encounter a '''Standard Carrier Wo-Class Kai''', who can potentially damage one ship during the opening airstrike. The main hurdle dwells on Node E, where a '''Battleship Re-Class Elite''' awaits. 
She can either damage your fleet with her opening airstrike, her opening torpedo and her shelling. Be sure to lower her HP to at least '''Moderate Damage''' to skip a returning Torpedo on the closing phase. 
Lastly, you have a 25% chance to go to the '''Deadend on Node L''', so don't be too surprised if you waste a few runs. 

I strongly recommend to spark your entire fleet before running this map. It will help you passing through the Preboss Node as it increases Accuracy and Evasion for everyone.

===Equipment Review===

As seen on the setup above, your fleet must wield the best possible equipment to optimize its overall performance. Here is a step-by-step review to understand why they must be equipped this way.

Fast Battleships:

* To begin with, Fast Battleships are subject to '''Overweight Penalty'''. This mechanic lower their accuracy a lot if they are loaded with anything superior to a 35.6cm Gun. It means that their Firepower will surely not reach the cap. (which is 150). You can afford to put one heavier caliber but ensure that this one must have some accuracy on it to lower the debuff. That being said, equip your FBBs with 2 main guns while taking this into account. It's even better if you have modded guns in your possession. If that's the case, equip them immediately.
* Next, load them with a [[Type 0 Observation Seaplane]] to ensure that they can use Artillery Spotting. This plane offers better stat boosts than its weaker version, the [[Type 0 Reconnaissance Seaplane]].
* Lastly, don't forget to put an Armor Piercing Shell on each one of them. This last piece of equipment allows them to do either a Double Attack or a Cut-In. In addition, it helps punching through high-armored enemies, and there are a lot of them on this map.

Standard Carriers:

* For each biggest slot, put your best Fighter planes to get the best benefit from them. As always, Kaga's 46 plane slot is useful to fulfill the requirement with more ease. Having the exact Fighter Power to get Air Superiority at the Boss Node is not enough, as some fighters will get shot down along the way. Bring some excess to counter this issue. To prevent complete rank wipes, Fighter planes should be put on the lowest slots.
* Due to [[Aircraft Proficiency]] system, it's advised to put a bomber on the first slot of your carriers. A max-ranked bomber provides a 10% post-cap damage to every attack opportunity it gets. If you don't have enough Fighter Power, you can tweak the slot order a bit to stay above the required number.
* If you have the [[Zero Fighter Model 62 (Fighter-bomber / Iwai Squadron)]], try putting it on the second highest slot of one of your carriers. It can prove to be efficient if you have difficulties reaching the right number. Since it's considered as a Dive Bomber in the first place, avoid putting it in a low slot.
* Leave a room for a [[Saiun]] in the lowest slot of one of your carriers to prevent a Red T Cross engagement. This ensures a better damage output against the Boss.

===Node Guide===

Node A: Depending on the enemy composition and your Air power, you may or not get Air Supremacy on this node. There are two compositions requiring 420 AS amongst the two. It doesn't matter that much since no one can pose a threat except maybe the Battleship Re-Class lying around. As a bonus, if you sent a support fleet, it can partially get the job done before the shelling phase. Go Line Ahead and eradicate this fleet.

Node D: You can encounter Black Wock Shooter on this node if you are unlucky. Thanks to the Diamond formation, their accuracy and power will suck most of the time. You can't get AS+ on this node however, as it requires at least 512 Fighter power. The other composition is nothing to worry about. Go Line Ahead and explode them.

Node E: Here is the node when most sorties will end. The mighty Battleship Re-Class Elite has many ways of damaging (if not one-shotting) your ships before they can even attack. The Airstrike and the Torpedo salvo are both dangerous and can lead to heavy damage instantly, especially in Line Ahead for the latter. Her shelling can also devastate any ship, even a Yamato-class Battleship. This is why you need a sparkled fleet here. The support fleet plays a key role since it can reduce the number of targets and thus, leave more room to your ships to disable Re Elite as fast as possible. If you are extremely lucky, it can damage or even take her out, but don't expect that to happen in any of your runs.
Go Line Ahead and pray.

After that, you can be led to the node L, which is a deadend with nothing inside. This means a big middle finger to you, your resources, your fleet and your sanity. If it's not the case, welcome to the Boss node.

Node N (Boss): This node could have been much more unforgiving if it wasn't for the formation you are facing. And indeed, the boss is in Diamond formation, which means shitty accuracy all across the board. If you brought the Boss support with you, it will prove to be even easier to succeed. Given the composition you have, the Sub will also be completely ignored. It's both a bad and good thing for you. You'll have 5 targets, and at the same time, S-rank will be out of reach. Go Line Ahead and kill this Wo Kai Flagship.


For the Last Dance, the AS requirement will be a bit higher, but the Re-Class Elite will no longer be here. This enemy composition can therefore be seen as slightly easier.
For shits & giggles, you can also attempt to run this map after clearing it, it has a possible third pattern which basically swaps out Wo Kai and Re Elite's positions.

'''Fleet Setup: 1 CVL 3 BB 2 CV'''

(Setup borrowed from [[User:EchoHolic|EchoHolic]])

<div style="text-align:right">[[User_blog:Juuryoushin/Extra_Operation_Guide:_5-5_-_The_Tail_of_a_Dangerous_Salmon#World 5-5:【Extra Operation】サーモン海域北方 Northern Salmon Sea Area|back to top]]</div>

===Route Strategy===

This is the second possible composition for this route. If you are willing to give up on the full-fast fleet, it's a good option to take. There are no restrictions on what type of BBs you can bring. On the other hand, you have to trade the missing BB for a CVL to fulfill one of the requirements to be taken to node D. Add 2 CVs to complete it and secure the routing until the Preboss Node.

The CVL should be Flagship for two reasons. First, it is the most squishy ship of the fleet. Secondly, if your CVL does not equip any offensive plane, it will skip its turn and allow the ship on the second slot to attack first during the second shelling phase. (And mind you, this is something you WANT to happen.) Your Battleships will follow right after it, the strongest comes first, the weakest comes last. As for CVs, they will be on the two last slots as usual.

This composition gives an easier time to spread your planes since you have 3 carriers in your fleet. Like the previous one, you won't need to change it until the end of the Operation.

Enemies have the exact same patterns since you are taking the same route, so no need to re-explain it. The Sparkling recommendation remains unchanged. If you want to maximize your chances, come fully sparkled.

===Equipment Review===

The setup for this composition has a slightly different reasoning. The outcome still stays the same, however.

Battleships:

* Both Yamato-Class battleships don't suffer from '''Overweight Penalty'''. (except for 46cm mounts, it's still minor, don't worry too much.) You can go all-out with your arsenal for them. Just put your best heavy caliber guns and watch them destroy everything. Their absurd base firepower allows them to get over the '''Engagement form''' handicap, as they can reach 200 Firepower with an appropriate setup. Only a Red T-cross engagement can cripple their power a bit, but given the equipment you should have, it simply cannot happen. If you opted for Nagato-class, rejoice, they are not affected by the Overweight. they just won't be as powerful.
* The Mandatory [[Type 0 Observation Seaplane]] remains present for this setup. You don't want to waste such an [[Artillery Spotting|useful mechanic]], huh ?
* A good [[Type 1 Armor Piercing Shell]] will complete the set to deal better damage against heavy armored ships. If you have both Yamato-class with you, it should be a walk in the park to obliterate any hurdle on their way.


Bismarck Drei:

Compared to other Battleships, she has an unique setup going with her. Not much different, but worth mentioning if you are questioning yourself about this choice.

* First, she is a Fast Battleship, so avoid any very heavy caliber you have in hand. Instead, the best choice for her is a double [[38cm Twin Gun Mount Kai]]. This gun has the best accuracy and a good firepower. (Even more when modded to a high level) She can easily get close to the firepower cap, so nothing to worry about.
* A [[Type 98 Reconnaissance Seaplane (Night Recon)]] to improve accuracy, critical rate and firepower during Night battle. If you failed to kill the Boss during day battle, this plane can correct that. Do note that this plane isn't exclusive to Bismarck and can be put on any of the three Battleship you wish to choose.
* An Armor Piercing Shell to finish your preparations, not much to say.


Light Carrier: 

* Since you have more room to fit fighter planes, take advantage of this fact to make a Reppuu Mule with it. A CVL won't deal much damage to begin with, so the best it can do is to contribute at giving the best air power. It further reinforces this statement as the CVs fit more the bomber role with their better overall stats. It will also pass the turn on the ship placed right below, which should be a BB.
* A [[Saiun]] on the lowest slot is perfect here. It nullifies the Red T Cross engagement risk and once again frees a slot for more offensive planes to load in your CVs.


Standard Carriers:

* The [[Aircraft Proficiency]] system allows you to put your best fighter planes somewhere else than the biggest slots. It's especially true given the fighter power your CVL alone can handle. Another explanation to this is that the first slot will be free for a Torpedo/Dive bomber plane, which gives a 10% post-cap damage upon hitting targets. Put your fighters on the 2nd or 3rd slots.
* As said on the first point, bomber planes can be put on the first slot to benefit from the post-cap damage bonus. If you feel like you are in need of more Air Power, the [[Zero Fighter Model 62 (Fighter-bomber / Iwai Squadron)]] can be used on the first slot too. Otherwise, you're better off placing a strong Torpedo bomber like [[Tenzan Model 12 (Murata Squadron)]] for instance. It will buff your airstrike in exchange.
* From here, it's up to the player to choose what to put on the remaining slots. Like the setup showed above, you can put Torpedo Bulges ( [[Pugliese Underwater Protection Bulkhead]] works too.) to make your CVs more likely to survive Re Elite's onslaught when she appears. It works best if you have both Shoukaku and Zuikaku in Kai 2 A form. They already have high HP and Evasion, and a Bulge will put them at the level of a BB in term of survivability. 
On the other hand, you don't have much choices. You can either reinforce accuracy and evasion a bit or put some other equipment that might fit your needs. Other than the Bulges, A [[Type 32 Surface Radar]] can do the work fairly well.

===Node Guide===

There is not much to say here, the majority of the points are already explained in the [[User_blog:Juuryoushin/Extra_Operation_Guide:_5-5_-_The_Tail_of_a_Dangerous_Salmon#Node Guide|Previous section]]. I will just sum them up.

Node A: You should have a better Fighter power (and maybe Airstrike) here, so you may get AS+ regardless the composition you will face. Line Ahead and kill everything in sight.

Node D: It's also possible to get AS+ if you heavily focused on fighters. Nothing to say for this node otherwise. Line Ahead and kill everything.

Node E: The node where you pray regardless your composition. Watch out for your CVL as it may turn to Moderate or Heavy Damage fairly quickly. Not only Re Elite can damage it here. The only saving grace is the plot armor it's subject to. As it's completely overwhelmed by Re Elite's firepower, it has a good chance to be lowered to Moderate Damage at worst. Oh and, choose Line Ahead too.

Again, don't forget about '''Node L'''. It can ruin your day.

Node N (Boss): The boss should be easy to deal with. You have some of the heaviest ships to respond to this enemy fleet, so choose Line Ahead to blast everything you can.

'''Fleet Setup: 2 FBB 4 CV OR 1 FBB 5 CV'''

(Setup borrowed from [[User:Faeriedust|Faeriedust]])

<div style="text-align:right">[[User_blog:Juuryoushin/Extra_Operation_Guide:_5-5_-_The_Tail_of_a_Dangerous_Salmon#World 5-5:【Extra Operation】サーモン海域北方 Northern Salmon Sea Area|back to top]]</div>

===Route Strategy===

This composition relies more on bomber power than anything else. Carrier lovers will find themselves pleased to see that it can work reliably with a good plane spread. In the same way as for the very first possible setup, it goes back to the "fast fleet" branching other than going all-out with heavy Battleships everywhere.

The 2 FBBs should be placed first as they can both attack in day and night battle. Carriers will fill the rest of the slots with no particular order between them.

You should have no issues achieving the required Fighter power. The main purpose of this fleet is to give enough space to have a very strong opening airstrike and bomber shelling. You don't need to change anything for Last Dance unless your setup was under the requirement. 

If you have both [[Shoukaku]] and [[Zuikaku]] under Kai-2 A form, now is a good time to field them. [[Taihou]] also works for this purpose. Their overall very good stats will help you punching through with extremely powerful airstrikes.

Again, same enemies on the way. And again, come sparkled for better chances of surviving.

===Equipment Review===

There is not much to explain here since the direction taken by this fleet is straightforward: Optimizing your bombing power.

Fast Battleships:

* Like the previous compositions, give them a pair of heavy caliber guns that does not create a pit to their accuracy.
* Always, the [[Type 0 Observation Seaplane]] to allow them to trigger Artillery Spitting.
* To complete the cake, a [[Type 1 Armor Piercing Shell]] to mix attacks. Double attack or cut-in, they'll deserve it.

Standard Carriers:

* First, what you need to keep in mind is the post-cap damage bonus for putting a Double Chevron bomber on the first slot. Give them the best Torpedo Bomber you have. One bomber for each carrier, no exception.
* Spread your fighter planes accordingly to meet the Fighter power requirement without blocking the way to the future bombers. (Last Dance included) Fighters will go on the lowest slots and NOT the biggest ones, which are reserved for bombers. [[Aircraft Proficiency]] will take care of the bonus even if your fighters are in a slow slot. Remember, you will get at least 24 fighter power for each Double Chevron plane you have in hand. If possible, try to stack bombers on Carriers with the highest base firepower to get a better effect.
* For the rest, you can either put a [[Saiun]] to prevent a Red T Cross engagement, or a piece of equipment that is capable of raising accuracy. [[Suisei (Egusa Squadron)]] and [[Type 32 Surface Radar]]s are good candidates for this.

===Node Guide===

The proceedings of the battle will be slightly different from the other compositions.
You have a strong air force, and possibly a Support fleet to finish to work.

Node A: Your airforce should take care of the fleet easily, except for Re who can still survive. In most cases, she may survive alone when the shelling starts. Line Ahead, and enjoy the post-cap damage bonus !

Node D: If Black Wock Shooter isn't around, you might have a chance to completely wipe out the enemy before the traditional shelling phase starts. None of the ships here are particularly tanky, so relax. Choose Line Ahead, as always.

Node E: It gets complicated from this node. A Carrier-based fleet will have trouble surviving a Re Elite if both the airstrike and the possible support your brought along failed. Carriers are somewhat fragile for the most part, but can still deliver a strong blow no matter what. You still have a chance to cripple her to at least Moderate damage, but don't count too much on this. Go Line Ahead and bomb everything.

Node L will be on your way. You can't bomb an empty node, sorry !

Node N (Boss): The boss can get either tricky or terribly easy, it only depends on how your main weapons will work. Both airstrike and Boss support can easily reduce the amount of targets to at least 3. A vast majority of the enemies should be wiped without trouble. In case you still haven't killed the Wo Kai Flagship, get into the night battle with your 2 FBBs to sink it.

'''Fleet Setup: 3 BB 3 SS'''

(Setup borrowed from [[User:ArcticaFrost|ArcticaFrost]])

<div style="text-align:right">[[User_blog:Juuryoushin/Extra_Operation_Guide:_5-5_-_The_Tail_of_a_Dangerous_Salmon#World 5-5:【Extra Operation】サーモン海域北方 Northern Salmon Sea Area|back to top]]</div>

===Route Strategy===

The last known/used composition for this map. This one stands out from the rest because of the route it takes. You don't have any planes at all, so prepare to give up on the usual combat. In exchange, the node L is completely absent, which means that your route is 100% fixed.

The flagship should be your luckiest SS. [[I-58]] and [[Ro-500]] are your best candidates to fulfill this role. Their cut-in rate will therefore be boosted through the roof during night battles. You will only rely on this at the Boss node and nowhere else. It should be noted that Yamato-class Battleships are really important for this setup. Their very heavy armor will help getting through the map with a Torpedo Bulge on them.

Last Dance or not, nothing changes at all. You already have no fighter power to begin with, so stick with what you have.

Enemies on this route are a bit different. More importantly, the goal here is to eliminate all ASW-capable ships before the shelling phase since most of them will probably one shot your three Subs. Formation doesn't matter that much given the power needed to wreck them.
There will be a LOT of ASW-capable enemies on node F. This is why both your preemptive torpedoes and node support are so important.
Running this fleet will be somewhat cheap on resources. There are no planes and 3 of your ships cost almost nothing.

It should be a given until now, but don't forget to sparkle your ships. Subs in particular will need it because their Evasion value is horribly low.

===Equipment Review===

Different route, different setup. There are new things to clear up here.

Submarines:

* All Submarines should have double torpedoes on them to boost their damage and allow cut-in attacks during night battles. As said above, you will need this for the boss node, where you will be almost forced to enter night battle everytime in order to finish the work. Important thing to note, '''DON'T EQUIP''' [[Kouhyouteki]]s on them. Despite boasting a good torpedo boost, '''It isn't counted as a torpedo'''. It will effectively remove any cut-in chance.
* The Lucky flagship should obligatory equip the best torpedoes of your inventory. It will boost its damage a lot as a consequence.

Battleships:

* A pair of heavy caliber guns for their respective type. Avoid very heavy calibers on Fast Battleships, and go all-out for those who don't suffer from any penalty.
* Your best Armor Piercing shell for each one of them. If you feel like it, you can place a [[Searchlight]] or its [[Type 96 150cm Searchlight|upgraded version]] on one Battleship to improve your night battle performance against the Boss.
* A torpedo bulge on each last slot. Since you have no Fighter power, Artillery Spotting will be completely out of reach. The best way to pass in this case is to reinforce their armor. They can still perform double attack at night if you followed the same setup from the start.

<div style="text-align:right">[[User_blog:Juuryoushin/Extra_Operation_Guide:_5-5_-_The_Tail_of_a_Dangerous_Salmon#World 5-5:【Extra Operation】サーモン海域北方 Northern Salmon Sea Area|back to top]]</div>

===Node Guide===

Each battle is somewhat stressful due to the permanent risk of your Submarines getting heavily damaged in one hit. Fear not, if you brought both supports, it should be much more bearable.

Node A: The traditional first Re node. One thing to mention in particular is Re's ability to attack Submarines, making it a dangerous and durable enemy to fight. DDs/CLs can inflict the same pain, even if one hit is enough to obliterate them. Proceed in Line Ahead, your torpedo accuracy will be much better.

Node F: This node can be dangerous due to the number of ASW-capable you have to face. Hopefully, all of them can be sunk without any resistance. Once again, the Node support can save you from an early retreat. I don't need to mention that you will go Line Ahead for this node.

Node G: This node is similar to E. Re Elite has the exact same ability like her basic counterpart. She is just much tankier and can potentially fire twice at your Submarines. The Airstrike risk is still present however, and you have literally nothing to protect against it. Same goes for the preemptive torpedo. The bulges will prove to be more effective to protect against those two attacks. For the rest, you have to pray for your Submarines to survive..... In Line Ahead.

Node L is nonexistent, you can relax on this route. Once you're done with Re, it's a guaranteed Boss node for you.

Node N (Boss): The boss is somewhat harder since you have no air power to counteract against the heavy air-based fleet. The support and your preemptive torpedoes should take care of the 2 Flagship destroyers first, as they still have the possibility to damage your Submarines. Re Elite will once again be here and attack your subs as well. If your fleet stayed in a good shape, go into night battle. You have a chance that your flagship submarine will take out the Wo Kai Flagship with a cut-in attack directly, leaving you with nothing left to face but some Re-maining meatshield.
The Last Dance will replace Re by [[Southern War Princess]], which removes one threat for your Submarines, but adds one for your Battleships.

If you've been reading this post without taking a shortcut to the Support Expedition paragraphs, now is the time to take a look at it.

'''Fleet setup: 2 DD 2 BB 2 CV(L)'''

<div style="text-align:right">[[User_blog:Juuryoushin/Extra_Operation_Guide:_5-5_-_The_Tail_of_a_Dangerous_Salmon#World 5-5:【Extra Operation】サーモン海域北方 Northern Salmon Sea Area|back to top]]</div>

===Mechanics===

For Support Expeditions, your main concern is to throw off the right equipment to have a good damage output and the best possible accuracy increase. You will also need ships with high base firepower to make it work better.

By default, this composition will trigger the Shelling Support. The other types aren't worth the usage. Just stick to this one.

The Node support will need to be entirely sparkled to be truly effective, or else they will not show up very often. (or miss 6/6 times.) Each sparkled ship increases accuracy and the chances of triggering, so optimize that to get the best results. The default percentage is set at 50%. It can be set to ~80% if the entire fleet is sparkled.

The Boss support is slightly different, since only the flagship will affect the chances of appearing. The base percentage is at 80% no matter what. A sparkled flagship guarantees its appearance.
This doesn't prevent you from sparkling the entire fleet, just to have a better accuracy.

In the long run, the Node support can prove to be more efficient as it does not appear only once. It's up to you to decide if you want to use only one, both or simply not use them to save resources if you think your fleet can handle it.

===Equipment Review===

Because we need one. This will also cover ship choices, at they can matter a lot firepower-wise.

* Destroyers don't have any efficient way to raise their firepower drastically, and their damage output is quite low to begin with. Naturally, the best candidates are those with the highest base Firepower. Yuudachi and Ayanami are the absolute best at this job, no matter what. The best for them is to load them with a full Radar setup to get the best accuracy.
* Battleships, on the other hand, can get very close to the firepower softcap by having 2 heavy caliber guns each. You can also put 1 Gun and then 3 Radars, it will make them more accurate but less powerful. 2 Guns and 2 radars is generally a good balance in most cases. Nagato-class is somewhat hard on costs, but they can prove to be efficient here. 
* Carriers can deliver the most powerful hits given the different damage calculation they do have. The better plane type to put here is the Dive Bomber. Its value is basically doubled, making it more effective than any type. In theory, if your carrier already has a high firepower, one Dive bomber is enough to reach the firepower softcap. Then, you can fill the rest with radars to increase accuracy. If you want to be on the safe side power-wise, put 2 of your best Dive Bombers then 2 Radars for them. Be aware that the Engagement form can influence the power of your Support fleet too. Hiryuu and Souryuu are especially useful for this role given their high base firepower. Their unbalanced plane spread further warrants this as it completely nullifies a potential slot wipe during a Support expedition.

With all these tools & options, you should be able to handle this map. If you have any suggestion, leave a comment !

Have fun !
