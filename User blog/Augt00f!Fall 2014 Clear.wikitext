[[File:Fall_2014_Log.png|thumb|400px]]Finished event on 1st hours of 2nd day (15th of Nov), event was pretty easy, no major stressful moments. Stocked a lot of resources and buckets but didnt use almost anything. Included a Worst RNG moment.

Thanks to Kazami Yuuka for advices on formation and compositionÂ on chat room, hope i can give a hand in the next event.

Im considering farming E-2 for Akashi if drop rate seems higher than 1-5 or 2-5, lower res consumption and slowly grinding Akizuki (lvl 40 right now)

Finally did LSC 4/6/6/2/20 , Akizuki flagship

Ise, Akitsumaru, Hyuuga, Mutsu, Nagato, Haruna, Hiei, Haruna
Thats my 3rd akitsu, im fine with daihatsu and gyros so wasnt a complete waste of resources.
P.S. On my notepad i think i forgot to take note of some boss kills.
