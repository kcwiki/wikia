There's a small glimmer

In the salty sea

When the smell of the ocean breeze

Can't be washed away

A quiet suffering

In the docks by me

The salt is for the unfortunate owner

Just to drown me too

And caaaan you taste the salt toooooonight

This is how I dieeee

It's too much, for this Shortland resident

So I pray to god

And caaaaan you taste the salt toooonight

I was a hopeless man

It's too much to make lakes and open seas

It's a tiring quest

.......
