==1st part==

Some info about E3 : At least 2CV and no more than 2BB in the first fleet, i suggest the following combination : 2BB4CV<br />2nd fleet need 1CL, you can place no more than 2CA in this fleet, the rest should be DD, example : 1CL 3DD 2CA<br />This map needs very high LOS to reach the boss node, and i screwed up in the first run...

==2nd part==

With enough LOS and correct setup you should be able to reach boss node and not taking much damage during the trip... Boss can hit hard but that is unlikely that you can't kill her with 12 ships ! In short, E3 is easy for a well prepared admiral.

==3rd part==

Just cleared E3... didn't know that was the final kill, anyway i start recording after beaver killed carrier demon with her cut-in attack... In this video i also showed my current E-3 equipments, and something i forgot to mention before, i recommended at least 400 "aerial power" which can be calculated here : http://www.kancolle-calc.net/aircrafts.html (note: Japanese only)
