=Intro=

If you have experienced a catbomb and asked for help over at the [[Tutorial: Proxy Connection|Connection]] page, you may have at one point been asked to perform a [[wikipedia:Layer four traceroute|Layer Four Traceroute]] (LFT). It may have been followed by a scene wherein you're struck dumb by a hard slap of a geeky phrase right across your frontal lobes. Hopefully this guide can help avoid that scene.

This guide is designed for Windows users; those on 'nix are smarter than I and know what the heck I'm talking about here. [[File:Amagi.png|48px|link=]]

=First, a Little Background=

<table style="background:#CDF;border:3px solid #ACF;width:85%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding:0;">

A Layer Four Traceroute (hereafter referred to as an '''<code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">LFT</code>''') is a modification of the <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">traceroute</code> / <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracert</code> program used to discover the path your connection takes from your computer to the servers you're connecting to (in this case, the Kancolle servers).

===Traceroute?===

Yes, <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">traceroute</code> (<code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracert</code> on Windows). Both traceroute and LFT work on similar principles.

===So, What's the Difference?===

Good, old <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">traceroute</code> / <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracert</code>, sadly, doesn't work on Kancolle. Here's the rub: '''traceroute and LFT use different methods, and the Kancolle servers ''reject'' traceroute's methods'''<ref>''Very'' technical note: traceroute/tracert uses [[wikipedia:Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]], which works on a low level and is rejected by the Kancolle servers. LFT, on the other hand, uses [[wikipedia:Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which works on a higher level and is the same method your browser uses to connect to the servers when playing, and hence is accepted by the servers.</ref>. To illustrate, here's output of a <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracert</code> to a Kancolle server:

You can't tell if you've reached the Kancolle server using <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracert</code>; line 10 could've been a broken router between you and the Kancolle server, or it could've been the Kancolle server, but <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracert</code> won't know because the server blocks the program's probings. Contrast that with the LFT trace, where you'll instantly know you're connected to the server (except the broken node in #4, which is "interesting").

Now you're convinced that you need LFT for helping you solve your catbomb woes. How are you going to use it? Before that, how are you going to ''get'' it? (Windows doesn't come with LFT by default.)

=The Solution: <code>tracetcp</code>=
<span id="guide"></span>
<code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">'''tracetcp'''</code> is a neat little tool that does just that: an LFT. Now, whenever you're asked to perform an LFT, you can just fire it up and submit the output to whoever asked you to perform it.

"So how do I fire it up?" you ask. Good question.

=Using <code>tracetcp</code>=

<code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracetcp</code> requires a bit of setup. It also requires that you're logged in to the computer as an Administrator.

===#1: Install Pre-requisite(s)===

For <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracetcp</code> to work you'll need WinPcap, which is what <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracetcp</code> uses to do its magic. If you've been following my [[User blog:Martirsadota/Utilizing Wireshark for Kancolle Asset Grabbing|tutorial on asset grabbing]], Wireshark already installed WinPcap for you. If you haven't, get the installer [http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm here,] install and proceed.

===#2: Get <code>tracetcp</code>===
Grab the latest version from their [https://github.com/simulatedsimian/tracetcp/releases GitHub.] Download the zip, extract it to a folder in a convenient place, and you're done. That's all there is for setup.

===#3: Fire It Up!===
Go to the folder where you extracted <code style="background-color:#DEF;border:3px solid #DEF;border-radius:4px;">tracetcp</code>. Right-click an empty area of the folder's window while holding down the <code>Shift</code> key. If you did it right, you should see an '''Open command window here''' option. Click that.

Aaaaaaand what's this? It's geek haven, the command line. It's time for the moment of truth. Type this in:

<pre>tracetcp [your Kancolle server's IP address]</pre>

(You can look up your server's IP address [[Servers|here]].)

and hit <code>Enter</code>. Whew! If everything's set up correctly you should see output like the one below:

which you can now copypasta (hint: '''Right-click > Mark''') to whoever you need (or want) to send the output to.
