Hallo an alle. Man that was bad...

Hello! Welcome back to my reports. I still don't know why you read them. However! Even if I don't know, I will still continue forth putting these out. And boy is this one long overdue. It's been since the Summer Event. and man was it a doozy. If you haven't seen from my Summer Event Report, well then prepare to get salty. 'Cause I got like 19 new ships. Some of the preeeety rare (*cough cough* Prinz Eugen, Akizuki, and the Unryuu-class *cough cough*). Adn with that I shall call my Summer Event a success, well, with getting all the event ships and all. But this report isn't about that. No! This report is about what has happened since then! And I shall start from the top.

SOURYUU KAI 2

When I first got her, she was oh-so underused. I mean, her level was below Akagi. And that isÂ '''bad'''. However, after she saw extensive use the the farming brigade that was E-4, her level shot up, and was already close to remodeling when the Summer Event ended. So, being the good admiral that I am, gave her a treat and remodeled her. After all, her planes are good, and her stats are too. Now I have to remodel Shoukaku so she can be with her sister...

HIEI KAI 2

If I already reported this, sorry. But, with her and Souryuu being used extensively throughout last event, I remodeled her while battling Booty-Hime. And man does she make the difference. Having Kongou is nice, but Hiei is definitely and addition. None of can compare to Haruna though... Anyways, one more sister to go and I'll have the Kongou sisters fully remodeled and ready to crush any BB in my way.

ABUKUMA KAI 2

Heeyy, that's pretty good. After meaning to remodel her for a long time, I never got around to it, leveling destroyers that I desperately needed to keep my head above water, to grinding out drops, to just plain using other CL's. However, her time has come, and I know that the longer I wait, the more I will suffer in the long run. So, after remodeling Souryuu, I immediately went to work on Abukuma. And man, does it feel good. I do feel the need for more medals though, and I sorely regret burning all of my medals in the Spring Event for one last chance at Iowa. But the past is the past, and Abukuma here will help me shape the future.

ACQUISITION OF A FOREIGN BATTLESHIP

What? Can it be? Yes, yes it can. FOR I HAVE ACQUIRED A NECESITY IN ALL ADMIRAL'S FLEETS. BEHOLD, BISMARCK!!!!

And with this, I end my report. I hoped to get this out sooner, but school is bogging me down. I know, I know, typical response.



P.S. Ashigara and Kirishima are both, like, 4-5 levels from being remodeled.
