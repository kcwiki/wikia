==Introduction==
Due to an incident, it was made clear that the information on the wiki regarding drum expeditions no longer accurately described the actual mechanics behind it. As a result, I started logging the results under various conditions (and a few other kind souls have since joined in) to see if we can get a better understanding of how great success on drum expeditions works.

Partners in this test:
*[[User:Zel-melon/Drum Sparkle Project|Zel-Melon]]
*[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Homuhomu123/Preliminary_Study_on_the_Great_Success_Chance_%26_Item_Rate Homuhomu123]
*Flonnaru (Stats currently private)
==Summary==
A summary based on (mostly) my own data, for those who don't really want to read the data recorded so far (keep in mind things may change as more data is recorded, and other testers may have different results):
*Sparkles add approximately a 15~16% chance to great success for each sparkled ship
*Levels ''may'' affect the base chance for great success by a small degree (4~6%).
**Assuming it is true, it is currently not known if both flagship level and total fleet level account for this, or if it is just one of the two factors
*With 0 sparkles, minimum required drums equipped, and a high level flagship/total fleet level, the rate for GS is approximately 10%
**Adding additional drums can increase this chance to approximately 40%. Thus if achieving 100% GS is your only concern, then 4 sparkles with a high level flagship/total fleet level and several more drums equipped than required '''''should''''' result in a 100% GS rate

Significance of Levels=

Partially through the recordkeeping, concerns about the impact of flagship/total level became more apparent. This section will compare the data between a fleet running Expedition 21 with the following criteria:

'''Low level fleet'''
*Level 15~20 Flagship
*Total fleet level 30~40
*3 drums
*No sparkles
'''High level fleet'''
*Level 50+ Flagship
*Total fleet level 280+
*3 drums
*No sparkles

Current data (along with the data of partners) suggests levels have an impact on GS rates.

Flonnaru's data for expeditions 21 and 37 with 3 sparkles and 14 drums return a similar rate of 86.2% with 200~ runs done. Thus, I am fairly confident in saying 86% is the rate for 3 sparkled ships with 'maximum' drums (and considering the same rate was achieved with less drums, the 'maximum' drum cap is probably even lower than expected.

==Recordkeeping (Minimum Drums)==

[[File:DrumGStest.png|left]]This project is still very much in its infancy and requires far more runs for a decent sample size in addition to testing different numbers of sparkled ships, but based on preliminary observations, either sparkles seem to add around 12% success rate per ship (assuming base 50% success rate), or the great success rate cap lies around 90%. Its still too early to come to conclusions though.

I plan on updating the online information every now and then, until I have 100 sorties on each variant, and add a test for 2 sparkled ships (maybe more later on, depending on results). If anyone has any suggestions, I am all ears!

No huge changes yet, just an update to include Flagship/Total Level (suggested by Homuhomu) and the % added per sparkle for easier viewing.

[[File:GSrecord3.png|left]]

Holy crap what happened here. Failure to get GS shot up quite a bit (e.g exp 21 going from a 1 in 8 failure rate, to a 1 in 4 rate by comparison). If the GS rate does turn out to be 8% per sparkle, then testing 4 or even 5 sparkles may be necessary in the future.

! Weekly Update 2
|-
|

[[File:GSrecord4.png|left]]100 sorties done for Exp.21 with 3 sparkled ships, with the results being...less than desirable. Assuming 50% is the base rate, sparkled ships add a mere 3.33% chance to receiving Great Success, which doesn't really make sense.

Interestingly though, using the base rate from preliminary unsparkled Exp.21 runs raises this to a more believable 10.35%, raising a suspicion that the base rate for Exp 21 is '''NOT 50%'''. Exp.37 appears to be stabilizing, with 14 of 23 runs being a Great Success (60.87%) compared to last week's rate of 9 of 20 (45%).

Edit: Minor Update to the table to publically show % using recorded base %.

! Weekly Update 3

[[File:GSrecord6.png|left]]













Updated the table to record secondary item rates with great success, although I may not continue with this feature given the rate of great success is already low enough on its own. Anyways Exp 37 with 3 sparkles is complete, and shows pretty awful rates like Exp 21 did. All the more suspicion that base rates are lower than 50%, and that levels don't seem to particularly matter. Which leads back to a previously shot down theory: what if drums do contribute to success rates? Tests on that will have to wait until I'm done with this batch first though.

! Weekly Update 4
|-
|

[[File:GSweek4.png|left]]It's been a while since the last update. I'd started running the lower sample expeditions, leading me to hold back on posting anything until the sizes were decent enough. I've done away with recording levels and boxes, after finding no improvement with higher level ships (although I believe Homu will continue recording this), and the infrequency of receiving GS with 3 drums making the box section a waste of space more than anything.

Anyway Exp21 (0) is done, and the rate is largely where I expected it to be, between 10~15%. Work has begun on 2 sparkles to get a better idea of how much sparkles contribute to GS%. So far the rates for 3 sparkles are pretty consistent/similar, but with 74 more runs to go for Exp38, differences may still yet to show themselves.
|}

{| class="wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
|-
! Weekly Update 5
|-
|
[[File:GSweek5.png|left]]More runs on Exp21 (2), 37 (0) and 38 (0).

Going by Exp21 (2)'s rates, added % per sparkle appears to be linear, which combined with base rate, would add to/exceed 100% GS rate with 6 sparkled ships. However, it is already known that failures happen even with 6 sparkles, so there is indeed some sort of hard cap on how much sparkles can help.
