Calculated with the losses, the hourly rate you'd get resources.

----


'''*Losses are calculated assuming that you're using only the common submarines, mutsuki class and tenryuu class kai.'''

221 / 224 / 13 / 13 for both expeditions 5 and 21

92 / 83 / 165 / 0 with expeditions 37 and 38

If actively sending out expeditions, it's best to send out 5 and 21 if you'd like the most fuel and ammo gain.



Great Success

353 / 349 / 20 / 20 for 5 and 21 (5 using a total of 3 subs for 100% GS)

164 / 152 / 250 / 0 for 38 and 37


By adding sparkled subs to expedition 5, the resources gained are increased in the long run:

4 required ships sparkled '''(76% Great Success rate)'''

245 / 276 / 28 / 28

4 ships + 1 sub '''(96% Great Success rate)'''

260 / 296 / 30 / 30

4 ships + 2 subs '''(100% Great Success rate)'''

264 / 300 / 30 / 30
