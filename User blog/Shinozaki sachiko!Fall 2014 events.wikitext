<p style="margin-bottom:1em;color:rgb(0,0,0);">for those who have problem with E-1 in case u are not sure what composition will make things so easy. here ill give it to you :</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">2CAV : 2x20.3cm + 2 zuiun</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">2CA : 2x20.3cm + 1 type 0 + 1 radar</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">2BBV : 2x41cm or better + 2 zuiun</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">2nd fleet</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">1CL : 2x15.5main gun + 1 torp</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">4DD : 2x10cm HA + quint torp</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">1CA : 2x20.3cm + 1x 15.5 sec gun. im lvl 70 and all my ships are around 30-40 (FP and armor maxed out tho). and always end up 2 ships medium damaged and able to sink the boss in day battle (sometimes night). </p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">it goes to A-C-E-F</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">so GL to those who havent finished it.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">ADDITIONAL : 100% to boss node (4 out of 4) use diamond formation at the node before boss node(unnecessary. unless u doubt ur AA capability) otherwise go battle formation (bottom right)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">i will try to find out E-2 composition from people and myself. and sum it up for you people who have trouble with it.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">E-2</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">2CL + 4DD (route kinda random)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">each CL equip a radar and double attack set up.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">every DD equips with 2x10cm HA + 1 torp (except for high luck ship like yukikaze go for 2 torp + 1x10cmHA)</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">C->G has LOS check. if you would like to pass this. equip 1 radar  for each ship. it should guarantee you pass it</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">line ahead every node, except for subnode (first northern route) do support expedition (no.134) if u have a problem against the boss.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">E-3</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">I dont have akitsumaru. but with this following fleet, i keep getting A rank (no S yet, i assume my low stat DD on 2nd fleet is the cause) with help from support expedition. no one ever get red (yet). 4 out of 4 run. no total boss kill yet though. here is the pict</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">[[File:KanColle-141123-00164206.png|thumb]][[File:KanColle-141123-00164417.png|thumb]]1st fleet. BB has 46 + 41 + seaplane + AP shell. BBV has 2x41 + 2x seaplane. CL has 2x15.5 (secondary) + radar. CA has 2x20.3 + seaplane + sanshiki. kaga has 3 reppu (last 3 slols) + 1 ryuusei in the 1st slot.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">
</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">2nd fleet. KTKM (you know what you should give her) CA has 2x20.3 +radar + 1 seaplane. DDs have double set up + radar. BB has 2x41 + radar + seaplane. CL has 2x15.5 (secondary) + radar</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">it is quite expensive. but it works well for those who have problem with it. you can try with 2CA instead 1CA 1BB for 2nd fleet.(not sure you can though).</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">apparently, if ur FS is a CL (for first fleet) you will likely go to maelstorm E. so stick with the picture posted and you should be just fine</p>
