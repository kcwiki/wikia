'''Impression:''' Ah...the first map of the event. Always simple, always easy. They lure you in like a bug into the mouth of a Venus fly trap. They boost your confidence and convince you to charge more into the abyss...which you do...like the Romans in the Battle of Cannae...before they enveloped you later...blocking your escape and crush your sanity right in front of your eyes. Of course, the higher the confidence is the more satisfying it is to crush it.

The scouting unit has been spotted. The fleet was sent and thus; the event started.

'''Impression:''' The continuation, you're lured deeper into the enemy's playing field. They threw out their first card; the combined fleet, the bane of many new admirals who do not have the strength in number. As we ventured into the ocean and crushed the boss we were trapped; they have now lock us here. But the enemy isn't stopping, another force is spotted close to the base and must be eliminated. For now, another fleet must partake in the event.

'''Impression:''' A new fleet was sent to the next corner of the map. We arrived at the Wall of Jericho...or so we thought...as lingering around the map for days did not bring the wall down. Its massive height (of HP) could rival that of the Walls of Babylon; Its massive length (of Salt) could rival that of the Great Wall of China; Its complexity (of why-don't-she-sink?) could rival that of the Wall of Constantinople with Archimedes on top.

The true horror of the map isn't the supposedly impregnable wall; it's the realization that...some of us might need to come back here to release [[Mizuho]].

'''Note''': Originally hard. I dropped my balls and attach some little female dog buttock cat into it. Because fuck this map. Fuck the China wall of CV, fuck the BS AV Armor, fuck the DD rekting my CV in one shot, fuck the Air battle, fuck the Wokoyaki, fuck the choice node, fuck this map.

Even last run is BS. The worst run I had with both my CV and Akizuki chuuha'd even before boss node and the others are slightly damaged and close to chuuha. They managed to perform so well at boss I don't even know how (4.75 of boss sunk before night battle)

I'm out of this map! PEA...oh wait...I'm gonna farm Isokaze here...

'''Kinda-real Reason''': I want to farm Isokaze. Ain't doing that on E-3 Hard...no fucking way.

Time spent in E-3 Hard: 17 runs

Time spent in E-3 Medium: 7 Clean runs + 7 Last Dance

I was planning on switching Verniy out and sacrifice one of my main force...turns out I don't need to as she got her act back and clear the map at last.

In the end....never get the chance to farm Isokaze because I was farming Kazagumo and she's not popping out.

Oh god, this map....especially the last run....it's like a you're 5 mins before reaching your workplace and diarrhea strikes...to make it worse there's a stupid traffic because a dude is giving blowjob to a dog. I gave it a few runs before deciding to just screw it and go easy (I already pussy out for E-3 so it doesn't feel that bad). On the other hand, once I switch to easy it became....easy....except last run.

Kanmusu who shines above all else in terms of performance. This could be just for one map or multiple maps.

It's Myoukou, hands down, Myoukou. Definitely not just for me, but for many other admirals out there too. Why? This image should suffice.

<p style="font-weight:normal;text-align:start;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Tanaka what the fuck were you thinking? Were you trap in a gangrape fest that thoroughly destroy your hole but resets and regenerate your hole every day for a month because that's what this event feels like. GG Tanaka, see you in Fall Event where it'll be easy as fuck because you need to caress us with your carrot before giving us the stick again later.</span></p>
