All of the runs E1- E3 runs are doable despite being expensive. But in this thread... I'm showing my Best shots while staying salty.

E-4 Run

Best Run:

[[File:NOOOO.png|thumb|400px|Just no.]]Seriously, Red T and in Easy... Sanity drained a lot after this.

Good News: I finished it a while ago,

Bad news: I spent at least 4000 worth of reso here alone. Same consumption when I cleared E1-3 All together. Buckets, 60+ in one Map.



I love you E-4. I'll forever be your slave. I'm not going to miss the two straight Yasen Nodes and definitely not going to miss Red BB Rus accurate shelling. Never ever. shall I step to your paltform and never ever shall be a victim of your Crappy Drops.



E-5 Run

Best Run: too boring, none manage to take my attention away.

E-6 Run:

Best run:

[[File:E-6_Maximum_salt_node..png|thumb|400px|I'll swear, I'll kill you next time we met.]]This is much sums up my best run for E-6. I mean, I really love CV hime, and this time she has an accuracy boost due to her fleet position.

I frigging love E-6. I don't mind sending 2 or 3 more of my ships to red unless I send you to the bottom of the abyss. Got It, I need to pass.

The good: Finally Finished after 11 runs [7 clears, 3 failed attempts and 1 pre boss retreat (ushio got Red)]... and a Hamakaze and Tanikaze drop.

The Bad: Low reso left after E-6. Damn, I had doubts I can clear the last map. Anti Air Princess has an absurd DEF. And to lower that defense I must kill FS of Nodes K,X and Y. X and Y are Installation bosses. I shouldn't underestimate her.



E-7:

Best run (so Far):

This is insane. This is frigging nuts, all the while I was wondering if there is a definitive route to this hellish map named E-7.It's like a zigzag of full turns. one wrong move you are sent home via Wo kai's takoyakis... or even node M which would be a bit easier than Node J... Danm, I am screwed and I only had 3000 worth of fuel left. Looks Like I won't be able to magnificently clear this frigging map. I should have stock up a bit. Not it feels too useless.
