For now, I won't write so much about the details behind it but special thanks goes to [[User:SydneyFFG03|SydneyFFG03]] for sending me this pre-built 1/700 Water Line Series No. 426 Akizuki by [[wikipedia:Aoshima Bunka Kyozai|Aoshima Bunka Kyozai]]. Needless to say is that this is my waifu in-game for Kantai Collection (KanColle). As I have received it on the same day as writing this article I am just tired of having stayed up literally all-night being unable to contain my excitement. Over time I will continue to try and update this blog entry in a bid to document it all but for now, enjoy the photos!
