==Helping out==
===Coding===
<div style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px;">
In coding KC3改, we mainly use JavaScript, and of course HTML/CSS. No special knowledge needed to contribute as long as we create solutions using the simple scripting that we all know and love. Even NodeJS is optional, and usually only used for checking small errors (JSHint) and building WebStore versions, which isn't required for you to know.

For interested contributors, you may visit [https://github.com/KC3Kai/KC3Kai our repository on GitHub] and fork it, or you may just join the [https://gitter.im/KC3Kai/Public Gitter chat] to talk on how to go about things. We're always welcome for new developers!

===Testing===
<div style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px;">
While we do not have a formal testing procedure, having people use the latest GitHub versions will at least give us hints if we did something wrong in our coding. It would be great to have more people seeing our latest work, before releasing to the WebStore, so that bugs may be detected beforehand.

To use the development version version, we have [https://github.com/KC3Kai/KC3Kai/wiki/Setup-development-build instructions over at GitHub] on how to do that. Advanced thank you to all those who are willing to become a tester of these versions. You could also ping us on any channel to let us know you are testing, and once you submit your first dev bug, we'll add you to the credits list!

===Translations===
<div style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px;">
We have a transaction procedure, and instructions on its own [https://github.com/KC3Kai/kc3-translations GitHub Repo]. There are two ways to go about, one involving git, and one manually. We put step-by-step instructions on the linked page, so be sure to check it out.
