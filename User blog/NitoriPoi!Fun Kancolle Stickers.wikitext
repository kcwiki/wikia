Hello fellow TTK!

I just launched a website making vinyl decals for putting on computers / cars / anything with a smooth flat surface (and no that's not an RJ joke).

My first 3 designs I'm stocking are Kancolle's Taiha / Chuuha / Shouha icons, and I wanted to share it with the wiki!~ I'm also going to be making "Poi" to stick places, but right now those are just prototypes. There's other anime related designs coming soon too. Also, I do custom requests and so if you've got a great idea for something, I'd love to hear it!Â  Check it out at [http://vodnik-decals.com vodnik-decals.com] ![[File:DSC_2907c.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Stickers from vodnik-decals.com]]
