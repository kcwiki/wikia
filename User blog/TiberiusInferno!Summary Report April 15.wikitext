Today was a long day. BUT with no school I've been able to complete more weeklies than I usually would have. I also have manged to level Akitsu Maru enough to remodel her, with Ooyodo following. I've been put down by three unsucessful LSC's, and the search for pyon is getting out of hand. It's almost a repeat of Isokaze... Almost. Anyways, More weeklies, and more levels. Still no progress on 5-3. That's on a hiatus.
