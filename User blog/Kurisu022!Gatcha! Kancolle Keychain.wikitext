So I'm currently living here on japan. While I'm buying stuff for my home, I saw this Kancolle gacha outside. 

Then I tried to spend 800￥ I've got 4 of these.  

[[File:131125_174545.jpg|thumb|2 shimakaze and 1 of the rest here.]]Apparently they have some AR code for a Smartphone application which you can use to put a picture of them.

Review: 

There are currently 8 of them available Includes Inazuma, Fubuki, Shimakaze, naka, Atago, Nagato, Kongou and Akagi.[[File:Keychain.png|thumb|＼ﾅｯｶﾘｰﾝ/]]

The size of the keychain is about 4cm in lenght, 3cm width and 5mm height.

The case is made of plastic but sturdy and I'm unable to split open the case.

The front of the picture is the illustration of the characters while the backside is a AR code.(I'll tell what the AR code's use later)

The only thing I hate on these are the ball-chains as most of them in my experience gets break while travelling, I'll be good for me if it's a strap as it can be also use as a cellphone strap.

The AR Code is used for an application called arガチャsound (ar gacha sound), this is available for both [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.takaratomy.argacha&hl=ja Android] and [https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/argachas/id640376977?mt=8 iOS] .

The application is a photo program which allows you to put a character while you shoot a still picture.

Use the Camera to scan the AR Code and I'll begin to download some file and your done.[[File:IMG_1318.jpg|thumb|It looks like that I have a shimakaze figure, but no..]]
