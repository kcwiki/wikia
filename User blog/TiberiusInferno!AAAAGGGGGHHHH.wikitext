I've been farming 1-5 for a bit. For Uzuki. For all of you that got three of her in one run, give one to me. Please. Please with a cherry on top? I haven't gotten even a peek of my pyon. That's all I want right now. Stockpiling resources vs. farming for Uzuki. That's been my dillemma (if that's how you spell it). Also, this is turning into a repeat of Isokaze.
