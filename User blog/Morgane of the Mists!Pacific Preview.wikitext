Yup, we're done! ''Pacific's ''headed out to print. I've got some preview pages coming up below, and we'll be making our debut at Shanghai on November 15th.

The cover's something you've all seen before.

<span style="font-family:sans-serif;">Table of contents. No mysteries, really. Sixteen girls plus one spread of design notes. Full color. We'd like to let you guys know exactly what's in the tin, so to speak. ;)</span>

As I said, Pacific is a character design book first and foremost. Using Helena as an example (Sorry, Northampton-chan is a bit too much of a badass and has expressed reservations in showing herself in an "unprepared" state). On the left-hand side, the page has a small bit of historical information - weapon loadouts and such. Much of this page is taken up by her character introduction, which is comprised of two parts. A first-person account (like a short story) of who she is, and an analysis by STEC - the Special Task and Evaluation Command, the organization responsible for bringing USN ship girls into existence in the first place - that gives you a "bird's eye" insight into her character. 

<span style="font-family:sans-serif;">Across the page we have four voice lines (all we can realistically fit) for her and of course, her art. We also have a small design notes section across the page where the three of us comment briefly on the process in which we went about making each ship girl in the first place, and whatever trivia we can fit that'll help you understand her better. For instance, why is Shaw so sweet? Well, part of her inspiration comes from the account of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan), whose glowing remarks on how kind and generous the sailors and marines of Shaw was to everyone - not just himself - in a series of his letters to his friends and family when serving as a war correspondent aboard the Shaw.</span>

<span style="font-family:sans-serif;">And, of course, we've got an author's note page, and a page of more trivia below. This includes our world design, misc, notes. Other bits of history that we couldn't fit in. Something on Maury, etc.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13.3333330154419px;line-height:normal;">For anyone that's pre-ordered the physical copy before November 14-15th, we'll likely be able to ship these out before ComicUp!, which is where </span>Pacific <span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13.3333330154419px;line-height:normal;">will be making its first physical premiere. We won't get a physical slot invitation/information until about the weekend before, but we'll have more information as time goes by. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13.3333330154419px;line-height:normal;">Yeah, it's been a long and exhausting weekend, but it's finished. Thank you all for your words of encouragement and support - couldn't have happened without you!</span>
