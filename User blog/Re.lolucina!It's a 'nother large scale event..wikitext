[[File:14.5.18.jpg|thumb|400px]] 
It's event season again, and if you guys don't mind, could you please give some tips on my ship list? I'm trying to K2 my DDs and CAs.
I don't really try to run things above Easy because I scream and cry easily. Maybe, if there's a good ship you can get on the higher levels I ''might'' shoot for it, but seeing as most of my ships are somewhat leveled, I usually don't.[[File:14.5.18.equipment.jpg|thumb|400px]]


About the equiment: I also have a special onigiri(SHRIMPLESS!), a few drums,  and a Shiden Model 11(LBAS).
I'm trying to build more LBAS planes, but are there any ships & equipment I should try to build/get?
Thanks!
