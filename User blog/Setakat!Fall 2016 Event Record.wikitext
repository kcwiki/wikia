==Personal Opinion==
'''E1:''' Return of [[Submarine Princess]]. Map took a few more runs than I would have liked, but devs gave us line ahead opening torpedoes, which meant a few B and C ranks here. 58 TP per A rank.

'''E2:'''

'''E3:'''

'''E4:''' I despise [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class Kai Flagship|aimbot Wo]] and her fellow numbers. She has only 2 attacks: 'Instant Taiha' or 'Rarely miss', with a very strong preference for the former. Got sick and tired of having to retreat a J/H, and ended up dropping the difficulty to easy just so I didn't have to deal with her until Final Kill.

'''E5:''' Return of [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class Kai Flagship|aimbot Wo]]. Fortunately she seems to have forgotten how to aim. Maybe 12 ships is confusing for her? Completed on easy as I'd had enough of the event thanks to E4 and my messup with E3.
