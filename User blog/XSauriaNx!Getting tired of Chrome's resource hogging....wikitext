So yeah. As you can notice in the title, Chrome as a browser is too much of a resource hogging software and completely slows down my totally old Acer Travelmate laptop.

So I had a question, "Why not try playing KC with KC3 Kai in another browser?"

KC3 Kai has been an important thing for me to use when playing KC. I used to play KC with KCViewer but kinda got dissatisfied with it at some point so I switched... xD

Then I started my with my experiment with other browser. Of course you can play in another browser but there'll be some ''"drawbacks"Â ''I think.

This blog post will be an updating diary of mine in to know what browsers:

'''Week 1:'''

Will keep on observing for any anomaly that might occur... xD
