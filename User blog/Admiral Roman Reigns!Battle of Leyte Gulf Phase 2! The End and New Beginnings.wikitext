After Last Dance

Abyssal Zuikaku out of rage, charges at Zuihou with her rustic samurai Abyssal sword. Zuikaku pushes Zuihou away and counters. Sword fight ensues[[File:You_did_good.jpg|thumb|384px]]
*minutes later* Swords fly off,  Hand-to-hand. Then 
*grabs sword* Ahhhh *stab* 
Abyssal Zuikaku says her final sinking line while pulling out Zuikaku's sword. After her last word, gives it to her and faints on her...

"You'd done enough...*cries*  It's over...you can rest now..."

"*last breath's*"

Kaga and Shoukaku come close to Zuikaku and her Abyssal counterpart... Kaga picks up and gives Abyssal Zuikaku's sword and Zuikaku puts in on her chest while Abyssal Zui holds it..

"*sees Kaga and Zuikaku* they...live...."

"*still crying* yes..." All three hold Abyssal Zuikaku's hand "I'll protect them and cheerish every moment with them and the others... in this new life..."

'Hehe.. *begins to dissapear* then I am  satisfied..... thank you *touches Zuikaku's chest where her heart is*"

"Mission accomplish.... *breathe* Zuikaku.."

"Yeah..." 

"Listen... I'll go ahead back at base with the new member I rescued. You on the other hand... take your time ... cheerish this moment with everyone involved...  you all deserve that victory... Admiral out..."
