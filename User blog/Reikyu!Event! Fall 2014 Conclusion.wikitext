Overall a very successful run.  Picked up every single ship that I didn't have that dropped with the exception of Noshiro.

Starting Resources:

71.5k {{fuel}}, 47k {{ammo}}, 42.2k {{steel}}, 38.4k {{bauxite}}, ~980 buckets

E-4 cleared within 24 hours of playing.  Net resource use:

16.7k {{fuel}}, 17.5k {{ammo}}, 7k {{steel}}, 1.5k {{bauxite}}, ~140 buckets



E-1 went smoothly with 4 runs for 4 kills.

E-2 started smoothly then quickly went downhill from tsu, random CA hits, random NB hits, and final form being pain.  Took roughly 12 attempts.

E-3 went pretty well as I had akitsumaru and 3 CLT available.  Sent back about 4 times and only failed a clean kill once.

E-4 also went pretty well.  Sent back about half a dozen times or so and one shot the final form.



Thus began E-5, the true boss of the event.

Asagumo required around 20 E-2 runs.

In celebration of event 4 LSCs were done (1 BB, 3 CV attempts), and finally nabbed Taihou.

Then began 3 days of E-1 farming with the only needed drop being an Urakaze.  A ridiculous number of Yuugumo, Fubuki, and a sadly unneeded Taigei.

Seeing no hope in Akashi dropping in E-1, began 2+ days of farming 1-5 in hopes of the elusive second Akashi.  After about 70 runs of 1-5 she finally dropped. 

With that done, attention shifted back to E-2 for the elusive Naganami.  Day before the event ends and she drops!

And then soon after on E-3 a Mikuma to replace the one I scrapped a while ago (after grabbing her gun of course) dropped.



My large stash of fuel and ammo hit dry on the 9th day.  Those combined fleets and/or boss support really cost a lot.  I end the event with a net loss of around ~650 buckets and my resources recovered to the 10-20k range.
