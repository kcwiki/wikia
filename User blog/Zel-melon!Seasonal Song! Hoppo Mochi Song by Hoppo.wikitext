<font size = 3>'''"Mochi"''' </font>

[Repeat x2]<br />
My mochi brings all the girls to the yard,<br />
And they're like<br />
It's better be ours,<br />
Damn right it's better be yours,<br />
I can give you,<br />
But I have to charge<br />
<br />
I know you want it,<br />
The thing that makes me,<br />
What those guys go crazy for.<br />
They lose their minds,<br />
I open wide,<br />
I think its time<br />
<br />
[Chorus x2]<br />
La la-la la la,<br />
Eat it up.<br />
Lala-lalala,<br />
The girls are crying<br />
<br />
My mochi brings all the girls to the yard,<br />
And they're like<br />
It's better be ours,<br />
Damn right it's better be yours,<br />
I can give you,<br />
But I have to charge<br />
<br />
I can see you're on it,<br />
You want me to give thee<br />
Mochis that freaks those boys,<br />
It can't be give,<br />
Just know, thieves get caught,<br />
Now go away,<br />
<br />
[Chorus x2]<br />
La la-la la la,<br />
Eat it up.<br />
Lala-lalala,<br />
The girls are crying<br />
<br />
My mochi brings all the girls to the yard,<br />
And they're like<br />
It's better be ours,<br />
Damn right it's better be yours,<br />
I can give you,<br />
But I have to charge<br />
<br />
Oh, once I get involved,<br />
Everyone will look this way-so,<br />
I must maintain my charm,<br />
Same time maintain my mochi,<br />
Just get one perfect hit,<br />
Then all his girls retreat,<br />
Then next his eyes are squint,<br />
Then he cry and I win,<br />
<br />
[Chorus x2]<br />
La la-la la la,<br />
Eat it up.<br />
Lala-lalala,<br />
The girls are crying<br />
<br />
My mochi brings all the girls to the yard,<br />
And they're like<br />
It's better be ours,<br />
Damn right it's better be yours,<br />
I can give you,<br />
But I have to charge<br />
<br />
