We need admin rights to change this orange template (as well as some other settings) but the founder [[user:Lycoris Aura]] (and the only admin) is inactive and no respond until today, i have posted an adoption request [http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Adoption:Kancolle_Wiki] but they said this wiki is too new and cannot add admin rights until 18 Sep and i need to make a discussion like this. Although i am after the admin rights now but if you are interest you can ask for it too, we just need someone be admin to change setting. If you have any idea please reply here, you can make your signature with <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> at the end of your post. [[User:CDRW|CDRW]] ([[User talk:CDRW|talk]]) 04:57, September 6, 2013 (UTC)
