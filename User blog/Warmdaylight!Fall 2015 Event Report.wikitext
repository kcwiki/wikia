Everything is started from soft cap. of 25,000 (from admiral lv. 97) and almost 500 buckets.

Due to lots of stress I had, and some bunch of salts from last time, I have stopped for a month just to take a break. My fleet was frozen in time for a month without leveling, quest, or that fishing mini-event thing. Since, my study was not that stressful at the time. I came back and found out about this event still undergoing. I have been talking with my friend who is also playing this game as well. I told him I was not planning to participate in this event. But then,

On Nov. 25, my ships was deployed in E-1. The difficulty was set to easy then by judging from their performance, difficulty was changed to hard. 

The next day, nov. 26. the fleet was then deployed to E-2. This time, the difficulty was set to easy and remained that way. I don't have much resources to compensate fail runs.

Nov. 27, my fleet was sortieing at E-3. Again to save resources, it was set to easy once more. From summer event salt, Akizuki was the first priority above all; she is needed more than Hagikaze or even those germans ships. After the map is cleared, as she had not yet appeared, I have to stayed there farming with this limited resources I have. 

Akisuki appeared ~ 30 runs later.  

While Farming for that anti-air destroyer, I deployed my fleet to E-4 to evaluate likeliness of clearing the map. It turns out the fleet is capable to clear but it has only 1 downside of resources consumption of 500 fuel/ run which is unacceptable. after Akizuki appearance, despite Akashi is next on the list. I proceed to E-4. Went to Node M serval times (~20 times, that's all I can afford), to the boss 8-9 times. I managed to get the german CV but no german CA to be seen. I decided to move on to the forbidden territory which I firstly swear I never ever enter.  

E-5 was cleared on normal on Dec. 6, 2015.....
