==Prologue:==

I woke up today only to find the sleeping face of Kasumi reflected on the mirror inside my room. While I do not mind seeing this every day, I wonder if she minds it if I tell her what she looks like when she is sleeping. Well, it’s not that she didn’t know that truth anyways; it’s just that maybe she hasn’t accepted it at all.

Anyways, I immediately get out of the bed and measure Kasumi’s uniform to visualize myself wearing one because I am envious of them who got to wear it while I still retain my childish uniform that doesn’t make me anything special at all. Oh right, I haven’t introduced myself; I am Arare and I am the leader of the Expedition team.

Unlike the main fleet who does it’s work by destroying enemies upon sight, the Expedition team is a specialized team that is only sent to collect resources and do some offensive support. But in our case, we are mostly used for resource gathering and the Admiral has made a different team made for Offensive Support.

Anyways, I am one of the oldest ships around the block which pretty much tells of how experienced I am in terms of transport work and loading and unloading resources. As a matter of fact, I haven’t been able to go actual combat for quite some time and I feel that my ability to defeat the enemies has already depreciated as of late.

But nonetheless, the Admiral has put his trust on me and I will never fail him for as long as I live.

==<br />Memories==

While I am nothing more than a transport ship on the sea, on land… I was totally unparalleled because I have learned the art of fighting when I was 6. On the other hand, because of that; after obtaining this power, I never have anyone I can call friends back at home and because of that, I am nothing more but a living monster.

But, one boy didn’t falter when he first met me. And at that time… He is the only one I can totally call my friend up to this point of time. Who he is? Of course, the answer to that is the Admiral.

The Admiral; or also known as Hiro, who happened to be my only childhood friend, was the only person who didn’t feel afraid when I am around. As a matter of fact, he considered me as someone strong and can be depend upon. And thus, with that I became friends with him.

But one winter morning, Hiro and I found ourselves stranded in the middle of the mountain to where blizzards is a norm around these parts. But even with that, Hiro and I have slowly managed to descend the mountains and met with our first teacher who taught us how to live and how to fight. And every single day of our training, Hiro and I have hone our skills to make sure we will survive the world no matter what happens.

But even with our skills have totally made us totally strong, we are nothing more than just kids. Even I was a kid back then; I just happened to have monstrous strength which didn’t fit my persona. But even so, we really strive hard to make it out of the mountains before the year comes to an end.

On our way to the base of the mountains, we were greeted my sister who is just a year older than me and the three of us continued hiking down the mountains.

My sister who happens to know where we are, decided to go and fetch for me even though our parents didn’t agree to that, but even so; she reluctantly went off on her own and made her way through the treacherous paths so that she can retrieve us. With that, I am truly thankful for her but…

A gun shot ended my big sister’s life.

The man who kidnapped me, and happened to accidentally pull Hiro too has been waiting for us at the base of the mountain as he heard the news that two kids have managed to go down from the mountains with a guide of some adult. And thus, he decided to make sure we can’t make it back alive, he decided to take our lives with his own hands.

With my sister finally gone, I can’t move since the gun was totally aimed at me. But, even so…

“No need for you to worry A-chan.”

As Hiro-said those words, the man who had the gun groaned in pain as he delivered multiple palm strikes to his body and after that, he tied up the said man and he left him there to die. Hiro did also bury my sister’s body so that she can finally rest.

After that, Hiro and I continued hiking down until we finally reach home.

After that…

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Huh?”

I woke up from my daze as Sendai poked me at the cheek.

“You seem to be comfortable enough to sleep while standing.”<br />“I just had a dream about the past.”<br />“What kind of past? The tragic one or…”<br />“My past has always been so tragic. But one part of that past is the best memory I had.”<br />“I don’t really want to pry into your past but what was that good part?”<br />“It’s the time when I met and became friends with the Admiral.”<br />“That part… But everyone would say that anyways.”<br />“That’s true. But I was not referring my meeting with him at this naval base. I was referring to the time meet him during my childhood days.”<br />“Childhood… Naka has that same notion too, though her story is pretty short.”<br />“I guess memories is something we really hold dear if we experience good times.”<br />“But, in the end… memories are just a fragment of the past. What matters now is the present.”<br />“I know that… that’s why…”

Unable to say it to Sendai’s face, I decided to keep my mouth shut as I continue riding the waves.

“I wonder if he still knows my real name.”

I whispered these words underneath my breath as I slowly see the naval base appearing on our sights. And with that, our expedition for that part is almost close to complete.<br />�

==Wishes==

After we have unloaded the fruits of our expedition, the Admiral greeted us and he said that we can take a bit of rest before heading back. From the looks of things, he seems to be preparing over something big. Anyways, I have reported everything we have passed over the past few days and he nonchalantly pat my head praising my efforts.

“By the way Onii- I mean… Admiral, Are the preparations close to be completed?”<br />“Prep work can never be completed. But I can much say that we are 85% ready.”<br />“Is that so?”<br />“There are always uncertainties in the ocean as for no matter how much we prepare for everything, it always bites back to us knowing that we haven’t done enough to compromise with the growing disparity of the enemy fleet.”<br />With those words, All I can conclude is that preparations are always hard for those who don’t take it too seriously. In the Admiral’s case, he himself doesn’t take preparations seriously.

“Arare, is there something wrong?”<br />“why do you ask?”<br />“Nothing really. But I can feel that you are thinking deeply as of the moment.”<br />“Oh. Sorry to make you worry. I am fine because that’s the way it is.”<br />“If you say so…”<br />“Anyways, I have to take my break then.”<br />“See you later then.”<br />“Alright.”<br />And I excused myself from the Admiral as I walk towards out of the resource room. For me, this alone should be fine and I should not want anything more than what I have in this moment.

As soon as I have arrived at the mess hall, I was greeted by Sendai who seemed to be a bit full of energy, far from the usual Sendai who loves the night.<br />“Hey, what happened?”<br />“Nothing much. Asides, you are quite lively considering it’s still daytime.”<br />“The time of the day doesn’t mean anything at all to me. Anyways, that serious look on your face tells me nothing much has changed.”<br />“Then I have nothing to say then.”<br />“But Kiddo, are you sure you want things to end like this?”<br />“What do you mean?”<br />“I don’t mean to say to you but, haven’t you been too passive? I know you are strong but… How the hell you stay passive despite this advantage? You were his first friend, you have moments together too, he saw you cry too and he even did promise you. WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST 2 AND A HALF YEARS?”<br />“I…”<br />“ARARE, JUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND ALREADY!”<br /><br />As Sendai slams the table, she left and grumpily walks outside while the rest are watching us from a distance. Soon, they resumed eating as if nothing has happened at all. For some reason, Sendai’s mood is quite volatile as if someone has been undergoing her period. After finishing my meal, I resumed with the expedition work and for some reason, Sendai-san didn’t speak to me all throughout the course of the expedition.

After that, I was greeted once again by the Admiral who looked quite serious.

“Is there a matter?”<br />“Nothing at all. I just thought that this should be enough for today.”<br />“That’s quite enough for now. I don’t want you guys to feel that I am enslaving you folks to make some rounds; Asides, I’ll get sad if an accident happens because I work you folks to the core.”<br />“I see.”

I felt that I should do something at that moment, but even so I remember that I shouldn’t do much but as I think of those thoughts, Sendai’s lecture comes to mind as I hesitate.

Slowly, I reached out at his available hand and I held it with my right hand. The Admiral didn’t show his surprise and he welcomed it by interlocking his fingers into mine.

“It’s quite rare for you to hold my hand. Is there something that bothers you?”

As I try to mince out my words, I can feel the warmth that flows through my hand as I continue to hold his.

“Admiral, why am I such an idiot? I have known you for quite so long, I have been friends with you long before you met the rest, we have overcome an obstacle together and together, we mourn over someone’s loss and to top of it all…”<br />“I made a promise with you. The very first promise I made to a girl…”<br />“!!!”

I was surprised to hear those words the Admiral has said to me. After all, I have thought that he has already forgotten about it.

“My Promise back when we are kids is that, when we meet each other again, I’ll make sure that you’ll never cry anymore. But, it really is hard to fulfil that promise if that person doesn’t cry anymore so, to add to that promise; Arare, I promise you that you’ll never cry anymore and assure you that you’ll be happy for the rest of your life.”

I laughed as the Admiral said those words. For some reason, I have already believed that he has forgotten everything about that promise so I was sure that he won’t bother me anymore but, he has surprised me that he can still remember it… and to top it all, now wants to make me happy for the rest of my life. I don’t even know where I should start at this point anymore…

“Is it lame? I knew it…”<br />“No Admiral. You can never be lame to my eyes… After all, you are my one and only hero who have come to aid this strong princess.”<br />“I am not a hero, I am just your friend.”

For some reason, I felt that I don’t want our talk to end at this note. So, I muster additional courage and come and face him not as someone who have known him for quite so long, but also as a woman who wanted to get what she wants.

“Onii- No, this time; I have to clearly state this as myself. Hiro, I know that you treasure our friendship above else but I must say this to you so that my heart won’t be forever torn with my indecisions so… Hiro, I love you. I want to be happy at your side and think of me more than just a friend.”

Soon, the Admiral lets go of my hand and instead, he placed his hand on my face as if he wants to do something.

“Arare, I am happy to hear that. Finally, I finally have heard your thoughts since I can’t force my feelings to you.”<br />“Eh? Why?”<br />“Because I was thinking what if you don’t like me. Our friendship might come to an end and I cherish that friendship of ours too. So, you don’t have to worry about breaking our status quo.”<br />“I see. Anyways, I am now confused if I should call you by your name or by what I usually call you…”<br />“Well, you can call me by my name whenever we are alone. And call me onii-chan on times that you feel that you want me to call that… after all, it is music to my ears. But at work; our respective roles must be observed.”<br />“Understood Onii-chan. I prefer calling you this way too, your name sounds too serious.”<br />“But I was being serious here…”<br />“But I have been always serious about you, Onii-chan.”

And with that, the Admiral initiated in kissing me on my lips and I reciprocated it by kissing him back.<br />It was already evening but the Admiral felt that the night is still young for the two of us, so he decided to carry me to the hidden room and there I let him do whatever he wants to my body.<br />�

==Epilogue:==

The epilogue or what onii-chan called the punchline of this story…<br />I wake up the next morning and I saw the Admiral sleeping beside me holding my hand. Last night, the two of us have messed one another until we have reached the peak of our youth. But even so, I can still feel the lingering effects of what happened that night.<br />I removed my hand and rose from the bed to prepare myself for the morning ahead. After the preparations has been completed, I was greeted by the Admiral who just woke up.

“You’re going already?”<br />“Sadly, my work time is different from yours, so I’ll have to take my early leave today.”<br />“I see. Arare, thanks for listening to my selfish demands.”<br />“It’s fine. After all, I will gladly comply to your needs. Onii-chan, I think I can now say that I am happy.”<br />“Then it’s good. See you later then.”<br />“Alright.”

And so, I exit the room and was greeted by Sazanami who was standing outside.<br />“Congratulations. But next time, ask for my permission.”<br />“I will. Now, if you excuse me…”<br />But before I can take my leave, Sazanami held my hand.

“Arare… Let me be your friend too, Hearing my Master’s story about you… I can’t help but think that we are on the same boat.”<br />“!!!”

And I guess I have gained a new friend after that.

End.
