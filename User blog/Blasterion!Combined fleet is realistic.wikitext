Today after clearing E-3 I came to a realization at how realistic the combined fleet is to real naval operations. After a heart pounding clean kill on the E-3 boss where the main fleet did absolutely nothing and the shelling support did absolutely nothing, I came to a realization, isn't this how the Navy always been? The main fleet is just like the officers, who kind of sit on their ass and don't do work and hand it off to the enlisted peeps (DDs/CLs). Then the enlisted has to catch up on the work and work extra hours (hence the Yasen) to make up for the work that wasn't done.



I hereby conclude that Kancolle is a realistic simulator to actual naval operations.
