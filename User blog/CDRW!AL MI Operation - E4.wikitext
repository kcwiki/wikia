==1st part==

No video this time, before starting E4 you need some changes to your E3 fleet :<br />1) Replace one of your CV to CVL, and reassign the aircraft because the aerial power demand is lower than E3 (calculator here : http://www.kancolle-calc.net/aircrafts.html ) which is under 300.<br />2) Rumors from other boards suggest 4DD in the combined fleet (1 in 1st and 3 in 2nd fleet, or 4 in 2nd fleet) you may replace one of your CA in 2nd fleet with DD, and in order to reduce risk in submarine node, replace your DD's RADAR to SONAR/depth charge.<br />3) All of your BB and CA must equip with type 3 ammo, and no torpedo attack can hit midway boss.<br />
Setup example : 1st fleet : 1CVL 2BB 3CV ; 2nd fleet 1CL 4DD 1CA<br />
All white nodes in the map are empty, except C and H. C is a submarine node, and H is a day battle node like the one you encounter in E3 (and E4) boss, IMO H is the most dangerous pre boss node. Pick 1st formation in node C, 4th formation for H and K (boss), and 3rd formation in the aerial battle nodes.<br />
CVL will greatly reduce or eliminated the chance to dead end, but other branching rules are not clear yet, with above setup you will always run B C F J K
