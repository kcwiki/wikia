'''Asshole Guide for doing the Airraid annoying Perfect health no-dmg spam for low cost'''


Below is an example (I ran out of trash ship): Basically, throw in enough ship to fir the minimum requirement for an STF fleet. Add in one submarine to make it slow fleet. Done. Send them out and they'll go to sub node then air attack node. Those two doesn't do that much dmg and sometimes you'll get lucky and they survive. If they survive, good, use them for next sortie. If you want to push your luck go three node back to C and get rekt.

Good - You get to spam shit, doesn't count that much

Bad - You look like an asshole, you'll go insane for sorting so many ass time just for a chance to get airraid on the 2nd node. That fucking Airfield will still hit you even if you go full defense.

Note: I'm tired and sanity is low. This guide doesn't make sense.

'''Asshole Guide to raising Plane Proficiency'''

Feels like your Defenders are still shitty against air raid? Want to raise their proficiency? Use this same method and just send those planes to E-2 node D or A. Who to send it out with? Your trash DD that you'll scrap anyways (1 DD fleet goes to C). Let her take all the hits, but the planes will still fly. They'll get rank. Your ship get rekt but it doesn't matter much. Get enough proficiency as test your luck against that Air raid again.

On the other hand. You can do it in E-3. For some weird reason, even though it is a sub node there is still chance that your LBAS will lose plane. Weird huh? However, you send more ship. But it's subs....but it's combined fleet....so have quite a number of scrub ships to scrap and you're fine.
