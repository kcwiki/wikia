here is a log of me grinding 3-2A thru out the day

Ungrinded Named squadrons start off with veteran status (1 to 2 bars), unknown if they go any lower




Update: 1 x 3-2A run Hiryuu MVP Suisei(Egusa) promoted to 3bars

Update2: 2 x 3-2A run Hiryuu MVP, no change

Update3: Stripped Hiryuu down, moved squadrons to Houshou, all squadrons retained exp. Plane status is plane bound not carrier bound

Update4: Seaplanes can be promoted

Update6: 3 Blue striped => 1 Yellow stripe

Update7: 2 Yellow stripes

Update8: 3 Yellows

Update9: 3 Yellow stripes turned into 2 yellow chevrons

Update10: Suisei (Egusa) randomly lost all levels no AA encountered, promotion loss unexplained

__________________________

Blue Bars 1,2,3 then Yellow Stripes 1,2,3 the I got up to 2 Yellow Chevrons before giving up because Suisei Egusa got wiped
