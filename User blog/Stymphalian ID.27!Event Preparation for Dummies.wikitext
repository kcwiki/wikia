===Introdution===
This is meant to be a small checklist for newer admirals who just want to know if they are good enough for the next event, Summer 2015.

If you want a good, detailed guide, [[User blog:Shinhwalee/Major_Event_Preparation_Guide_for_Admirals_(OUTDATED)|Major_Event_Preparation_Guide_for_Admirals by Shinhwalee]] is here. You can think this blog as a tl;dr version of that :v. 
===How many of each type should I have?===
Destroyer (DD): 4-5 will be enough for everything, all of them will be used in E-1, from E-2 to the end, you will normally use 2 DD at most, sometime none at all. Recommend to have 6 ready.

Light Cruiser (CL): 1. They are used for [[Combined_Fleet]] mostly, you may prepare 2-3 CL for E-1 if you want.

Torpedo Cruiser (CLT): As many as you can, it is possible to pass events with only 1 CLT but it gonna be hard for you, trust me, i tried.

Heavy Cruiser (CA) and Aviation Cruiser (CAV): 3-5, with at least 1 CAV for routing

Battleship (BB): 4-5, up to 9 for that sweet support expedition.

Carriers (CV/CVL): confirmed to be important for the next event by the devolopers (silly them, all girls are important), you would need at least 4 CV/CVL ready, recommend to have 8, for support expedition.
===Which ship should I pick?===
Which ever you like. If you want to pick them by their stat, Shinhwalee's guide explain that already. :v
===Level?===

30 will be enough to pass Easy mode quite...easily. It's also possible to pass Medium

 at that level, too, 

if RNG is on your side. 50 is the safe mark if your luck is bad.

Here is what I have when I cleared Winter 2015

===Resource?===
Almost any amount is good, but, since everybody is scared of this part, I will give you a "safe" number.

[[File:1_-_Resource_before_the_event.jpg|thumb|left|My resource before the event]][[File:2_-_Resource_after_the_event.jpg|thumb|My resource after the event]]

Fuel: 10.000
Ammo: 10.000

Steel: 12.000

Bauxite: 8.000

Bucket: 100

Or about HQ level 37 softcap.
Why is it so low? Because you will have 2-3 weeks to clear the event. Assume that you do no expedition, no quest, you will regen a total of 30.000 fuel/ammo/steel and 10.000 baux during the event. Which equal to about 120 full run with BB and CV (and your baux won't even decrease enough to notice).
===Conlusion===
Nothing much to say, all you got to do is believe, not in yourself, but in the me that believe in you. :v

If you have question, [[Board:Fleet%27s_Prepared-ness]] is your friend, or you could post question here.

Last and most important: Good RNG everybody o7.

===The little to do list===
1. Get my [insert DD no.1 here] to level 30
: 1b. Get my [insert DD no.1 here] to level 50

 2. Get my [insert DD no.2 here] to level 30

: 2b. etc. etc.

9001. 2 days before event start,make sure my resource is over 9000 and my buckets are 3 digits.
