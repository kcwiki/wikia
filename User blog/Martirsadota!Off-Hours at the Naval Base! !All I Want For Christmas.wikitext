Only today did I get to fill in the rest of the lines (mostly unmodified, anyway, from the original) and post it here.<br/><br/>No hate here, really; just miffed that it's the same girls over and over again. Don't get me wrong; I perfectly know the circumstances, but hey, a man can dream, can't he?''</div>

I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
There is just one one thing I need<br/>
I don't care about the 7thDesDiv<br/>
Getting all the good CG<br/>
<br/>
I just want one for my own<br/>
More than you could ever know<br/>
Make my wish come true<br/>
Draw me some Christmas CG, Shibafu<br/>
<br/>
I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
There is just one thing I need<br/>
(And I) don't care about [[Yuudachi]]<br/>
Her sisters or the 6thDesDiv<br/>
<br/>
I just want to stop my wishing<br/>
She'll come dressed to my naval base<br/>
Kadokawa won't make me happy<br/>
With [[Tanikaze]] on Christmas Day<br/>
<br/>
I just want one for my own<br/>
More than you could ever know<br/>
Make my wish come true<br/>
Draw me some Christmas CG, Shibafu<br/>
<br/>
(oooh, baby)<br/>
<br/>
(Oh,) I won't ask for much this Christmas<br/>
<span style="border-bottom:2px dotted gray;" title="This is probably why she doesn't drop for me at all :(">I won't ask for [[Ooyodo]]</span><br/>
(And I'm) just wishing hard for something<br/>
That is not a Kagerou<br/>
<br/>
Why's the list of girls with CGs<br/>
Just the same each passing year?<br/>
I won't even stay awake<br/>
To read all of the patch note tweets<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I just want her here tonight<br/>
All decked out in red and white<br/>
What more can I do?<br/>
(Oh, baby) Draw me some Christmas CG, Shibafu<br/>
<br/>
All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere<br/>
And the sound of shipgirls' laughter fills the air<br/>
And everyone is singing<br/>
I hear those sleigh bells ringing<br/>
Shibafu, please bring me<br/>
[[Fubuki|The one I really need]]<br/>
Won't you please draw my baby for me, quickly<br/>
<br/>
I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
This is all I'm asking for<br/>
I just wanna see my baby<br/>
Dressed and waiting at my door<br/>
<br/>
I just want one for my own<br/>
More than you could ever know<br/>
Make my wish come true<br/>
(Oh, baby) Draw me some Christmas CG, Shibafu (oooh, baby)<br/>
<br/>
Draw me some Christmas CG, Shibafu (baby)<br/>
