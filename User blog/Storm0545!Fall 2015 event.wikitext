I had a goal of clearing the event on easy at a minimum and I have happily achieved that goal. I started off on E1 hard and it wasn't actually too bad but the game lured me into a false sense of security as E2 and beyond was hell for my ignored DDs so I was forced to finish out the event on easy. But, not all is without reward I even snagged 3 of the 4 reward ships as of writing this with arashi still trapped somewhere in e5 waiting for me to deftly avoid the pt salt sticks and punch the destroyer demon in the face a few more times to get her. Prinz, U-511,Â  the mafia and Akizuki are still there in their respective maps but with my resources being in the state that they're in and finals rolling around the corner after this holiday I'm happy just trying to snag arashi off e5 with the last of my buckets and hanging up the reigns back to my expedition fleets.

Overall I enjoyed the challenge for my combined fleets and the lessons learned from it on the perils of ignoring leveling the dds and cls of my fleet in favor of the big and user friendly capital ships. The 1st major lesson to be learned was the Abukuma that I have sitting at level 2 needs to promptly start taking her pvp supplements and getting turned into her kai-ni for future events. The second, widely learned lesson is my dd fleet needs to hit up 4-3 a bit more so i can at least kai ni shigure and a few others that saw some use and leveled up quite a bit from level 20 in this event while also leveling the other dds i have since it seems the devs like to throw us curve balls with random mutsuki class and beyond dds needed for branching.

In closing expedition 2, 5 and 21 are about to become best friends with me while kashima graf and the crew start gearing up for their training montage in pvp and their respective leveling maps. [[File:UrlhU1X.jpg|thumb|232px]]
