4th event attempted.

''If the Abyssal's can constantly supply enough forces to reoccupy an area between sorties, why haven't they conquered the land yet? Especially when they can provide 5 new Hime's per sortie?''

Nice short event with probably the best rewards event I've received since [[Spring 2015 Event|Spring]]. And also had the right drops to fill in some empty spaces in the Kandex as well.

Aiming to obtain [[Hatsuzuki]] and [[Zara]]. Also aiming to find [[Mizuho]], [[Amagi]], [[Akitsushima]] and [[Prinz Eugen]].

==E1 - 'Operation Rei-Go' Preparation==

{{Progress|100|Starting Sanity}}
Cleared on hard, primarily because I wanted the [[16inch Triple Gun Mount Mk.7]]. This map was almost forgettable, and the only reason it isn't is because of the Error Cat that appeared after a successful final kill, so I had to sortie for the final kill again. Obtained my E1 goal of [[Mizuho]] and also found [[Asashimo]] as well. Not much to note here, apart from the amount of [[Hyuuga]]'s I found.

7 runs all up, all S ranks (would have S ranked #6 and completed the map, damn you Error Cat).

Onwards to E2.

==E2 - Sortie! 'Operation Rei-Go'==
[[File:EventMedal-Normal.png|right]]
{{Progress|95|Starting Sanity}}
After a bit of discussion and deliberation regarding the rewards, decided to clear on Medium/Normal. The reward for hard isn't really worth the trouble apart from bragging rights, and the rest of the good stuff is in E3, so I was more motivated to clear E2, snag the Medium difficult rewards, and head on over to E3.

Initial farming fleet had trouble with node L, so changed to a heavier fleet that went via the south route. Personally, the south route seemed to preform better than the north, but had to deal with node G, especially when the [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class|Wo-Class Kai Flagship]] decided to show (which only happened 3 times)

I recommend the south route with 2DD2CA(V)1FBB1CV(B). Constant C-G-K-N-O routing, and gets to the boss with ammo to boot. [[Maya|Maya Kai Ni]] specced with nighttime DA, her weaker AA setup and a Type 3 shell, or an DD for AACI will shut down the boss nicely if triggered. Going with CAV over CA allows you to bring a Seaplane bomber for extra AS and a bit of extra damage on the opening airstrike as well as helping out in C. If you have a [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]], bringing along a high FP destroyer such as [[Yuudachi|Yuudachi Kai Ni]] or [[Ayanami|Ayanami Kai Ni]] will result in lots of installation destruction goodness. Yuudachi was more than capable of killing the [[Supply Depot Princess]] during Yasen with them.

Farming: 21 runs North, 13 Boss encounters and Kills. 12 runs South, 9 Boss encounters, 8 Boss Kills<br />
Clearance: 8 runs South, 6 Boss encounters and Kills.

==E3 - Shou 4th Battle Operation==
[[File:EventMedal-Normal.png|right]]
{{Progress|80|Starting Sanity}}
Still don't like Transport Combined Fleet. Routing this time meant having to rely on CAV's with their small bomber slots to provide AS for the boss, which the [[Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|Tsu]] seems to be more than capable of emptying before you get there. I believe they do have AACI, but instead of applying to all incoming bombers like our AACI, it gets applied to 1 or more stacks. Only reason I have for why [[Tone]] will have her 9 slot emptied while [[Kumano]]/[[Mikuma]] have their 5 and 6 slots untouched.

The accuracy penalty that gets dished out when in combined fleet to both sides sure doesn't seem to apply when the closing torpedoes start flying. And the [[Submarine So-Class|So-Class Flagship's]] need to have their aimbots removed. I'm sure that their formations weren't Line Ahead.

Boss Phase was annoying. Chose to go to K at J since it had fewer encounters and no aimbot subs. However I had to put up with a [[Battleship Princess]] or two who seemed to take great pleasure in smacking my fleet around, forcing an early retreat. Boss was manageable prefinal with a rather easy S rank assuming I got past K, final form got noticably tougher with 2 [[Battleship Princess]] escorting her. Cleared Normal, as I'm not yet insane enough to try hard for the A-Class Medal; the 2 normal [[Medal]]'s and the new [[Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane]] were enough.

As for the kill itself, [[Yuudachi]] and [[Kiso]] took extreme offense to the [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]] and removed her from the field, while the [[Kitakami|Torpedo]] [[Ooi|sisters]] took care of the last [[Battleship Princess]]. Didn't end up running support expeditions, from previous experience they show up, maybe kill an enemy DD if I'm lucky and generally fail to achieve anything else, and I already had 6 stacks of bombers + 4 opening torpedo's to do that. Given my retreat rate at B and K, didn't really want to waste the several hours sparkling.

Farming: 37 Transport runs, 25 Boss encounters, 24 Boss Kills. 45 TP per S rank, 43 if Escort FS was Taiha'd before pickup.<br />
Clearance:<br />
6 Transport runs, 5 Boss encounters, 2 Kills. 67 TP per A rank, 99 per S rank.<br />
13 Main Fleet runs, 7 Boss encounters, 5 Kills.

Final run saw [[Kumano]] and [[Tone]] drop the [[Prototype Seiran]] for a [[Zuiun (634 Air Group)]] and [[Drum Canister (Transport Use)]] respectively. TP gauge had 68 points left, and I knew than an A rank would drain 67. So I gave up possible AS at the boss if I lost too many bombers for the chance to clear the map if I got an A rank. Glad I did, since last run was an A rank.

Final Kill saw [[Akizuki]] replaced with [[Ayanami|Ayanmai Kai Ni]] with 2x [[61cm Quintuple (Oxygen) Torpedo Mount]] and [[Skilled Lookouts]] for a torpedo CI against the boss. She never got the chance.

==Event End==
{{Progress|50|Ending Sanity}}
Given all of the goals I set when I started, I can say this is my first 100% success event. Got all of the Event rewards I was after, and found all of the ships I was looking for as well, and then some.

Sanity was starting to fray slightly during E3, mainly due to all the node B and K retreats, but the veterancy of my fleet is beginning to show, especially during E3. Also throwing my best ships at the map probably helped.
