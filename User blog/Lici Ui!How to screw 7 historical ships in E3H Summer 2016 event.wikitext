Abstract:

This guide is for those who have problem in E3 Hard mode Last dance or for reference in clearing E3 Last Dance in general without using the 7 historical ships for braching rule require in B-C-G-H-J. This guide will introduce the background and the journal into this B-C-D-G-H-J with CTF set up as well as recommandation for further improvement and conclusion.

Introduction

As noted by everyone in the comment section, E3 is the jumping gab of difficulty of everyday Kancolle event were E1 and E2 Hard can be consider as a walk in the park but E3 is Hellist in so many ways, although not as hellist as previous event as this map is the last map with lock mechanism while everyone could manage to give in everything they had but not with their best potential ships yet. Various challenger had run insane or just despair with resource shortages because of fail attemps. Hence, from the frontier recomendation of using 7 historical ships had been seem to be the best only hope of light to clear E3 for everyone.

Background

Resource after E2 Hard: ~140k fuel, ~65k ammo, ~110 steel, ~80k bauxite, ~2.5k bucket (Thanks to daily 10 251 250 10)

Fleet strength: HQ lvl 110, 70+ ships are level 90 and above, ~15 ships level 90~80 (Money lover, 95/100)

Experience: Start since spring 2014 event, play casually because of lack of time

Goal: Aim for the reward except Medal with least effort

Clear H2 Hard and start H3 Hard

Because of lack of slot and lack of 1 more historical ship: Kongou (98), Haruna (98), Choukai (97), Fubuki (89), Mikuma (84), Mogami (82), I gave up on using the braching rule and look for alternative road such as B-C-D-G-H-J. During that time, frontier had assumed that (BB+CV)>4? result in D > F which would bring you down to a maelstorm node which reduced fuels further after going through an [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Events/Mechanics airstrike node (-8% fuel and -4% ammo)][1], after that, had to face punishment of Wo at G and Duo Summer BB Hime in H, result in discouragement of the use of Heavy ships in this map. The information were so little, hence the fleet composite set up recommended by frontier during that time was something like 1BB 3CA 2CV + 1CL 3DD 1 CA 1 FBB, with so many CA, one would get Taihaed easily by Wo and DuoBBs as well as in Boss node, hence less player here would actually took on this composite and cleared it. But during that time I found the excelsheet with ships used for braching don't match up as mention, some with 4 (BB+CV) still directed to maelstorm while some already 6 (BB+CV) still going D to G. Curious with this result, I decided to make more runs beside scripping the boss hp while wasting resources to find out more about its braching rule.

Unexpected E3 Hard clear

In the beginning, I start up with fleet composite mentioned on the article and increased the fleet strength little by little in the process of scripping boss hp if the fleet make it through the boss. With only LBAS focus on pre-boss and sent in pre-boss support expedition. During the run, [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User:Kenji135 Kenji135] share that wikiwiki say Bismarck or 4 CV(B) bring your to F node from D while [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User:Kurokami11 Kurokami11], the OP [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Summer_2016_Event/@comment-Kurokami11-20160815200447 varified the claim of Bismarck in braching] [2]. With the available information from frontier in the spreadsheet that prove 4 CV or Bismarck direct to maelstorm, I slowly challenged the limit of the braching rule with my heavy ships but to my suprise, it when into Final Dance much more earlier than I expect. I switched in offencieve ships and gears, start boss support expedition, train all LBAS plane ranks and set 1 LBAS to attack the boss. First try, reached boss with 1 chuuhaed, all support triggered and kill/damage the enemies, only left 2 chuued Boss vs Taiha/Chuuha DD/CL, Green CA/BB after day battle. But in night battle, my FBBs got Taihaed/Chuuhaed before they fired while Choukai barely did any damage to Harbour Hime but manage to bring her down to Taihaed. Finally my last chuuhaed Haruna aim and kill DJ hime result in not clearing. After resting for a while to regain my sanity after got shock by how all my LBAS plane got reck into no rank, I decided to give up in ranking my LBAS plane and go for another round. Second try, 3 chuuhaed ship passed DuoBBHimes, when to boss node, LBAS done crap damage, boss support not trigger, both FBBs got Taihaed. I was very disapointed that time that I did not bother to look. But untill the end of the day battle I looked back, my escort fill with 3 chuuhaed DD/CL/CA and 2 Taihaed FBB vs 2 Green Princess. I was almost going to retried at that point but screw it just keep going until the end. Night battle start, Bang Bang, Ooshio double 200+ damage, follow by Ooyodo coup de grace both sniped the Harbour summer Hime. I was speechless. Then I posted the fleet into [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Summer_2016_Event/@comment-Lici_Ui-20160816091754 the comment section] [3], updated the braching rule main article and when to sleep.

17 August (Wednesday)

<span style="font-weight:normal;">Total of 30+ runs with various compositeto test for braching</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">After unlocking the 3rd LBAS base, I set it into air defence to protect my planes ranking. Still curioused about the D node braching, I kept using various kind of composite untill I had a clearer picture of the braching to match the spreadsheet such as the effect of Yamato and Hayasui in the composite. Along the way Aquila droped and scraped. And finally came to the recent update in the main article of the composite with probably the strongest way to reach boss without going through the maelstorm. When I almost called it a day, Aquaila droped again. In the process I lost another 20k~30k resources and now softcap in scratching E4 boss normal casually. Hopefully I could finish it in time.</span>

*Make use of CL and DDs with<span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span>[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/WG42_(Wurfger%C3%A4t_42) WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)] and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Type_2_Amphibious_Tank Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank] and upgrade it to 10 star if possible for 3x firepower to reach cap damages at night.
*Better to have FBB with higher firepower in escort as the damage formula for [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Type_3_Shell Type 3 Shell] is by multiplying the firepower with 2.5, which mean chuuhaed FBB still got a shot to kill. For example, Iowa.
*Since the boss escorts usually get knockout before the main fleet can get a chance to shell, it is better to just equip all carriers with torpedo bombers (blue) then having some with divebombers (red) to attack bosses.
*Better go for AS+ with more fighters to reduce bauxite cost and lower the enemy bombers strength in opening strike in D and G. AS+ also increase your contact rate to further boost your acc, critical damage and eva from the enemy.
*High ranking double chevron LBAS bomber can helps in killing off the escort for main to focus on himes. You may even send all LBAS to Boss node to have more change of clearing the map if you lack proper ships and equipment, but in exchange for less chance to kill off BB hime twins before they get to fire another round of reck.
*Set Fighter in LBAS are great to reduce the lost of rank. Some Interceptor fighters can also be used for shorter node.
*Ignore FCF during Last Dance for AS+, since in my case it rarely activate as Akizuki often get shohaed while losing a AACI DD in boss node usually make ships reck easily and more chance for boss to Chuhaed/Taihaed the main killer before Night battle. But unless AS+ already achieved, FCF maybe consider.
*Most CA(V) can't produce good damage as FBB on boss most of the time especially Hard mode Last dance when the Boss had 214 armor while the chance for getting chuuhaed is very high. Might as well replace it with Maya with AACI set up and bring in a high level and firepower DD with installation set up to replace a AACI setup DD. But, there is suggestion of using CAV (Tone class) with 2 Guns, [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/WG42_(Wurfger%C3%A4t_42) WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)] and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Type_3_Shell Type 3 Shell] setup by replacing DA in day battle for Big damage at night to reach cap damage.
*Set 3rd LBAS base into interceptor fighter to reduce bauxite lose when farming.
*As for support expedition, support shelling seem to be better than arial support with more chance to kill off escort while saving bauxites, need more testing.
*<span style="font-weight:normal;">Never test fleet composite in Hard mode (Lesson learned TT_TT)</span>
*Hayasui in escort with [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Type_2_Amphibious_Tank Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank] can be fun and have any kind of ship you like to join the fleet, Yamato ect.
*For those who want to exchange more torpedo bomber for opening air strike, adding akatsumaru for fighters would be a great choice, check [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User:IElements IElements]'s [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Summer_2016_Event/@comment-IElements-20160818053122 comment] and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User:Arucart123 Arucart123]'s [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Summer_2016_Event/@comment-Allen92-20160819082238/@comment-Arucart123-20160819090611 comment]  for more information. [4][5]
*There is [http://ja.kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%83%89:718 report of data in jp forum] found the debuff reduce -23 armor of Summer BBhime and Summer Seaporthime. Hence do it and send more LBASs, planes strike, gun, CI and whatever to kill them. [6]

<span style="font-weight:normal;">Conclusion</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">More guns, more airpower, more armor = better survival to reach and kill boss. But watchout for resource comsumption and as well as RNG.</span>
