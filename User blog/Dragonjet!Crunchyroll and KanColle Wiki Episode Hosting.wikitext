{{Warning|title=Project Fails and Closed|message=Kantai Collection anime did not make it into the "partner" wiki release thus we are unable to host it here.}}

[http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/01/03-1/crunchyroll-to-stream-kancolle-and-aldnoahzero-season-2-anime Cruncyroll announced] they were going to stream Kantai Collection anime - but their date is still TBA as of posting. If this pushes through, you know what this means? - episode hosting here on wiki!

I've seen other anime wikis such as [http://swordartonline.wikia.com Sword Art Online]  doing this from their wiki, and there were crunchyroll banners - so I researched and found out about the wikia-crunchyroll partnership [http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-698784/crunchyroll-teams-up-with-wikia [cr]] [http://community.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Kacieh/Crunchyroll_and_Wikia_-_A_Match_Made_in_Anime_Heaven [wiki]].

I'm planning to do the same here, so I asked the SAO admins for help and they gave instructions on [http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Mighty_No._9/Sword_Art_Online_Anime_Series_Now_in_the_Wikia_Video_Library how to do so]. We first look for the episode under [http://video.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Videos video.wikia.com] then add it to the wikia using [[Special:WikiaVideoAdd]].

This is not yet final, and it is not guaranteed Crunchyroll will host KanColle on the wiki as well, it seems only whitelisted series get posted on wiki, but let us hope for the best!

Let's look forward to the anime!

Thanks all~
