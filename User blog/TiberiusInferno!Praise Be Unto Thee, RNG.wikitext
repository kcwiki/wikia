After my last post saying that I would give up on Uzuki, I will be the first to say that I am a hypocrite. Kind of. I was doing some weeklies (to get some more buckets for the upcoming event), and specifically Bw5 (Sink 15 Submarines). I was sortieing on 1-5, 'cause why not? Come up to node I, Perfect S Rank it, and RNG decides to give me my very own pyon. Thank you RNG. May you be kind to me during the event.Â [[File:Tiberiusuzuki.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Welcome to the base!]]
