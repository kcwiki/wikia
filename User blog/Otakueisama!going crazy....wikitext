sigh, 3-2 is such an "annoying" map (cant curse here, sadly)...

kept away from boss node by all the RNG crazy trolling Mode

not only that, went north a few times... so speechless... man, I really don't like this game sometimes... it doesn't mean I hate it all the time, but still... this game can be really annoying sometimes... F RNG... sigh. I get nothing aside from wasting res fixing taiha ships by getting sent north with a bunch of -weak- DD's... = =" If you dont want me to have BB or CV or other a lot more useful ships on my fleet then at least make it so we can clear boss fast and easily, you -xxx- RNG system, Kancolle.



ei-kun (I hate you Kancolle RNG for trolling me aside from event time)
