So, for some unknow reason, my kancolle account was banned 3 days ago. It's been only about a month that I have started playing kancolle, but I even cleared the entire Spring event. I have been using API to play, so I was wondering if that could be a problem since I have never logged onto dmm and switched to a new API. I am still very sad about this incident and I have emailed the customer service at Kancolle official site. All the reply they gave me was that I violated policy number 6 and that they will not reply anymore regardless of my negociation or question about their message. This is really stupid, that is to say they leave players no room to speak for themselves. I honestly did not try anything, anything at all, that is possible of violating the game policy. Perhaps, there is something wrong with playing kancolle with API or playing kancolle using VPN... or something like that. Sigh, I need help, guys. I want to see my Verniy again... I was only able to see her for 3 days when I was looking forward to see her for one month. This is very depressing and displeasing.
