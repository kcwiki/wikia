Hello everyone, this is Stymp :3, a free-to-play-100-slots-scrub-bird-admiral started playing since December 2013.

The deadend is near and I heard there are many who are yet to clear E-7 even on easy because of *insert reason here*. Thus I, the glorious bird-admiral will show you another way to clear this map (or at least, trying).

This method is (in a way) tested, me and a group of 9 <strike>scapegoats</strike> friends had all gotten a Teruzuki for each of us with the luckiest bastard done in 12 runs and the salties about 40 runs. No expensive gear needed.

==Compositions==
=== Chipping X/Y===
Legends said: "''If thee can't pierce through dem armor, thee can always strip dem armor''". Trust me, I'm a bird.

It seem that S-rank node X and Y a few times will lower the boss's armor a bit, allow you to damage the boss easier. Most people said that 3 times X and 3 times Y are enough. Do it or not, how much time, all is your decision. If you do...

''- From the beginning of thy journey, if thee party are that of the Surface Task Force, thee will go south more offen than East.''

''- After the battle against the subs, if thee have neither thunder cruiser (CLT) nor'''' '''sub by thyself, thee shall go South East more offen than South West'''.'''''

''- Passing the trail of Harbour Princess, it's up to thee luck to go North or East, unless thee have the allmighty Akitsumaru by thee side, then thee shall go East regardless of circumstance.''

Basically having Akitsumaru and a CV in STF will send you to H :3

*insert example fleet here*
=== Chipping boss===
The "normal composition" recommend people to use CTF, send them to node J from the choice node and pray to compass. I also heard using 3 CV 1 CVL/ 1 CV 2 CVL etc. will send you to M from J all the time (or most of the time). Still, this is unreliable, instead, there are another route which will send you to the boss 100% if you start at node E. The magical route E-G-I-K-M-Z.

*Pros:

+Guaranteed to boss.

+Avoid a Wo node (namely J).

+Really easy fights before boss (M not included)

+Gluten-free.

*Cons:

-You get to the boss with 20% fuel instead of 40%.

-Require a Fleet Command Facility (FCF) from Ooyodo Kai.

-Require a cold heart (or none at all).
===The fleet:===
[[File:E7fca321.png|thumb|The very team I used]]Core are 2 BB(V) and 3-4 CV(L) 0-1 CA in the main fleet, 1 CL 3 FBB/CA 2 DD in the escort fleet. FCF equiped on 1 CV(L), AACI on the CA or 1CV(L), enough Fighter to reach ~350 AS (fighter skillz included) and those who are very likely to get Taiha, get a Repair Team, or not.

You can consider using 2-3 DD at level 1 or Kai level, use them as mini meat shield for you other girls (this is where the heartless come in).

<span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;">Walkthrough</span>

From start:

: -Get send to B: darn compass. You can either retreat right after the fight, F5, or take this chance to increase the number of X/Y kills.

: -Get sent to E: Trident Formation them \(^.^)/. Worst case: taiha first node -> retreat. Better case: 1 chuuha or no damages at all. From G, you go to I, top left formation for I sub node and bottom left for K air fight, chill out while waiting for those easy fights ∠( ᐛ 」∠)＿.

:: -From K to M is the big deal, if your air power right now is still 320 and up, just use Trident Formation and hope for the best, that mean no more than 1 taiha. If there are 1 taiha, use FCF and send her back or consider keep going on without escort her away if she have a Repair Team equipped (or she is one of those low level DD you don't care about ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ). The same may go for 2 taiha. Again, your choice.

::: -M to boss: You ヽ( ･∀･)ﾉ┌┛Σ(ノ `Д´)ノ AA Hime
Pre-boss support is recommended all the time to increase survival chance, boss support is up to you.
