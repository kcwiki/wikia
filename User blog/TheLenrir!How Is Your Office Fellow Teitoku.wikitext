Thought I start up some amusement and ask fellow Teitoku's what their office is like.

For me, I like to change my office around every now and again, namely to reflect the time and season as well as how I feel.



So for now, with Winter coming (and Winter is COLD in England), I decided to go for a more warm office, with windows representing the cold weather.
