'''Difficulty''': Hard

'''Route''': BFDJ

'''Total Runs''':

*Pre-last dance: ''5 runs''
*Did-not-get-to-boss:'' 9 runs''
*Last Dance: ''32 runs''

Total: ''46 runs''

Bucket used aren't high for 46 runs.....used 37 buckets.....8 was used for paranoid reason.
</div><br /><br />'''Impression''': Fuck this map. Last dance boiled down to sinking the SS Hime that just won't sink. It's like humping a girl but then halfway through she went numb and don't feel a damm thing from any trusting you did and you're left there feeling confused of what you did wrong while she's just staring at you and your limpy trust.Then there's everyone else that said E-1 is ez peezy; that you can clear it easily; that it's not a cockblock at all....but well you have one now. One salty admiral that was cockblocked by E-1, which was supposed to be that one map where everyone can clear with ease or at least minor problem. It doesn't help that my gear wasn't anymore inferior than many others who passed it....heck....some who have inferior gears than me still pass it.

E-1 made me felt like I'm that one kid who didn't get invited to the party when a girl comes by and said everyone can go (to E-2).

'''Depression''': The comp above wasn't a serious one....it's the one that I decided to put Kiso in for the lulz while Katori is being repaired for the lulz. Even ordering of the fleet is for the lulz....I didn't expect this....that a half-baked fleet that I threw in managed to clear the map for me.

I was able to finish Bw1 through E1 alone....

On my 5th Last dance run, I actually sunk the boss....but I got catbombed after that....which means....no boss sunk....no E-1 clear and any ship that got damaged was damaged.

'''Expression''': YUUBARI! I LOVE YOU!

'''Care-able drops''':

8 Uzuki, 3 Kiyoshimo, 2 Asashimo, 1 Ooyodo, 1 Umikaze, 7 Goya, 4 Imuya, 1 Iku, 2 Hachi, 1 Kawakaze and 9 Ooi

(A lot of Ooi and Uzuki drops. I guess I need more light-bulb)

Honestly, I felt a bit bad....this mission is pretty much going to their home and steal their previous supply right from the hand of DJ/Smeagol Hime. It's like Hoppo and her Fish and Presents. It's like Smeagol and his ring. Damm, this map damages me mentally (not) than psychologically.

<br />

'''Difficulty''': Hard

'''Route''': AEIJMO

'''Total Runs''':

Pre-last dance: ''4 runs''

Did-not-get-to-boss:'' 10 runs''

Last Dance: ''6 runs''

Total: ''20 runs''

56 Buckets was used. Most went to runs that didn't reach boss node.
</div><br /><br />'''Impression''': This map feels like 3-5 with opposite comp. route. Instead of having heavy fleet north you have heavy fleet south and vice versa. Either way will be met with opposition (South via the Wo-Kai node and North via every node because DD can cause hiccups)Overall, this map isn't as bad....or as trolling as E-1. While many hiccups occurred during north route it wasn't to the point of salty. Packing your girls with Land-base equipments like WG42 and Sanshiki will do your job well.
ABKM replaced Ooyodo during Last Dance because I need additional pre-torp to deal sink escorts. Using Rei-go fleet is mainly for the lulz (and because I spent a month lvling them so might as well).

Kasumi is placed in FS for AACI chance bonus and for chance to eliminate any leftover escorts during Night battle so Ashigara/Kiyoshimo/Asashimo can focus on boss if they're still alive.

Why no yellow gun on Ashigara? That's the job of ABKM and Kiso (and Asashimo and Kiyoshimo) to eliminate the PTSD IMPS. Ashigara can focus on just punching the boss (TL;DR - I ran out of Yellow guns because I used them for Improvement. Those OTO you see are actually MAX on 3 of them).

'''Depression''': This map took less time and dedication than E-1.....


'''Expression''': BBShimo + 2 WG42 ain't something to underestimate! Last Dance ended with Kasumi shooting down all of the boss' plane rendering her useless during day battle.

'''Care-able drops''':

1 Isokaze, 2 Kiyoshimo, 2 Urakaze, 1 Tokitsukaze, 1 Asashimo

'''Difficulty''': Hard

'''Route''': JKILT

'''Total Runs''':

TP-bar: A LOT

Pre-last dance: ''11 runs''

Did-not-get-to-boss:'' 3 runs''

Last Dance: ''1 run''

Total: ''20 runs''
</div><br /><br />'''Impression''': This map is the combination of the bucket-draining route map of E-3/E-5 of Fall 2015 and a boss node meat shield of E-5 Winter 2015, but with less pain from the boss and pre-boss nodes compared to Winter.TP Bar itself is annoying because of either the sub node rekt-ing your glass DD or the surface node torpedo-ing your ship to taiha. Even after all that, if you wish to farm E-3 you still need to get to boss node and S-rank it for good drops *cough* Okinami *cough*.
HP Bar is pretty simple as long as you don't go Carrier fleet. As long as you get pass the BB hime node you're almost certain of getting to the boss unless the weaker BB node managed to lucky hit you.

Meeting my love in boss node again wasn't fun as she's usually the reason for 1-2 taiha, but it did make the map a lot more challenging.

'''Depression''': The TP bar was not that fun...especially getting to boss and try to S-rank it for drops.

'''Expression''': Praise based Myoukou for sniping the boss!

Too many rare DD grinding this event. No Okinami....next event girl. Other than listed, there's 3 Kiyoshimo, 2 Tokitsukaze, 2 Hatsukaze, 2 Urakaze and 1 Yahagi that already got kai'd and scrapped. 2-3 Kiyoshimo also got scrapped early on because I didn't think about grinding them at first.

Kasumi might not be the one who land the killing blow nor is she the one the performs extraordinarily to the level of Tyrone, but she made it up with one thing; versatility. Kasumi is the one ship that came at the right moment.

Her ability to equip daihatsu allows for faster resource stocking rate; her ability to equip large radar allows for more accuracy; her ability to equip FCF makes her a candidate for Combined fleet flagship while equipping with AACI set-up (not optimal but optional); finally her luck, allows her to equip torpedo cut-in setup.

She's just that one ship that pretty much buffed my resource collection rate and can play the role of AACI ship, Torpedo cut-in ship or Double attack ship and her cyan panty shot is just perfect. She might not be the strongest stat-wise, but a beast in versatility.

I would give her a pat on the head but she'll probably call me "Trash TTK"....probably need to wait till she wants the pat herself.

----

<center>'''Final Impression of this Event'''</center>
<br />
The first two maps of the event was weird. It felt like a buffed up version of 1-5 (E-1) and 3-5 (E-2) with a lot of good drops. E-1 is probably where problem will occur for new players if they don't have good ASW ships which might be a bit harsh on them. E-2 is pretty decent in terms of fairness. E-3 is a pain in TP bar depletion but not as bad as bad as Fall 2015 and the HP bar depletion isn't as bad as E-6 Winter 2015.

The idea of combining the TP bar map and HP bar map into one single map, but separated in route is pretty nice. It made the event pretty much a 4 maps while keeping it at three. The idea of having different combined fleet type starting at different spot is good too, that makes separation between HP bar and TP bar easier than trying to figure out the routing.

Overall, except E-1 I like the event. Others probably say it's too ez, "devs plz make it harder!" and y'know what.....the last time we said something like that we got E-7 Summer. Plz make Kazagumo and Arashi drop....in a more farm friendly map.

Well....till next time. Keep the light-bulb in your head on and don't stop questioning.
