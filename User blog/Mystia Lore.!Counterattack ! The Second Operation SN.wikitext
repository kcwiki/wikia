The admiral was looking at his computer.

'''Myschin :''' What's a Shenanigan by the way ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' I don't know-nanodesu...

==The pre-Event Shenanigans==

===3 days remains until the start of the Event.===

'''Hyuuga :''' Admiral, I want some Zuiuns please !<br />'''Myschin :''' But Hyuuga, you need to be remodeled for that, and you don't have any experience yet...<br />'''Hyuuga :''' That's a problem. I want some Zuiuns. Zuiuns are good. Zuiuns are life. Please remodel me as soon as possible !<br />'''Myschin :''' We will see later, I promise.

Hyuuga left the office and Ise came in a few second later.

'''Ise :''' Ah admiral, I met my sister a few second before. I guess she has talked about Zuiuns ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah but I can't train her now. Everyone is supposed to have holidays but nobody took it.<br />'''Ise :''' Because we can't go on vacation and left you alone.<br />'''Myschin :''' Oh...

----

During a collation with some Destroyers.

'''Akatsuki :''' Commander, your pancakes are so goods.<br />'''Myschin :''' There is plenty left.<br />'''Akatsuki :''' Yay !<br />'''Satsuki :''' Thank you !<br />'''Akebono :''' By the way, why we are here with you ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I asked Akashi some things. Among them is the last key to open the last repair dock. Also, we will enlarge the base to welcome more shipgirls, 20 more actually. With the upcoming Event, there is high chances that we will met some news comrades...<br />'''Satsuki :''' Is that so ?<br />'''Myschin :''' With Hyuuga, you are 94 who lives in this base. The Event only allow participation if we have at least 5 free slots. And even if we are a new base, I think that we will met more than 1 new shipgirl.<br />'''Akebono :''' Sound good. I have to say that you are not shitty for an newly-assigned admiral.<br />'''Myschin :''' I take this as a compliment.

----

In the evening...

'''Myschin :''' Thank you for helping me Yamashiro.<br />'''Yamashiro :''' It can free me from nee-sama's love for an instant so I take the opportunity.<br />'''Myschin :''' So now, I can hope to see Shimakaze in the Recipe.<br />'''Yamashiro :''' I'm not the best person who can help you...<br />'''Myschin :''' Why ? Because some people call you 'unlucky ship' ? I trust you, that's all the matter for me.<br />'''Yamashiro :''' Thank you for your kindness admiral...<br />'''Myschin :''' Ah, look like the timer is 24 minutes... It gonna be a Kagerou-class again.

But after the flame-thrower fairy came, the Recipe opened and...

A huge scream was heard by everyone in the base...

'''Maya :''' Oh, that again ? What is it this time ?<br />'''Tone :''' You say that with such a monotone voice.<br />'''Maya :''' He does this sometimes, we are used to it.<br />'''Furutaka :''' But wait, didn't were was also a girl voice too ?<br />'''Maya :''' Don't care, it's the same for me.

Back at the arsenal...

'''Myschin, in huge despair :''' WHYYYYYYYY ?!<br />'''Yamashiro, lying on the floor :''' Such misfortuneeeee !<br />'''[[Yukikaze]] :''' The eighth ship of Kagerou-class destroyer, I'm Yukikaze. I'll be in your care ! I can feel the presence of the goddess of luck above me !<br />'''Myschin :''' Why ? WHY ? YOU INFERNAL BEAVER OF HELL ! WHY DID YOU CAME NOW ?!<br />'''Yukikaze, smiling :''' ... I don't know =D !<br />'''Myschin :''' I don't like you !<br />'''Yukikaze, smiling :''' Nihihi, I don't caaare !<br />'''Myschin :''' I'm gonna catch you and throw you in a beaver cage !!<br />'''Yukikaze :''' If you can catch me first :P

A car chase began between the admiral and the destroyer, but now matter what, he can't capture her, or Yukikaze's luck was so strong that it prevent anyone to harm her.

'''Myschin, panting :''' Huf... I GIVE UP !<br />'''Yukikaze, smiling :''' Nihihi =D, Try again later.<br />'''Myschin, panting :''' Tch, who gonna take of you ?<br />'''Shiranui, pokerface :''' I will. You don't know how to be nice with this angel.<br />'''Myschin :''' It's a beaver from hell !<br />'''Shiranui, pokerface :''' Soon, you will learn all the goods points about this angel.<br />'''Yukikaze :''' Ne, ne Shiranui-chan, you're so niiice~

Then Shiranui start to nosebleed. Later, the admiral called Zuikaku in order to craft more planes.

'''Zuikaku :''' I don't understand why do you don't like Yukikaze.<br />'''Myschin :''' She came when Yamashiro, out of all girls in the base, helped me with the constructions ! Talk about luck please.<br />'''Zuikaku :''' Speaking of luck, I think that you will be very happy with this new plane.<br />'''Myschin :''' Oh !

The newly crafted plane was the 3-star legendary Reppuu, one of the strongest planes that can be crafted.

'''Myschin :''' Good ! With this plane, we can took a huge advantage in air superiority !<br />'''Zuikaku :''' We will need more than one for that, but it's always a nice start to begin with.

===2 days remains until the start of the Event.===

'''Myschin :''' Now I can worry a lot. No matter how many times we can go into Bashi islands or Orel bay, we can't find Haruna !<br />'''Inazuma :''' Hum admiral, there is other way to search for her-nanodesu.<br />'''Myschin :''' Ah ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' Now that you cleared the Okinoshima Island campaign, you can go into the northern seas.<br />'''Myschin :''' Oh I see... The new area is called... The Moray Sea ? It reminds me about the Moral Abyss level in Ecco : the Tides of Time. Let's see... What ?! No data about this area ?!<br />'''Inazuma :''' Well, it's not a frequented area.<br />'''Myschin :''' So we can go with whatever fleet we want ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' I want to say yes-nanodesu ? But the compass is probably random too.<br />'''Myschin :''' Glup ! I hope we will not encounter the same bullshit as we do in the Coastal zone and the Okinoshima Islands...

Moments later, a fleet led by Inazuma with Akatsuki, Maya, Kongou, Ise, and Shouhou prepared to go to this new area.

'''Myschin :''' ... I have not really something to say here ladies. This area seems so random...<br />'''Kongou :''' Worry not, we will conquer this area within the day !

But right at the beginning of the mission, the compass girls sent the fleet in the wrong direction.

'''Kongou :''' BLOODY HELL !!<br />'''Ise :''' Calm down. As the admiral said before, it's random.

Later, back at the naval base.

'''Myschin :''' Honestly, it would have been too much to win at our first time...<br />'''Kongou :''' I'm still pissed...<br />'''Myschin :''' There, there. I'll allow you to be really pissed if we can't reach the boss's node after 30 or so tries, like Okinoshima Island.<br />'''Kongou :''' Oh Okay-desu.<br />'''Myschin :''' Do you feel you can go another time now ?<br />'''Maya :''' Yeah, let's say it was an accident. Let's kick ass and chew bubble gum... Ah shoot I don't have any bubble gum...<br />'''Myschin, laughing :''' That's the spirit Maya, now go !

And for the second time, the fleet went to the Moray sea again, but this time...

'''Akatsuki :''' Yay, we took the good path this time.<br />'''Ise :''' This is still another branch after the battle.<br />'''Kongou :''' Whoah, the abyssals bring Flagships units right from the start now.<br />'''Maya :''' Meh, it's only some Light cruisers, we can deal with them !

And the fleet managed to win their first battle with a S-Rank.

'''Myschin, through microphone :''' Everyone is fine ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' Yes, nothing but scratch-nanodesu.<br />'''Kongou :''' Now, the only problem left is...<br />'''Compass Girls :''' We're baaack ! That Tatsuta was awful the last time, but now NOBODY will interfere with us this time ! Our Almighty Compass will deliver his judgement !!<br />'''Akatsuki :''' This isn't just a regular compass ?<br />'''Compass Girls :''' How dare you ! Let's spin it !

The needle pointed to the North-East.

'''Compass Girls :''' Oh no ! We failed to troll them !!<br />'''Maya :''' Move around you stupid fairies.<br />'''Ise :''' I wonder what kind of enemy await us now...

Her response came quickly... With an abyssal fleet led by a Flagship Ru-class and a Flagship Wo-Class

'''Ise :''' Oops, it's only the first zone and they bring a strong force !<br />'''Ru-class Flagship :''' You represent a threat to our forces ! Our superiors don't care for now, but we must stop you !<br />'''Maya :''' So they took seriously eh ? Bring it on !<br />'''Wo-class Flagship :''' No so fast ! WO gonna be rekt this time ?!<br />'''Shouhou :''' I won't allow that !

But Maya was damaged by the abyssal planes.

'''Maya :''' Don't joke with me ! J...just wait and see !<br />'''Ru-class Flagship :''' Well done, Wo-class !<br />'''Kongou :''' You will regret that !

But neither Ru-class or Wo-class was targeted.

'''Ru-class Flagship :''' My turn !

And she heavily damaged Ise.

'''Ise :''' Gah ! My long-awaited flight-deck is...<br />'''Shouhou :''' Inazuma, Akatsuki, take care of the destroyers so I'll can aim at their flagships !<br />'''Inazuma :''' Yes-nanodesu !

In the end, the fleet managed to win, at night time, with all of the heavy ships damaged. Akatsuki and Izanuma remain unscathed.

'''Kongou :''' It was one hell of a battle but we won YES !<br />'''Myschin :''' It's good to know. We won't often come back here but...<br />'''Inazuma :''' Something wrong admiral ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes, now we can access to the infamous Kis Island !<br />'''Akatsuki :''' Hey but now we can go with a Light cruiser as the flagship !<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah but still, I fear this area, except for the first battle if we took the north route. My friends on the Communication Network told me that this is a great area for training as long as we bring a sub to tank the enemies's attacks.

===1 day remains until the start of the Event.===

Somewhere in an abyssal place

'''Hime#1 :''' ...<br />'''Hime#2 :''' What's wrong sweetie ? You can't wait until tomorrow ?<br />'''Hime#1 :''' I just... Want to see the moon again. I'll... Crush any opponent who will interfere with me !<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Ohohoh, that's the spirit sweetie. Soon, soon, you just have to wait.<br />'''Hime#1 :''' Beside that... Something bother me.<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Hmm ? What ?<br />'''Hime#1 :''' The new hime who came a little earlier... She is a destroyer too, right ?<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Yes, she is our precious trump card who will inflict the worst trauma to the humans who will face us.<br />'''Hime#1 :''' But why she does have thoses... things ? I... I don't have such the same...<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Hu ? What are you talking about ?<br />'''Hime#1 :''' Those equipments... * I can't tell her it's about the chest, she will do weird things to me again... Fortunately we have found that foreign destroyer who will keep her busy *

'''Hime#3 :''' Heavy oh. Heavy oh. Gonna be all pretty to face to despicable shipgirls, and then SINK SINK SINK them nyahahahah !!<br />'''Hime#4 :''' You are so excited it's almost scary !<br />'''Hime#3 :''' I CAN'T WAIT ANY FURTHER !! WOOOH !<br />'''Hime#4 :''' * Really scary in fact !! *<br />'''Hime#5 :''' ...<br />'''Hime#4 :''' Oh come on you, why are you so quiet since we began to prepare this operation ? Say something !<br />'''Hime#5 :''' I am looking at this new admiral's datas. Even if there so few about him, we must not underestimate him !<br />'''Hime#4 :''' Pff, again with this overprotective attitude of your ? You worry too much ! He's just a 1-month freakin' new admiral ! How does he can be a threat ?!<br />'''Hime#5 :''' That's because we don't have enough datas. Just because he failed to conquer the Okinoshima Island in a short time doesn't mean he don't know what he doing.<br />'''Hime#4 :''' Just wait until one our earlier hime stop him and you will see.<br />'''Hime#5 :''' ... Right * They are REALLLY underestimate him, that could be a problem... *

'''Hime#2 :''' So you're a new hime right ? How strong are you ?<br />'''Hime#6 :''' Ooooh I don't know, how about I whip your ass to measure my strength ?<br />'''Hime#2 :''' ... Ewww gross !<br />'''Hime#6 :''' It's fine you know ? At worst, I will drag those admirals to the abyssal side !

----

In the admiral's office.

'''Yayoi, purring :''' Please pat me more...<br />'''Myschin :''' Erm, I would like to, but I have some work right, can't you let me alone 5 minutes ?<br />'''Yayoi :''' No way...

Yayoi was carried like a princess by the admiral.

'''Myschin :''' Pretty please Yayoi, it has been a countless number of circles around the office.<br />'''Yayoi :''' I'm gonna sulk if you don't play with me more.<br />'''Myschin :''' Tch, let's see if I'm able to work without my arms.

A few second later.

'''Kirishima, Kako, Sendai, Jintsuu, Inazuma, I-58 :''' ...<br />'''Myschin, still holding Yayoi in his hands :''' I'm sorry...<br />'''Yayoi, sparkling :''' Purrrfect...<br />'''I-58 :''' Why don't you just realease her ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I can't. Otherwise she will become to sulk and I don't want that... Anyway, if I called the 6 of you, it's for a training session in the north of the Kis Island. let's see how many experience you can get from 1 sortie.<br />'''The 6 girls in the fleet :''' Yes admiral.<br />'''Inazuma :''' What can we do to force you to leave the admiral Yayoi ?<br />'''Yayoi, purring :''' I don't know... Just wait until I have enough...<br />'''Inazuma :''' It could take the whole day !!<br />'''Myschin :''' Go to the Kis Island then we will see after that.

In the Kis island's nearby.

'''Kako :''' That was rather easy.<br />'''Kirishima :''' Yes, maybe it's because there is only lesser units who will only attack submrines.<br />'''I-58, moderately damaged :''' Oh well, I can go again without going to the repairs dock.<br />'''Inazuma :''' Wait, there is someone here !

Back at the admiral's office, Yayoi has fall asleep is the admiral's hands.

'''Myschin :''' Great, what I am gonna do now ?<br />'''Yayoi :''' ... Please pat me more...

Then suddenly, the office's door was opened.

'''Sendai :''' We are back !<br />'''Myschin :''' Hu ? Something wrong ? Did someone get hurt too much ?<br />'''Jintsuu :''' Not... Not yet but...<br />'''???? :''' The heck is wrong with you Kirishima ! I freakin' don't care about that rivalry ! Leave me alone, so I could meet the boss here.<br />'''Myschin :''' Hu ?! Who is that ?!

Then, much to the admiral's surprise, Haruna entered in the office.

'''[[Haruna]] :''' Fast battleship, Haruna, reporting for duty. You're the boss here, correct ? I'm looking forward to working with you.<br />'''Myschin :''' Wait, something wrong here !<br />'''Haruna, menacing voice :''' Ah ? Yes, that Kirishima is sticking to my side. Can I beat the crap out of her ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Wait wait wait ! Aren't you supposed to be someone very kind with everyone ?<br />'''Haruna :''' I'm only kind with my big sister Kongou and the person who command her.<br />'''Myschin :''' But I am the admiral here and Kongou is under my command.<br />'''Haruna :''' Ah, I'm sorry. Please let me cut myself to apologize !<br />'''Myschin :''' ... I refuse. Are you a yakuza or what ?!

Then Kongou entered the office herself.

'''Haruna :''' Aneki !!<br />'''Kongou :''' So you're finally there Haruna... Let me tell you that the admiral here like the quiet girls.<br />'''Myschin :''' It's not like that I hate the hot-blooded girls though.<br />'''Kongou :''' So please Haruna, be more gentle with everyone would you ?<br />'''Haruna :''' ... I guess I have no choice then...

Later in the day, there was several incidents caused by Haruna, who clashed with other hot-blooded girls such as Maya and Tenryuu, but Kongou managed to calm everything. In the evening, Zuikaku helped the admiral to craft some planes, and a second Ryuusei Kai and a new plane, the Suisei 12A were crafted.

Night time. The admiral has released his eldrazis around the base. Now he is looking at the sea with a deep look.

'''Myschin :''' It's coming... Our very first major operation... I wonder if I will meet that girl too.<br />'''Inazuma, sitting next to the admiral :''' You talking about Harusame again ?<br />'''Myschin :''' No, I'm talking about the Destroyer Hime. Somehow I really want to keep her with me.<br />'''Inazuma :''' ... I'm not sure that the Headquarter allow you to keep an abyssal being in the base.<br />'''Myschin :''' I am sure that I can. I just need to let her live as a civilian.<br />'''Inazuma :''' But thoses abyssals probably will not listen to you, you know ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Until we will meet them, we can't be sure. I just want to dream a little. You know, in another world, everyone said that the eldrazis were impossible to tame, and now look, they are here to protect you. The abyssals can't be more heartless than them.<br />'''Inazuma :''' If you say so... Shouldn't you go sleep now ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Just a moment please. The moon in the starry sky is beautiful...<br />'''Inazuma, blushing :''' Do... Do you know what did you just say ?<br />'''Myschin, surprised :''' Erm, I don't think there is a hidden message behind that sentence ^^'<br />'''Inazuma, still blushing :''' * He don't know ? This is still so embarassing ! *

----

'''Hime#1 :''' Anytime now... I want so see the moon again !<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Just a little further and then you could go.

==E-1 Prepare for Second Operation SN !==

===Firsts steps into the Event===

It has finally came.

'''Myschin :''' This is it ladies ! It's the first day of the Event !<br />'''Maya :''' Let's go, let's go ! I want to kick some abyssal's ass now !!<br />'''Myschin :''' I can understand that you are excited but we need to wait a little. We can't just go like that. I need some datas... I will follow my mentor's progression first.

On the communication Network.

'''Suna :''' Are you ready ? I'm gonna go in a few second.<br />'''Myschin :''' With the visual recording, it will be easy to see what await us...<br />'''Suna :''' The shiplock is there for us veterans, but in your case, you don't have to worry about it, since you are a newly assigned admiral, you will be not forced to use it.<br />'''Myschin :''' I see...<br />'''Suna :''' ...<br />'''Myschin :''' Something wrong ?<br />'''Suna :''' ... Yes, you're not gonna like what will happen if we reach the boss.<br />'''Myschin :''' Eh ?

----

'''Shiratsuyu :''' What's wrong with the commander ? He seems to be very depressed.<br />'''Murasame :''' It's true, I've never saw him so depressed before... I don't want to attack him now...<br />'''Fusou :''' He is even more depressed than me in my worst days...<br />'''Fumizuki :''' Hihihi, then I'm gonna give him a warm smile again.<br />'''Inazuma :''' Wait a moment-nanodesu. I want to know why he is so depressed now.<br />'''Natori :''' But there is this depressing aura all around his office. Even Yayoi don't want to approach him for now.<br />'''Inazuma :''' I have to be strong and see what happened-nanodesu !

Taking his courage in two hands, Inazuma entered the admiral's office. Immediately, she started to feel a litle desperate.

'''Myschin, slumped over his desk :''' Why ? Why ? Why ? I can't... I can't go...<br />'''Inazuma :''' Ad-Admiral ?<br />'''Myschin, raising his head :''' Inazuma ? Why did you came here ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' It's the first time we saw you that depressed... We... We want to know. What happened ?<br />'''Myschin :''' It's too soon ! Too soon ! Why does it have to be like that right from the start ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' What is too soon ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I... I can't do it. It means that we have to hurt her... I DON'T WANT TO HURT HER !!<br />'''Inazuma :''' ADMIRAL ! What's going on-nanodesu ?!<br />'''Myschin :''' This first operation... Why do we have to fight the Destroyer Hime ?!<br />'''Inazuma :''' Ah...<br />'''Myschin :''' I just can't harm her. I want to save her, not to hurt her...<br />'''Inazuma :''' But admiral, if you do nothing then you will not be able to save her either.<br />'''Myschin :''' Why so soon ? Why she has to be our first major opponent ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' This is something we can't know until you ask her directly.<br />'''Myschin :''' ...

Inazuma noticed that the depressing aura has vanished.

'''Myschin :''' Maybe... Yes... Maybe I can do this... I don't care about the Headquarters, I'm gonna capture her at the end of the battle ! Such an opportunity may not came in a long time after that !

A moment later, the admiral apologized to all of the girls in the naval base.

'''Myschin :''' I'm sorry to have let my personal feelings interfere with our mission. Thus said, I have an announcement to make. If we will this first major battle, then I'm gonna keep the Destroyer Hime in our base.<br />'''Most of the shipgirls :''' Whaaat ?!<br />'''Myschin :''' Most of you, especially the oldest girls in this base, know how I want to make peace with the abyssals and save the Destroyer Hime. This is a perfect opportunity. It's soon but don't worry, I'll take responsability for keeping an abyssal in our base.<br />'''Kongou :''' Well, it's not like we can't trust you. After all, there are those indescribable creatures all around the base to protect us.<br />'''Myschin :''' And now, it's time for us to dive into this Event.

The admiral called Inazuma, Natori, Mochizuki, Shiratsuyu, Fumizuki and Ikazuchi.

'''Ikazuchi :''' Tell me commander, it is because all of our 6 have brown hairs that we will go together ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Why not ? And I'm gonna go as well.<br />'''Mochizuki :''' Hey, don't try to catch the enemy earlier.<br />'''Myschin :''' I'm not gonna do that ! I need to see her with my own eyes.

And then the fleet penetrate the first area of the Event.

'''Myschin :''' With our fleet composition, we should be able to reach Destroyer Hime's node almost every time...<br />'''Compass girls :''' Nyohohohoh !<br />'''Shiratsuyu :''' Ewww, the gross fairies are here again.<br />'''Compass girls :''' Shaddup and rejoice ! With the right composition, you can always reach your objective. But we won't tell you if your current composition is the right one !<br />'''Myschin :''' Spin the compass and we will see.

And to the surprise of the admiral and the fleet, the first sortie ended in a dead end.

'''Myschin :''' Hu ?! What happened ?! We followed the right composition right ?!<br />'''Compass girls :''' Yes but you need a specific girl in order to secure your path to the boss, without this girl, your light fleet will always have a small chance to go into that dead end.<br />'''Myschin :''' And I guess you're not gonna tell us who is this girl right ?<br />'''Compass girls :''' Of course not ! Find by yourself ohohoh !

===The first encounter===

Later in the day...

'''Natori :''' Do you think our composition is bad ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I don't think so. We followed the rules, with 1 Light cruiser and 5 Destroyers because it's the easiest path to the boss, even with the randomness.<br />'''Ikazuchi :''' Don't worry, this first sortie was an accident. We will reach the boss this time !

And after the first battle, the compass girls sent the fleet to the south.

'''Myschin :''' Good, we can reach the boss's area for sure.<br />'''Shiratsuyu :''' If we can pass the next battle first.

There was 2 Ru-class Elite whow waited for them.

'''Myschin :''' Hu ?! You kidding right ?! Such strong enemies right from the start ?!<br />'''Inazuma :''' This is probably why the compass girls told us about the right shipgirl, maybe she can let us pass directly to the resource node ?

The battle was intense and Mochizuki took moderate damages, but the fleet was still able to continue.

'''Myschin :''' Here it is...

The Destroyer Hime was apparently waiting for the fleet to come. She had a long side ponytail and a spiked hat, but her missing legs were the unavoidable thing to look at her.[[File:KanColle-150810-21023727.png|thumb|398px]]



'''[[Destroyer Princess |Destroyer Hime]] :''' So you came... I won't let you go any further... I won't... BE DEFEATED !!<br />'''Myschin :''' We can talk...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Are you kidding ? The only language that we will speak here is the violence ! Now attack my fellow destroyers !!

A ferocious battle began between the two forces.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Sink ! SINK !<br />'''Natori, moderately damaged :''' Uwaaah, she's strong !

Shiratsuyu was heavily damaged as well.

'''Myschin :''' Please, listen to me !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' You're annoying ! Just because you sank my friends won't mean that I'm defeated yet !<br />'''Mochizuki :''' Maybe we should engage a night battle.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' It's no use ! I won't be defeated !!<br />'''Myschin :''' She... She won't listen to me...<br />'''Inazuma :''' Then there is only one way to reason her-nanodesu !

Inazuma managed to Cut-In the abyssal hime and knock out her in 1 shot.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' AAAAH ! YOU LITTLE... !<br />'''Myschin :''' UWAAAH ! You almost gave me an heart attack Inazuma !!<br />'''Inazuma :''' Sorry admiral, but this is the only way if you want to talk with her.<br />'''Destroyer Hime, cornered :''' You... You won that first battle... BUT I'M NOT DEFEATED YET ! I won't let you win !!<br />'''Myschin :''' Listen to me please...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Get lost !

Before the admiral can say anything else, Destroyer Hime ran away. The fleet came back to the base soon after.

'''Myschin :''' I swear Inazuma. Next time, prevent me when you will do something like that please.<br />'''Inazuma :''' I'm sorry admiral, but now you know what can happen if we are forced to advance in night battles.<br />'''Myschin :''' I also guess that we have to rely on this method if I want her to listen to me.<br />'''Inazuma :''' Yes...<br />'''Myschin :''' Okay... I'll not panic the next time. Everyone, take a rest, then we will come back here again.<br />'''Shiratsyu, Mochizuki, Fumizuki, Ikazuchi, Natori :''' Yes admiral.

===Kikuzuki's help & Urakaze's arrival===

'''Natori, heavily damaged :''' Uwaaah !<br />'''Shiratsuyu, heavily damaged :''' ...It hurts, it's cold, it's embarrassing... Just you wait and see !<br />'''Mochizuki, heavily damaged :''' Seriously, I said it hurts a lot !<br />'''Myschin :''' Retreat !!

For the third sortie, the fleet ended in the Ru-classes's node again, but this time, it was a complete defeat for the shipgirls.

'''Ikazuchi :''' This is no good at all, we can't reach that node and then hope to survive 2 Ru-class Elites attacks if we want to progress...<br />'''Myschin :''' For sure yes, but we still don't know who is the shipgirl who can let us avoid that node...

Later in the day, the admiral received a notification from an unknown sender on the Communication Network.

'''Myschin :''' I really don't like when a stranger come like that but... Hu ?

"Use Kikuzuki". Only 2 words, nothing else. The admiral was confused for a second. Then he called Kikuzuki in his office.

'''Kikuzuki :''' Why did you called me admiral ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Do you know anything about that second SN Operation ?<br />'''Kikuzuki :''' I was indeed involved in it, but my role was minor.<br />'''Myschin :''' Can you go with the fleet ?<br />'''Kikuzuki :''' I would like to, but Mikazuki will want to go too...<br />'''Myschin :''' Arf...<br />'''Fumizuki :''' Eheheh commander, don't worry. I'll leave my place in the fleet to my sister and I'll take care of Mikazuki. Then it's good, right ?<br />'''Kikuzuki :''' Yes... We can go whenver you want commander.

----

'''Compass girls :''' Ohohoh, you finally found the right shipgirl !

And the compass pointed directly to the boss's node after the first battle.

'''Kikuzuki :''' ... Right... I came here a long time ago.<br />'''Myschin :''' You will be alright ?<br />'''Kikuzuki :''' Yes, don't worry about me...

And the fleet met Destroyer Hime for the second time.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' You came back eh... obstinate shipgirls !<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah, we will come again and again, until you finally will listen to what I have to say...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Then I'll sink you once and for all !!

The battle that followed afterward was pretty much the same as the first. The abyssal princess was cornered and Inazuma finished her with another cut-in.

'''Destroyer Hime, panting :''' Kuh... It hurts... IT HURTS !<br />'''Myschin :''' LISTEN ! We can end this battle without hurting each others anymore !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Go to hell ! I'll never listen to a human !

And then she ran away for the second time.

'''Inazuma :''' I guess she will break soon...<br />'''Myschin :''' If only she would listen to me before that...<br />'''Natori :''' Ah admiral ! There is a new comrade here.<br />'''Myschin :''' Hu ? A new comrade ? Even if we went without using the shiplocking mechanism ?!

The admiral saw a girl with blue hairs.

'''[[Urakaze]] :''' Hello ! It's me, Urakaze, nice to meet'ya !<br />'''Myschin :''' WHOA ! Oh my god !<br />'''Urakaze :''' Oh ? Are ya the admiral of that fleet ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Ah yes but... Let me take a break for a second. You... You are a very uncommun shipgirl, am I right ?<br />'''Urakaze :''' If ya say so...

The fleet came back to the base with their new comrade.

'''Urakaze :''' Oooh, it look like very recent.<br />'''Myschin :''' Ah yes... I was assigned a little more than a month ago.<br />'''Urakaze :''' Oh I see...<br />'''Myschin :''' In fact, you are the first non-buildable Destroyer to came in our base.<br />'''Urakaze :''' So it mean that neither Hamakaze, Tanikaze or Isokaze is here ?<br />'''Myschin :''' No, and I'm sorry...<br />'''Urakaze :''' I'm not worried ya see ? At least Kagerou and some of their sisters are there, right ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes...<br />'''Urakaze :''' And if ya have 4 fleets activated, it does mean that...<br />'''Kongou :''' URAKAZE !!<br />'''Urakaze, very happy :''' Kongou-onee-sama !

The 2 shipgirls hug each other and the admiral suddenly noticed the same hair style between the two.

'''Myschin :''' Ah, I see why she called her onee-sama<br />'''Hiei :''' HIEIII ! A RIVAL ?!<br />'''Myschin :''' Oh sh...

And then, another incident involving Hiei happened once again in the naval base, and Kongou gave a lecture to her sister afterward.

Later in the evening...

'''Inazuma :''' Admiral, you don't want to go fight the Destroyer Hime again ?<br />'''Myschin :''' We are not in a hurry and...

On the communication Network

'''Suna :''' RAAAH ! How this can be ?! Why E-3 is so hard ?!<br />'''Peluche :''' Seriously...<br />'''Cap'tain Fist :''' And this is only E3 right ?<br />'''Suna :''' 3 himes-class enemies are too much ! And even if I can pass this map... My own mentor... He saw what await us after that infamous E3... You 3 will sooner of later start to feel the same terror as we felt back in the IronBottom Sound Event !<br />'''Myschin, Peluche, Cap'tain Fist :''' ...<br />'''Suna :''' That new hime is TOO STRONG damnit !

The admiral saw other peoples complaining about the E3 map too...

'''Suna :''' There are already some veterans who fell into madness and some others are even quitting their post !! This Event is a pure madness, and it's only the E3 ! There is 4 more maps that come after this one !!

This night, the admiral fell asleep while hearing some of the complaints from the others admirals.

'''Myschin :''' * Damn, and this is our first Event... *

===The last battle and the unexpected arrival.===

The next day, somewhere in an abyssal place.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Why ?! Why I can't win against him ?!<br />'''Hime#1 :''' Oh sweetie, you lost again ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Uuuh, it's the third time... And that admiral who try to speak with me... How dare he try to do that ? It's because of the humans if we were born in the first place !!<br />'''Hime#2 :''' It's time to unleash your wrath. Time to be stronger. Time to inflict the most pain to those shipgirls !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' That Inazuma... She cut-in me everytime. I can't even counter-attack ! I... I don't want to loose again ! I'm at my limit now ! I don't want to be defeated !!<br />'''Hime#1 :''' You won't be defeated. You are filled with determination now. You can win against him !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Yes... YES !

Later, on the battlefield...

'''Myschin :''' Gah... She way thougher than the last time. What happened ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' I... I don't know-nanodesu.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' I WON'T LET YOU WIN !! NOW SINK !!<br />'''Myschin :''' Retreat ! Retreat !

Back at the base.

'''Myschin :''' Something is different about her... She seems more... Determinated.<br />'''Inazuma :''' It means that we can definitively win against her. We need to knock her down one last time. It's the last dance.<br />'''Myschin :''' If it's all about determination... Then we must be determinated as well... How are we gonna do that ?<br />'''Natori :''' I don't know...<br />'''Mochizuki :''' You could promise me to play some video games with me...<br />'''Myschin :''' That's not enough and would only work on you alone...<br />'''Shiratsuyu :''' Then how about more pancakes ?<br />'''Myschin :''' It's too early for that. Maybe after the end of the Event, but not before it end...

Everyone thought about an idea until...

'''Myschin :''' Okay girls, at least, you can do something for me that would make me very happy.<br />'''Ikazuchi :''' Which is ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Just win against the Destroyer Hime so I could capture her afterward !<br />'''Ikazuchi :''' Oh well, it's the initial plan right ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes, but we must believe in it.

Later, back in the boss's node.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Obstinate girls, why did you came again ?! I'll sent you back in your pathetic base !<br />'''Myschin, determined :''' NO ! YOU GONNA LISTEN TO ME THIS TIME ! I WILL SAVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT IT COST TO ME !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' YOU CAN'T SAVE ME ! IT'S TOO LATE NOW !<br />'''Myschin :''' IF I COULD BRING A TIME MACHINE, I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU A LONG TIME AGO. THE THING IS, I DON'T HAVE A TIME MACHINE !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' AH SHUT UP ! I'M GONNA NOT SINK THOSE SHIPGIRLS, BUT I WILL KILL YOU FOR SURE !<br />'''Myschin :''' ONLY IF YOU CAN WIN AGAINST MY GIRLS ! NOW GO EVERYBODY !<br />'''Inazuma, Natori, Shiratsuyu, Mochizuki, Kikuzuki, Ikazuchi :''' YES ADMIRAL !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Attack, fellow destroyers !!

The most intense battle started right after that, and finally, while Shiratsuyu and Mochizuki were moderately damaged, only the Destroyer Hime remains on the other side...

'''Destroyer Hime :''' I'm not defeated yet ! You won't ! Defeat me !<br />'''Myschin :''' This is actually my last chance before she kill me if we fail ! So give everything you have !<br />'''All the shipgirls :''' YES !

The night battle began and Inazuma already armed her torpedoes for a cut-in but...

'''Destroyer Hime :''' This trick... WON'T WORK AGAIN !!

Then Destroyer Hime managed to Cut-in Mochizuki, who fell into heavy damaged state.

'''Mochizuki :''' AAARGH !<br />'''Myschin :''' Natori ! Do something !<br />'''Natori, determinate :''' I'll... I'LL TRY !

But neither of Natori's two attacks were enough to knock Destroyer Hime down !

'''Destroyer Hime :''' I WON'T GIVE UP ! YOU... CAN'T... WIN !!<br />'''Myschin :''' Shi... Shiratsuyu !

But the destroyer missed her because of her moderately damaged state...

'''Myschin :''' Ki... Kikuzuki please !<br />'''Kikuzuki :''' Right !

Kikuzuki managed to wound the abyssal hime enough to put her into a heavy damaged state but it was not enough.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' This... is... useless... I won't be... Defeated... I won't...<br />'''Myschin :''' How can she still standing ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' They are not called 'hime' for nothing...<br />'''Myschin :''' It's over ! I'm so dead now.<br />'''Ikazuchi :''' Wait commander, it's my turn now !<br />'''Myschin :''' Ikazuchi ! It's now or nothing ! I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP RIGHT NOW !

Those words resonated in Ikazuchi's ears.

'''Ikazuchi :''' * The commander really need my help. He really need my help. He have to rely on me ! *

Then Ikazuchi suddenly started to sparkle so bright that it could match Fumizuki's smile.

'''Ikazuchi, max sparkled :''' Commander... YOU CAN RELY ON ME !!

Then Ikazuchi loaded her torpedoes and fired at Destroyer Hime. A huge explosion resounded.

'''[[File:KanColle-150811-18471527.png|thumb|400px]]Destroyer Hime :''' Ah... No... It... It can't be... I... I have... lost... ?

The abyssal princess fell in the water. Then she slowy raised her hand in the sky.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' The moon... It is... Beautiful.

And she began to sink in the ocean.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Ah... No... NOOO ! I don't want to sink again... The bottom of the sea is so cold, so dark... I don't... Please... Someone... Help... Me...

Then she fainted and everything became black around her.

...<br />...<br />...

'''Destroyer Hime :''' * I remember. Once again... I was... Harusame... And the humans abandoned me to my sad faith, they didn't even try to help me back then... Damn you humans. My thirst for vengeance allow me to survive and become an abyssal ship... But now I have lost my last hopes. *

...<br />...<br />...

'''Destroyer Hime :''' * Wait a second... How can I still think about everything ?! I am supposed to be dead now, right ?! What's going on ?! *

Then suddenly, she woke up.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Hu ?! Where I am ?!

She looked around her and they she saw an indescribable creature who was looking at her.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... Right, I am in hell I guess.<br />'''Myschin :''' So... You're finally awake, aren't you ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Hu ?!

She turned her head to the right and she saw the human who came to fight her in the sea.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Y-You !<br />'''Myschin :''' Please stay calm, your wounds are not healed yet.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Where I am ?<br />'''Myschin :''' You are currently in a repair dock inside my naval base. After your defeat, I managed to save you from sinking in the ocean.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... So I am still... Alive ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Wounded but alive, yes.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Then what is this creature ?!<br />'''Myschin :''' This ? It's a measure of protection.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ...

She remind silent for a few seconds then...

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Why ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Why what ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Why did you save me ? I'm an abyssal ship... I'm an enemy of your race.<br />'''Myschin :''' This must be the case, but I'm not an human from this world. I studied a lot before I came to this place. You abyssal ships want to avenge your previous death before you became abyssal ships right...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' This is something that a few humans who would tell...<br />'''Myschin :''' I believe in the fact that you are not the heartless monsters that most of the people in this world are talking about. I believe that I can bring an end to this war.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' It's futile... This war stand lasts too long to be ended just like that...<br />'''Myschin :''' I traveled around several worlds and some of them were gnawed by war. Some amoung them managed to make peace after all. I want... I want to give you a chance, to make peace with the natives humans of this world, to free all of your abyssal from that vengeful curse.<br />'''Destroyer Hime, laughing a little :''' Fufufu, what a noble intention... But you are not the first to claim that... Do you really think you can change anything ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes, I'm sure.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Now I'm curious to see if you can really change anything... But you should have started with another hime...<br />'''Myschin :''' Actually...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I wanted to save YOU as soon as possible, but I didn't expected to encounter you so soon.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' And why me in the first place ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Because you are Harusame to begin with, right ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... You know about that...<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes. When I came to this world, about 9 month ago, I saw you for the first time in the Operation Kon. Then I wanted to save you from your condition.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' You can't change me back into Harusame. I have memories from the pasts, but now I am the Destroyer Hime.<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah I know, but it doesn't matter. Actually, the fact that you are legless affected my decision to save you.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... Are you telling me that you want to give me new legs ?<br />'''Myschin :''' No, I guess you can go where you want without legs, but I want to take care of you, to bring you a nice life.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' I can't trust you just like that...<br />'''Myschin :''' Then...

The admiral approached his face close to Destroyer Hime's.

'''Myschin :''' Perhaps this will convince you...

He began to kiss the abyssal princess on the lips.

'''Destroyer Hime, blushing :''' ... !<br />'''Myschin :''' I'll take care of you, I promise.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' But... I can't stay with you in this naval base !<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes you can. I'll take responsability for whatever can happen.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' But the shipgirls won't accept my presence so easily...<br />'''Myschin :''' This is something that I told them before actually. They will have no choice.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' And your superiors ? They won't complain ?<br />'''Myschin :''' As long as I safely keep you within my base, everything will be fine.

Then someone came.

'''Inazuma :''' A-Admiral... Are you still...<br />'''Myschin :''' It's already decided Inazuma.<br />'''Inazuma :''' Awawawa...<br />'''Myschin :''' And I had to kiss her to prove my sincerity.<br />'''Inazuma, blushing :''' Awawawa !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... OK... I will become a resident in this naval base. I swear I will do everything to feel happy.<br />'''Myschin :''' Actually, I plan to search for Harusame in the next area...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... We will see later about that.<br />'''Myschin :''' Then let me carry you outside of the dock and let's go meet the other shipgirls.

The admiral took the abyssal princess in his hands. She started to blush a little.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Actually, you want even more than happiness for me right ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' Awawawa...<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes, but for this I'm sure nobody will allow me that. Let's let the things go naturally for now.

The admiral came back to his office with Destroyer Hime and Inazuma. Ooyodo, the real one, awaited for him.

'''Ooyodo :''' So you made your decision right ? Guess we can't complain about it.<br />'''Myschin :''' No complains will be allowed on the fact that now, an abyssal being is living in our base.<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Yes admiral, we will follow your orders.<br />'''Myschin :''' Actually Ooyodo you can dismiss, I will not let you be the secretary forever.<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Can I still keep my job as the mission's secretary ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Of course.<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Thank you admiral.

----

Flashback, just after the fleet managed to win against Destroyer Hime.

'''Myschin :''' We did it girls ! Now I just have to save the Destroyer Hime before she sank too deep.<br />'''Kikuzuki :''' How are you gonna do that ?<br />'''Myschin :''' By summoning a [http://magiccards.info/cfx/en/30.html leviathan] !<br />'''Kikuzuki :''' Whoah !

Then a huge sea serpent dive into the ocean and managed to grab Destroyer Hime's body.

'''Inazuma :''' Are you really sure about your decision ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes, everything will be fine.<br />'''Natori :''' Ah, wait a second admiral, I can see a new comrade who approach.<br />'''Myschin :''' A new comrade ? A sister of Urakaze ?<br />'''[[Ooyodo]] :''' Admiral, Light Cruiser Ooyodo has joined the battle lines. Please leave the fleet administration & supervision to me.

The admiral has his chin touching the ground.

'''Myschin :''' SERIOUSLY ?! Are you kidding me right now ?!<br />'''Ooyodo :''' I am not admiral. Your fleet managed to found me around here so now you won't have to ask me about the administration through the television in the base.<br />'''Myschin :''' Awawa... But I'm just a 1-month assigned admiral, are you fine to come in our base now ?<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Anytime is good. If you need help, then I'll help you, don't worry !<br />'''Myschin :''' Oh... I see... Actually I have some things to tell you, about how I see the whole war and everything. If you are really coming back with us, then don't say anything about the fact that I also bring an abyssal ship with us !<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Oh... Right, admiral. I won't say anything...

- End of the Flashback -

----

In the abyssal place...

'''Hime#1 :''' Bad news ! Destroyer Hime lost to this admiral !<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Oh well, that girl was too hasty after all. I'll give her a lot of love when she will came back. It should be soon right ?<br />'''Hime#1 :''' Actually... There is a worse news. It seems that Destroyer Hime was kidnapped by the admiral of the fleet...<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Whaaat are you saying ?!<br />'''Hime#3 :''' IT IS MY TURN YET ?! I WANT TO SINK SOMEONE RIGHT NOW !!<br />'''Hime#2 :''' Calm down you ! Your turn will maybe not come if our new comrade doing her job fine with the Aircraft Carrier Onis sisters.<br />'''Hime#3 :''' GROAAAR !! I WANT TO FIIIGHT !!<br />'''Hime#4 :''' That girl is too hot-blooded. I will save Destroyer Hime-chan MYSELF ! I'm her best friend after all !

----

At the naval base, in the evening.

On the Communication Network.

'''Myschin :''' Finally managed to finish E-1 and even managed to bring back Destroyer Hime and Ooyodo !<br />'''Suna :''' Good for you but... Damn, even if I managed to finally clear E-3... OH GOD WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS BATTLE AGAIN ?!<br />'''Peluche :''' Hey hey, it can't be as bad as the last time because there is no Regen bar this time !<br />'''Suna :''' It's still one of my worst Traumas !<br />'''Cap'tain Fist :''' Peluche is right. With Regen bar, you don't have to worry that much.<br />'''Peluche :''' Also Myschin !<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes ?<br />'''Peluche :''' I'm so jealous about the fact that you found Ooyodo this early !!

----

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Indeed... Your friends, and even yourself, are gonna face that crazy friend of mine...<br />'''Myschin :''' We will see about that tomorrow I guess.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' By the way, why did you carry me here, I wonder ?<br />'''Myschin :''' To allow you to look at the sky... Look, it's there.

The abyssal princess raised her head and saw what she always wanted to see.

'''Destroyer Hime :''' Oh... The moon... It is... Beautiful...<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes indeed, the moon sure is beautiful this night...<br />'''Inazuma, watching from a distance and blushing :''' Awawawa, how could they casually talk about love just like that ?

==E-2 Combined Fleet, To The Solomon Islands !==

===Rough time===

3rd day of the Event.

'''Myschin :''' Good morning. How was your first night in this naval base ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' It was nice, but something bother me now...<br />'''Myschin :''' What is it ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Since you want me to live here, my friends in the abyss might want to take me back...<br />'''Myschin :''' ... So the abyssals also care about their relationships...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' You have no ideas on how deep can be our relations...

Suddenly, one of the eldrazi creature came to see the admiral.

'''Myschin :''' What ? An abyssal fleet was spotted near the naval base ?!<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... Oh dear, it must be "her".<br />'''Myschin :''' Who ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' My best friend in the abyss, actually...<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Admiral, what should we do ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I hoped for my friends to help me about the composition of a combined fleet, but it look like I will need your help Ooyodo.<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Affirmative admiral.

----

'''Myschin :''' This is my first time ever for making a combined fleet actually. I hope that everything will be okay.

Behind the admiral were Fusou, Yamashiro, Kako, Ashigara, Shouhou, Ryuujou and Fumizuki, Nagatsuki, Hiei, Yayoi, Maya and Sendai.

'''Nagatsuki :''' Are you really sure about your choice admiral ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes, even you have a role to play. Some bad things may occur, but it won't stop us to trying again and again.<br />'''Nagatsuki, blushing a little :''' Yes... We will do our best...<br />'''Inazuma :''' Why I am not in the fleet ?<br />'''Myschin :''' You are our strongest Destroyer for now so if the situation needs to, you will go, don't worry.<br />'''Kako :''' Where is Furutaka by the way ?<br />'''Myschin :''' She said she wanted to wait for your return.<br />'''Kako :''' Ohoh, I see...<br />'''Shouhou :''' Are you sure that Ryuujou and me will be enough for aerial battles ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Actually, I saw the map of the battle and I hope that you can take the light path with this Surface Task Force.<br />'''Sendai :''' Did you put me here because there will be night battles ?<br />'''Myschin :''' At least one I guess, the abyssal flagship must be a strong opponent to force us to use a combined fleet.

And so the combined fleet, led by Kako, went to confront the enemy fleet.

'''Ryuujou :''' Enemy fleet spotted !<br />'''Ashigara :''' Oh my, a Ri-class flagship already ?<br />'''Fusou :''' Don't worry, we will protect the Destroyers.<br />'''Yayoi :''' Isn't that our role ?<br />'''Kako :''' Well, we are a Surface task force, so we will attack first.

The fleet managed to easily win this first battle.

'''Fusou :''' Be careful, there are submarines around here...<br />'''Yayoi :''' Leave it to us.

And another moment later.

'''Ryuujou :''' Enemy fleet spotted !<br />'''Maya :''' It's just another Ri-class Flagship, nothing to worry about.<br />'''Sendai :''' Meh, there is no night battle, it's not fun.<br />'''Ri-class Flagship :''' Kuh, we won't let you pass !<br />'''Ashigara :''' Bring it on !

A battle began, until Kako was heavily damaged.

'''Kako :''' Youuu ! You perverted son of a bitch !<br />'''Ri-class Elite :''' Don't insult my sister !!

Then Ryuujou was heavily damaged as well.

'''Myschin, through microphone :''' RETREAT !!

While the fleet came back to the naval base...

'''Ri-class Elite :''' Are you alright sister ?!<br />'''Ri-class Flagship :''' Nothing to really worry about. Thoses shipgirls must not disturb our resources convoys.<br />'''Ri-class Elite :''' But they will come back for sure, right ?<br />'''Ri-class Flagship :''' Then we will do our best to stop them !

----

'''Myschin :''' Let's say it was an accident...<br />'''Kako :''' But admiral, if I'm still the flagship and if I get heavily damaged again, then we will be forced to retreat again.<br />'''Myschin :''' This kind of things can happen again. It's not like we will experience the Okinoshima randomness again. You just have to survive the battles here, and we can't go any easier than that. For now, take a rest, then you will go again.<br />'''Combined fleet :''' Yes admiral !

But for the second sortie, when the combined fleet reached again the third battle node, Ashigara was heavily damaged.

'''Ashigara :''' Shit ! I can't believe I've taken this much damage...<br />'''Myschin, through microphone :''' Retreat again !

Later at the base.

'''Myschin :''' Welp, I tried to go without the advices from my mentor after all...<br />'''Ashigara :''' Admiral, please don't search for justifications everytime...<br />'''Myschin :''' But it's again in that third battle that we are forced to retreat, I wonder why...

The admiral looked at the data gathered by everyone.

'''Myschin, stunned :''' ... No way ! They can't know that I'm searching for Harusame !<br />'''Inazuma :''' What's the matter admiral ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Some other admirals have reported to have found Harusame in the next area !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' It's an abyssal convoy line... It explain a lot of things.<br />'''Myschin :''' Now I know where we will go if we can't go too deep in this Event.<br />'''Kako :''' If we can reach that node first...<br />'''Myschin :''' I trust all of you girls. We will get there sooner or later.

Later, when the fleet was about to sortie again, an eldrazi came to see the admiral on the port.

'''Myschin :''' What now ? What happened ? ... A message from the abyssal flagship ?! Let's see... Hu ?<br />'''Recorded message :''' "Yo ! So it's YOU who have kidnapped my best friend hu ?! How dare you ! I will wait for you to come in person so I will beat your face and bring Warusame-chan back !!"<br />'''Myschin :''' What was that ?!<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' It's from someone who has some sense of disproportion...<br />'''Myschin :''' I have no choice but to go it seems... Please stay here for now.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' I have no other choice for now.<br />'''Myschin :''' Inazuma, I'm counting on you to watch the base.<br />'''Inazuma :''' Y-Yes admiral-nanodesu !

The combined fleet and the admiral left to go meet the abyssal flagship.

===Light Cruiser Oni's determination===

'''Myschin :''' It's strange...<br />'''Fusou :''' Yes, the Ri-class from the third battle let us pass quite easily...<br />'''Myschin :''' They must had to follow the orders of the abyssal flagship after all. Also, we didn't found anything at all at the abyssal convoy line...<br />'''Maya :''' Admiral, the probabilities to find a rare ship in those waters are very low, I doubt that you are that lucky to find her on your first try...<br />'''Myschin :''' True enough...<br />'''Shouhou :''' Admiral... Our planes spotted a strange place on the next island.<br />'''Yamashiro :''' Is that... A music scene ?

Then out of nowhere, spotlights illuminate the stage.

'''All :''' Whoah ?!<br />'''XXX :''' OHOHOHOH ! Look like our guests are here !

Several smoke explosions occured on the scene, then a figure emerges in the smoke. It was a girl with black long hairs, an idol outfit and... No legs at all.

'''[[Light Cruiser Demon|Light Cruiser Oni]], holding a microphone :''' HEEELLOOO EVERYBODYYY ! IT'S YOUR FAVORITE ABYSSAL IDOL ! THE ONE AND ONLY LIGHT CRUISER ONI !

Music and special effects resounded from all sides.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Sooo ! YOU are the admiral who kidnapped my dear Warusame-chan, right ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I didn't kidnapped her ! I saved her from sinking again !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni, laughing :''' Ohohoh, you don't need to lie to me ! When we sink, we return to the abyss, so yes you kidnapped her.<br />'''Myschin :''' ...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Give her back now !<br />'''Myschin :''' She's not here !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Fine ! I'll sink your fleet then I'll save her myself !<br />'''Myschin :''' We will not let you go as you want ! No matter how strong you are, you can't go against a combined fleet all by yourself !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Who said that I'm all alone ? Fellow abyssals fans, it's time to attack !

Several abyssal ships, with 2 Ru-class Elite amoung them, emerged from the stage to face the admiral's fleet.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Now... Sink into the depth... Which you can't surface again ![[File:KanColle-150812-18563514.png|thumb|400px]]

A fierce battle began between the two forces until the admiral's fleet win at Yasen thanks to Sendai.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Impressive ! So you can defend yourself very well as I can see, but it's futile ! I will bring back Warusame no matter how many tries it will take !<br />'''Myschin :''' My girls will come back to see you again ! And they will convince you to leave us alone !

Back at the naval base...

'''Myschin :''' Man, that was a though battle...<br />'''Inazuma :''' Welcome back-nanodesu.<br />'''Myschin :''' Those who need to take a rest, do it.<br />'''Sendai :''' That night battle was awesome !<br />'''Myschin :''' Maybe, but several girls were damaged and hurt... And since it's a combined fleet, the resupply will be more important.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' So, you've met Light Cruiser Oni ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah, she's... Special. Indeed she has this disproportion sense...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' She will do everything to make me feel good. She is very protective toward me...<br />'''Myschin :''' ... I don't mind if she want to stay here too...<br />'''Ooyodo :''' Admiral, I don't think this a good idea.<br />'''Naka :''' SO ADMIRAL !<br />'''Myschin :''' Naka ?!<br />'''Naka :''' I heard you met an abyssal idol ?!<br />'''Myschin :''' Well, she said she was one, indeed.<br />'''Naka :''' I'm gonna slap that *Bip* and prove that I'm the only idol here !<br />'''Sendai, hitting Naka in the neck to make her faint :''' Right, right, now go sleep a little would you ?

===Confusing ship===

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Mufufufu, well done shipgirls, but I'm still standing !<br />'''Fusou :''' She is strong...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Now go back before I will sink you all !

'''Myschin :''' What happened ?<br />'''Ryuujou :''' The enemy has a strong armor, and it's hard to hit her even in Yasen.<br />'''Maya :''' And those Ru-classes Elite are strong too...<br />'''Fumizuki :''' They are meanie girls~<br />'''Myschin :''' You all need to take a rest for now, thoses battles are hard after all.<br />'''Ashigara :''' Maybe we just get lucky when we won the first time ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Maybe, maybe not, just because we have it hard doesn't mean it's actually hard. We are not really prepared after all...

Later in the day...

'''Kako, through microphone :''' Admiral ? We did it ! We managed to win against the Light Cruiser Oni with a total victory !<br />'''Myschin :''' Oh, that's good to heard. Please come back as soon as possible<br />'''Kako :''' Actually, we also have found a new comrade.<br />'''Myschin :''' HARUSAME ?!<br />'''Kako :''' Nope, sorry admiral.<br />'''Myschin :''' Maybe I dream a little too much...<br />'''Inazuma :''' Cheer up commander, we have plenty of time to search for her.<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah, it's true.

After the fleet came back, the girls brought their new comrade to the admiral's office.

'''[[Noshiro]] :''' Second light cruiser of the Agano-class, Noshiro, has arrived. Glad to meet you !<br />'''Myschin :''' ... Wow ! Agano...<br />'''Noshiro :''' I'm Noshiro !!<br />'''Myschin :''' Ah sorry, I mean, Agano-class... You are quite a famous ship aren't you ?<br />'''Noshiro :''' Do you really think so ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah, I heard that since IBS, you are quite difficult to found... OK except maybe your sister Agano who apparently showed up a lot during the Spring 2015 Event...<br />'''Noshiro :''' Agano-nee is always so carefree, I have to look after her so much...<br />'''Myschin :''' But she's not here yet... Sorry again if I mistook you for Agano.<br />'''Noshiro :''' Well maybe you will find Agano somewhere in this area...<br />'''Myschin :''' I guess Yahagi and Sakawa are rarer...<br />'''Noshiro :''' I'll said that Yahagi is the proudest among us. Her devotion to Yamato can't be matched... Sakawa is very shy unless Nagato is around...<br />'''Myschin :''' Right, Nagato... Such a prestigious ship that I don't have...<br />'''Noshiro :''' Ah ? You're not a fan of Large Scale Constructions ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I'm a newly-assigned admiral after all, Nagato isn't my priority. I want to find Harusame most than her.<br />'''Noshiro :''' By the way...<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes ?<br />'''Noshiro :''' Why there is an abyssal princess here ?!

Noshiro was poiting to Destroyer Hime who was setting in the couch in the office.

'''Myschin :''' She's here because of a selfish desire of my own and I won't allow anyone to hurt her. We came to a agreement to let her live in this base.<br />'''Noshiro :''' Ah, I'm sorry admiral...<br />'''Myschin :''' No need to worry, it's a quite a recent action after all. You can dismiss now. The combined fleet will take a rest and will go after Light Cruiser Oni in the evening.

===Rough time, round 2===

'''Ryuujou :''' Oh no~ ! I'm in a too much of a pinch !<br />'''Kako :''' Retreat !

Back at the naval base...

'''Myschin :''' That situation remind me about Okinoshima Island again... Should we go with a heavier fleet ?<br />'''Shouhou :''' That would mean to take another route with much stronger ennemies...<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah, it's not really a good idea...<br />'''Ryuujou :''' Sorry for being too weak...<br />'''Myschin :''' Nah, it's fine. Let's try something else. Ryuujou, you will be the Flagship this time.<br />'''Ryuujou :''' Eh ? For real ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Being the flagship mean you are a little more safer than the others...<br />'''Shouhou :''' But what if I get hit ?<br />'''Myschin :''' It's a risk we can take.

And during the next sortie, Shouhou took a hit who damaged her... But not enough to put his life in danger.

'''Maya :''' Are you alright ?<br />'''Shouhou :''' Yes but... I can't launch planes in my condition...<br />'''Myschin, through microphone :''' Please continue. At least if you can reach the abyssal convoy, it would be great.

The fleet managed to reach the abyssal convoy, but Fusou took a dangerous hit and no new comrade were found in the area. Later, after several sorties who all ended in failures, a exhausted combined fleet managed to reach Light Cruiser Oni's place again.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Ohohoh, don't count on me to show mercy to you, despicable shipgirls !

And even if the abyssal idol took some damages, the abyssal fleet managed to win the battle this time.

'''Myschin :''' Guess we are reaching our limits now...<br />'''Fusou :''' Admiral, as strong and fearful I can be, I'm feeling really exhausted now, please let us take a break.<br />'''Myschin :''' Of course, there is no point to sortie again today... We will see tomorrow if things can turn into better results.

Later in the night...

'''Myschin :''' To be fair, our results aren't that bad... I think we can at least win against that Light Cruiser Oni.<br />'''Inazuma :''' More important admiral, our resource consumption is quite high, aren't it ? We should be careful...<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes indeed. But with the combined fleet, our expeditions can't be that efficient. I need to think again about the best solution to solve all of this...

===The resolution of everything===

4th day of the Event.

'''Sendai :''' Admiral, why did you called me ? Do you want to have a night battle with me ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Actually Sendai, I have thinked about everything and I came to a conclusion. You need to reach Kai ni.<br />'''Sendai :''' Ohoh... You know what it mean right ?<br />'''Myschin :''' The fact that you will turn into a night battle beast ?<br />'''Sendai :''' Oh, more than this... I will become a real ninja.<br />'''Myschin, sparkling eyes :''' ...<br />'''Sendai :''' And I will want to have more night battles with you admiral.<br />'''Myschin :''' As I have told everyone before, you know I don't want to be involved into the sexual meaning of the night battles.<br />'''Sendai :''' What a waste but it's your choice and I will respect it.<br />'''Myschin :''' Well, Kisaragi and Murasame keep trying to attack me at night in order to have intimates relations with me. If you reach Kai ni, then I could sleep without worrying about those two.<br />'''Sendai, smirking face :''' And what I decide to join those two ?<br />'''Myschin :''' You will not do that, you aren't that horny after all.<br />'''Sendai :''' Maybe because I can control myself more than them.<br />'''Myschin :''' I have faith in you Sendai.<br />'''Sendai :''' Right, no need to play it anymore. When my training will start ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Right now, we still need to stop Light Cruiser Oni, who has send us an ultimatum. If we can't stop her in less than 48 hours, she will come and take back Destroyer Hime.<br />'''Sendai :''' Ahahah, you don't want her to leave after all.<br />'''Myschin :''' Please be the flagship of the second fleet and stop Light Cruiser Oni.<br />'''Sendai :''' Right, leave it to me !

And the Combined Fleet managed to reach Light Cruiser Oni's place again.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Prepare to face your fate and sink !<br />'''Sendai :''' Not so fast you stubborn abyssal girl, I'm here to stop you !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni, laughing :''' Riiight, you alone ? What you can do against me ?<br />'''Sendai :''' I'll be the one who will stop your rampage against our base.<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' My love for Warusame-chan can't be matched.<br />'''Sendai :''' Ufufu, then let's if you can surpass my addiction to night battles !

The combined fleet managed to win with a perfect victory thank to Sendai's efforts in night battle.

'''Sendai :''' See ?<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' ... Right... Obviously, I underestimated you...<br />'''Sendai :''' Want to give up now ?<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni, seriously pissed :''' LIKE HELL I WOULD GIVE UP !! I'M GONNA KILL ALL OF YOU !!<br />'''Sendai :''' Woah, that murderous intent ! Let's head back !<br />'''Ru-class Elite :''' Please calm down oni-sama...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' FUCK NO ! LET'S RAID THEIR BASE NOW AND BRING BACK WARUSAME !<br />'''Ru-class Elite :''' You need to take a rest, your wounds are not healed yet.<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Tch ! Should I pass my nerves on the girl we captured earlier ?<br />'''Ru-class Elite :''' I think it's a bad idea. One of our superior want to keep her for her personal use...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' ... Right, I rather want that lolicon molesting a shipgirl rather than my beloved Warusame. Call her now, she will help us to deal the final blow to those shipgirls.

----

Later, 2 girls with white hairs came to Light Cruiser Oni's place. Both had a red aura around them.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Uh ? She can't come ?! Why ?!<br />'''[[Battleship Ta-Class|Ta-class Battleship]] Elite :''' Well, you know her, she's currently molesting the foreign shipgirl the abyss have captured some days ago...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Curse that lolicon !<br />'''Ta-class Elite #2 :''' Fear not oni-sama, we will protect you !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Oh yeah, you are feared by a lot of admirals after all !<br />'''Ru-class Elite :''' As for us, we will going to the airfield area. We need to look after the hime here...

----

At the naval base.

'''Fusou :''' The combined fleet has returned...<br />'''Myschin :''' Something wrong ?<br />'''Sendai :''' Hum yeah, that abyssal oni has snapped. She's like ready to kill anything that isn't abyssal.<br />'''Nagatsuki :''' I think it's the perfect time to finish her off for good.<br />'''Ryuujou :''' Yeah, it's the last dance.<br />'''Myschin :''' You all need to take a rest. If we can win against her, that would be great... Also, who is this person with you ?<br />'''Yamashiro :''' Ah... We totally forgot about her...<br />'''[[Kinugasa]] :''' Ye~s, It's Miss Kinugasa's debut ! Together with Aoba, take good care of me !<br />'''Myschin :''' Urks ! Are you Aoba's sister ?<br />'''Kinugasa :''' Ye~s, why did you ask ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I hope you are not as hotblooded as her when it comes to find rumors and scoops...<br />'''Kinugasa :''' Pff, this is my sister's predilection field. I'm very good to entertain the others you know ?<br />'''Myschin :''' If you say so... You can dismiss now. Ashigara will guide you to Aoba's location.

Later on...

'''Myschin :''' Are you all ready ?<br />'''All shipgirls in the combined fleet :''' YEAH !<br />'''Fusou :''' Everything will be alright, yes.<br />'''Maya :''' I hope so, I honestly feel too much tired of all this shit !<br />'''Kako :''' But Maya, it's a part of the operation and we're not that strong. Of course we have to face difficulties.<br />'''Maya :''' Yeah I know...<br />'''Ryuujou :''' Take example on the destroyers...<br />'''Yayoi, sparkling :''' If we win, then I will ask the commander to hug me for the entire day.<br />'''Nagatsuki, sparkling :''' Hey, what about us ?!<br />'''Fumizuki, sparkling :''' Eheheheh~<br />'''Maya :''' Ah, the youth...

----

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' This is it ! The final climax of my performance ! It's the end of the road for you shipgirls !<br />'''Hiei :''' Wait ! Since when you changed your escort ?!<br />'''Ta-class Elite #1 :''' Ufufufu, we are Oni-sama's fans too !<br />'''Ta-class Elite #2 :''' Now please die !<br />'''Fusou :''' Oh dear... Such misfortune.<br />'''Yamashiro :''' Uuuuh, they are stronger than us.<br />'''Maya :''' It mean nothing ! You can win against them right ?<br />'''Ashigara :''' Oh yeah, Victory is calling for us !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Sink into the depth which you won't surface again !

To Light Cruiser oni's disppointment, Fusou and Yamashiro managed to win against the Ta-class Elite sisters.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Curse you engagement !<br />'''Ashigara :''' She's the sole enemy left ! Go go go !

Light Cruiser Oni was forced to undergo all attacks against her...

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' RAAAAH ! ENOUGH ALREADY !!<br />'''Hiei :''' Hieeeee, she sustains THAT MUCH and she's still alive ?!<br />'''Shouhou :''' It explain why we have to use a combined fleet to deal with her.<br />'''Yamashiro :''' But we managed to sink even the Ta-classes...<br />'''Sendai :''' But she's a Oni after all.<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' You can't win against me ! And I'll save Warusame !<br />'''Myschin, through microphone :''' It's not over yet. Sendai, do you know what time it is now ?<br />'''Sendai, fully sparkled :''' NIGHT BATTLE TIME ?!<br />'''Myschin :''' Yes, now go !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Tch, come if you dare !

Sendai tried to shoot the abyssal oni twice but she used her fists to deviate both attacks.

'''Sendai :''' Whaaat ?!<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' It's futile ! Now eat this !

She targeted Nagatsuki and heavily damaged her.

'''Nagatsuki :''' AAAAAH !<br />'''Fumizuki :''' Onee-chan !<br />'''Yayoi :''' Nagatsuki !<br />'''Hiei :''' Don't you have any shame to attack a kid like that ?!<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Don't your admiral have any shame to separate two best friends together ?!<br />'''All shipgirls :''' ...<br />'''Myschin :''' But I didn't know that to begin with !<br />'''Maya :''' Enough talking !

Maya fired on Light Cruiser Oni...

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Ahahah, you missed your chance...

But the heavy cruiser physically launch her canons on the abyssal oni.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' The hell ?!

But at the same moment, Maya managed to reach to the closest possible to Light Cruiser Oni.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Ah...<br />'''Maya :''' EAT SHIT AND SHUT UP NOW ! [[File:KanColle-150813-17285945.png|thumb|400px]]

Maya managed to punch Light Cruiser Oni's face with so much force that the abyssal oni flew in the sky and fell on his stage, totally defeated.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Ah... It can't be...<br />'''Maya :''' Yes it can damnit !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Is... That... So... Go ahead... and do... your worst... beyond here is...

The abyssal light cruiser fainted.

'''Ashigara :''' VICTORY !<br />'''Hiei :''' HOORAY !<br />'''Myschin, through microphone :''' Woah ! Great job girls ! You are the best !<br />'''Maya :''' Tch, she pissed me that much, but it's good to empty the frustration with a good punch !<br />'''Kako :''' Like a beast...<br />'''Maya :''' Got a problem with that ?<br />'''Kako :''' No, no at all !<br />'''Maya :''' Fine !<br />'''Ryuujou :''' Girls, my planes tell me that there is a shipgirl around.<br />'''XXX :''' Eh ? Someone's here ? HEEELP PLEASE !

----

After the fleet leave the stage's place...

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Guess... I'm not determinate enough to save Warusame...

Then the abyssal oni spotted a weird creature who was looking at her.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' The hell is that ? It's scarier than our scariest units !<br />'''Recorded video :''' Can you hear me ?<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Hu ?

Then the face of the admiral appeared on a screen holded by the creature.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' You... You realise what have you done ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Yeah, I'm really sorry... But to tell you the truth, I made my decision to save Destroyer Hime since she joined the abyssal fleet, before you joined too...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Kuhu... Maybe, but you watched things for distance until recently. I was with Warusame since I joined the abyssal fleet, my bond is stronger !<br />'''Myschin :''' Mine is deeper.<br />'''Destroyer Hime, appeared on the screen as well :''' Nakano-chan...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' ... !<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... Please don't hate me or this person... He... He really want to put an end to the whole war...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Because he win against me doesn't mean he can bring peace to this war.<br />'''Myschin :''' Of course I can't do that in such a short period of time, but please, let Destroyer Hime stay with me. It's a first step to improve the relations between humans, shipgirls and abyssals.<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' ... OK, I'll accept with 2 conditions.<br />'''Myschin :''' Which are ?<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' I want you to allow Warusame to come back if she want to come back sometimes...<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Right, I still have friends in the abyss...<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' And, most importantly, please come to see my idol performances sometimes !<br />'''Myschin :''' ... Yeah, for sure ! I am still looking for several shipgirls who can be found around, so yeah, count me in to come see your lives sometimes.<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' Then it's decided. I'm looking to see you before the end of the Operation !

The eldrazi creature flew away.

'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' But first... This place need to be repaired.

===A new delinquent has been assigned to the base ?===

Back at the naval base.

'''Myschin :''' Welcome back everyone.<br />'''Ryuujou :''' We won ! Are you gonna praise us ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Of course !<br />'''Ryuujou :''' YAY !<br />'''Ashigara :''' Maya is the true MVP after all.<br />'''Maya, blushing :''' Heeey, it's embarassing you know ?<br />'''XXXX :''' Come on aneki ! It sound so cool !!<br />'''Myschin :''' Eh ?<br />'''Maya :''' Ah, right. Admiral, there was a imprisoned shipgirl in the abyssal's stage, so we decided to take her with us.

The admiral looked at the new girl, who had long red hairs and a familiar uniform.

'''[[Kawakaze]] :''' YO ! The 9th Shiratsuyu-class Destroyer, Kawakaze of the revised Shiratsuyu-class. Nice to meet you ! Ah, about the reading of my name, do not get it wrong ! It's KAWAKAZE, not Ekaze !<br />'''Myschin :''' Ekaze and Kawakaze doesn't sound alike at all ! I won't make that kind of mistake but...<br />'''Kawakaze :''' Whaaat ? Are you interested in me I wonder ?<br />'''Myschin :''' You... Are a Shiratsuyu-class destroyer ?!<br />'''Kawakaze :''' Yeah, can't you tell by looking at me ?<br />'''Myschin :''' ...<br />'''Kawakaze :''' What ?<br />'''Myschin :''' It's... Such a great news. 6 of your sisters are already here you know ?<br />'''Kawakaze :''' Oh-oooh ? My anekis are there . It has to be expected from any admiral right ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Actually I'm kinda new...<br />'''Kawakaze :''' ...<br />'''Myschin :''' But I'll do my best !<br />'''Kawakaze :''' Enough talk, where are my anekis ?

Then the whole Shiratsuyu-class came to greet Kawakaze.

'''Shiratsuyu :''' It's actually our little sister ! Yay !<br />'''Murasame :''' Oh my Kawakaze, you're so cute.<br />'''Kawakaze, blushing :''' Eeeeeh ?<br />'''Shiratsuyu :''' Don't be shy !

Shiratsuyu and Murasame hugged Kawakaze from both sides.

'''Kawakaze, blushing and nosebleeding :''' * Gaaah, Aneki's breasts are so big, I'm so jealous ! *<br />'''Samidare :''' Are you alright ?!<br />'''Kawakaze :''' Yeah yeah, don't worry, it's nothing.<br />'''Suzukaze :''' Hey Kawakaze, I hope you'll be super cool.<br />'''Yuudachi :''' Little sister-poi, little sister-poi~<br />'''Kawakaze :''' It's embarassing to be the center of attention like that eheheh...

The admiral noticed that Shigure didn't came to greet her sister.

'''Myschin :''' Where is Shigure ?<br />'''Fusou :''' I think she want to greet her sister while they will be alone.<br />'''Myschin :''' Eh ? Don't tell me it's another trauma from the past ?<br />'''Fusou :''' It is, indeed.

A few moments later, most of the shipgirls returned to their normal activities, but the admiral told Kawakaze to stay in the office.

'''Kawakaze :''' You remind me of someone ya know ?<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' ... Can't you tell be looking at me ?<br />'''Kawakaze :''' Right in the moment, I can't but I'm sure I'll remember later... By the way admiral, you are totally interested in me right ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I think I love you and your delinquent side but...<br />'''Kawakaze :''' But ?<br />'''Myschin :''' There is someone who want to see you alone. Come here...

Then Shigure entered the office.

'''Kawakaze :''' AH ! Shigure-aneki...

Without saying anything, Shigure jump on Kawakaze and began to hug her intensely.

'''Kawakaze :''' WHOAH !<br />'''Shigure, crying :''' This time ! You will stay with me !! I'll protect you no matter what !!<br />'''Kawakaze :''' Calm down Aneki, there is no way I'll disappear like that last time.<br />'''Shigure :''' I'll make sure it never happen !!

Shigure didn't release her sister yet.

'''Shigure :''' Yes, this time, you will stay with me and live.

Without saying anything, the admiral took Destroyer Hime in his hands and leave the office, leaving Shigure and Kawakaze sharing a tender moment together.

'''Inazuma :''' Commander, why are you here ?<br />'''Myschin :''' Shigure wanted to meet Kawakaze alone for historical reasons. I think it's good to leave them alone for a certain time.<br />'''Inazuma :''' By the way commander; I have to tell you something-nanodesu...<br />'''Myschin :''' What ?

Inazuma gave a note to the admiral.

'''Myschin :''' W-WHAT ?! HOW ?!<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' What's wrong ?<br />'''Myschin :''' This note is saying that our naval base can now welcome 20 more shipgirls and there is another key for repairs / constructions docks.<br />'''Destroyer Hime :''' Isn't that a good news ?<br />'''Inazuma :''' But the commander only asked for an expansion once, not twice.<br />'''Myschin :''' And thoses expansions are not free !<br />'''Inazuma :''' Do you think an error has occured ?<br />'''Myschin :''' I don't know but... The Headquarters are gonna be mad at me right ?!

----

On the Communication Network

'''Myschin :''' So that's what happened...<br />'''Suna :''' ...<br />'''Peluche :''' Actually, thoses mistakes, even if they are rares, are not the admirals's fault. So really, you can enjoy your free expansion without worrying at all.<br />'''Myschin :''' Really ?<br />'''Peluche :''' Yeah, so now your base can welcome 140 shipgirls... Something tell me that you will like to have such place in the near future.<br />'''Suna :''' You managed to clear E2 but let me warn you. E3 is on another level even with the easiest conditions.<br />'''Myschin :''' Oh OK...

----

Abyssal place

'''Hime #1 :''' Welcome back Nakano !<br />'''Light Cruiser Oni :''' I've lost... I was too hot-blooded to save Warusame...<br />'''Hime #2 :''' IT IS MY TURN YET ?! GROAAAAAR !!<br />'''Hime #1 :''' Calm down sweetie, it's not your turn yet !<br />'''Hime #2 :''' NONONONO, I'LL GO KILL THEM ALL RIGHT NOOOW !!<br />'''Hime #3 :''' Oh no my dear, you're not going anywhere before I go see myself first.<br />'''Hime #2 :''' EH ?
