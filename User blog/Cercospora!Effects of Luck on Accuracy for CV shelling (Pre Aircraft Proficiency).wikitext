==Intro==
This study was done a while ago (jk a long time ago) before Aircraft Proficiency mechanic was introduced in Summer 2015. The purpose of this study is to determine if the Luk stat has any effect on accuracy. The current proposed accuracy formula to this date is:

This study will confirm whether if Luk affects accuracy. If it does then by how much.

==Conclusion==
Although this study was interrupted before I gathered enough samples, there's still enough data to make some speculations. It seems that Luck does indeed increase accuracy. Zuikaku is 3% more accurate than Shoukaku overall, but Zuikaku's targeted enemies' mean evasion is slightly lower than Shoukaku's. Also enemies with 10 evasion will be hit 97% of the time, so no conclusion can be drawn from this data. Shoukaku out performed Zuikaku against enemies with evasion 30-39 by 5%. However, low sample size marks this result as invalid. The most interesting finding is against the enemies of evasion 40-55, where Zuikaku is 8% more accurate than Shoukaku. There's approx. 300 samples for this section so it is very likely that Zuikaku is more accurate than Shoukaku. It's hard to say by how much, but there does seem to be a difference.
