My bare bones, one page visual of the key destroyers to keep as of 2/18/2016.

Shigure - I placed her at the top as much for aesthetics (6-7 in the 2 rows as opposed to 5-8) as anything else. For admirals with fewer high level ships, CIs are essential as they may be the only way to score a victory/map clear.

Hatsushimo - You can run a mixed AACI and mixed CI setup using a 10cm HA+AAFD, a Torpedo and an air radar. Master of none, but has interesting/quirky utility.

Ushio - I was tempted to drop her entirely from the list. She's probably the "worst of the rest".Â
