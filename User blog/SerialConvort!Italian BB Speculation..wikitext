The event is soon. When does it occur? April 28th. Two of the ships will be a Italian BBs.

Now please look at this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_battleship_Vittorio_Veneto

Ok so heres my evidence, first of all, the event happens on April 28th, and Vittorio Veneto was commissioned on April 28th. Coincidence? Highly unlikely.

And another thing, Vittorio Veneto is the second BATTLESHIP of the Littorio Class and served in the ITALIAN Regia Marina (Royal Army) during World War 2. This is my thoughts on who the next Italian BB.

And if I happen to be wrong, drown me in cereal while playing a tune on the worlds smallest Violin.
