Nagato and company... this is basically a skirmish to find a short way to defeat the boss. All we just need, is intel on how to get pass to long ass path of Abyssals.... (Admiral)

I hope so, I don't want this to be slllloooooowwww.... (Shimakaze)

Agreed to this. Also, thank you for welcoming and giving me an opportunity to join in with Kurita fleet (Kiso)

That's the thing. we need every firepower we have, and this is one way to counter mess with the Abyssal's tactics. (Admiral)

You sure make the best plans Teitoku, I wanna hug you.... (rolling jump)...(Kongou)
