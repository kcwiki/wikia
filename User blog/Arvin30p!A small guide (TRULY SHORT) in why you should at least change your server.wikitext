'''Dislaimer:''' ''This Blog post purpose is to make others think, not to force them to move away from Hashirajima Anchorage because ot toxic rankings...''




Anyhow, Since Kancolle has celebrated it's 5th year anniversary, they now give you the chance to change servers...

So, what's the point in that? Simple, they want to make sure that you'll have an easier time on the server you wanted to transfer in case you are feeling toxic due to ranking.




'''But...'''




It's not for ranking purposes that devs asks you to change servers (sadly, not all will be transferred at all.), well...

I must say, changing servers do serve some purpose other than for ranking (Because Hashirajima's ranking wars is terrible).






==Benefits:==
*First of all, you can actually got out of ranking hell... or any hell you are in right now.
*Secondly, if your server crashes on an important event (Like it always happens), being on a different server does help (unless that server crashes too at some point). Likewise to say, you can now get out of your server who crashes most of the times during events.
*Third, with the friend fleet to be implemented, It's better to be in the same server with your friend who you can trust. (Still not known what does friend fleet does at this point, so take it with a grain of salt)
*Fourth, You might be able to evade those trashy PVP fleets. Seriously, bad PVP fleets are like worms, they crawl and slowly eat you.
*Lastly, (THE MOST IMPORTANT), IF YOU ARE RANKING AND YOU ARE IN HASHIRAJIMA OR ANY SERVERS THAT HAD HARDCORE RANKERS, YOU CAN NOW MOVE OUT AND BE THE TOP OF YOUR OWN GAME. (but seriously, this is the most anticipated thing I will say anyways.)





==   ==
'''Anyways,'''

If you don't feel like moving at all because...
#you don't rank
#you don't care
#you just really don't care at all
#because you are playing a different game at this point...



'''YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO MOVE SERVERS AT ALL.'''

Anyways, have a nice day to you all.
