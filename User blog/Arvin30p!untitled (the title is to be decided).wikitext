A (not ordinary)life story.



- I was a normal person back then

- I never thought the the world would change once I stepped outside and look at the sea.

- I had thoughts of how should I live my life and living my dreams and fulfilling my ambitions while I was young, not that I am older now. afterall, I never aged once I stepped into the sea and lived 'that' life.

- We had been selected as a test subjects whether or not we could help mankind fight monsters. But in return, we became the monsters we are fighting for.

- We were locked up and never used up because no one would use us on the excuse that we might betray them and attack them instead. How pitiful.

- We lost hope back then.

- Then one day, on that special day. One man... Yes, one man rise up and challenged what is deemed impossible. Make friends of us... monsters.

- This man smiled at us and said "it'll be all right. I'm going to raise you all and make sure that you live your lives more free than what I see in you right now.'

- This man, while seemed unreliable, guided us, lived with us, fight with us, laugh with us is the first friend we ever had since we've been taken in.

- Thus in our game of House, we knew what roles we were playing.

- He was assigned in a naval base near the sea, and took us with him.

- And our lives as a 'different person' began.

- To be continued.
