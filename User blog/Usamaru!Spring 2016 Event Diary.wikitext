==Intro==
Well, this is my first time trying to actually mark down my doings during an event. This is mostly for myself and maybe, if someone finds this useful, it can be used as a notepad of what I did wrong.

==Notes==
====E-1 Hard====
E-1 was fairly easy on hard, even with mid level girls. Preboss node was a troll, but usually taiha'd only one girl, allowing me to continue thanks to FCF. Only once did [[Battleship Princess]] taiha 2 girls, one of them luckily being the 2nd fleet flagship, everyones favourite idol [[Naka Kai Ni|Naka-chan]]. Cleared the map in 6 runs, had to turn back once because a lucky critter hit the main fleet flagship [[Furutaka]].
====Delay before entering E-2====
Due to the need for fast CVLs in E-1 and the unknown factor of E-6 I had ran out of fast CVLs to use. After running a few sorties in 2-1 and 2-2 trying to catch [[Shouhou]], I decided to remodel a Chiyoda A into Chiyoda CVL Kai. Had to spend some time and resources to level it a bit and to catch modfodder for maxing armor and firepower.
====E-2 Hard====
This reminds me of Summer 2015 E-3, meaning the troll is strong in this one. Had a decent go at chipping away HP, but last dance has yet to be finished, with a few close calls (19 HP left on [[Supply Depot Princess - Damaged III|Megane-hime]]) and a few utter failures at pre-boss nodes. I'll continue with hard difficulty for now, because the boss isn't that much easier on medium, nor do I want to redo the HP chipping.

Shoutout to AbsoluteLuck, who gave me some good advice to try and save what I could. Sadly I was unable to build momentum on that and still went with Medium.
====Downgrade to E-2 Medium====
I decided to drop down to medium on this map because I lack enough boss killing power (no WG42). I'll probably regret it later when I have to deal with weaker Land-Base Aerial Support, but as I plan on doing some of the latter maps on Easy, it shouldn't be that bad. I still feel like I've failed my girls.
====E-2 Medium clear====
After hitting the wall with the same composition multiple times on medium as well, I once more asked help from the kind people on the Kancolle Wikia chat. This time Stymphalian ID.27 came to the rescue. Under strict supervision I changed the compo for a heavyer fleet, foregoing the less damaging route for more punch at the boss. In hindsight I should have done that from the start, because I reached boss 100% of the runs and with decent aim from [[Hyuuga]], I was able to finally clear E-2 and leave the obviously overly attached [[Supply Depot Princess|DJ Hime (Megane-hime)]] behind. As a parting gift, DJ hime gave me another [[Kashima]]. Onwards to Subway™and resource recovery.
====E-3 Farming - Subway™====
<span style="line-height:18.2px;">After clearing E-2 I've been hard at work trying to catch some [[U-511|Yuu]] and [[I-401|Shioi]]. My main focus right now is on Yuu, for the [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|WG42]] and [[Prototype FaT Type 95 Oxygen Torpedo Kai|FaT torps]].Thanks to the ease of farming E-3 Easy, I can also restore resources at a steady, albeit slow rate. At some point I'll probably have to turn to full-on bauxite gathering, due to carrier-heavy maps later in the event. Day 2 awarded me with [[I-401|Shioi]]. The large number of CAV and CL drops helps with maxing out stats on newly remodelled or formerly neglected girls (like the expedition-oriented Mutsuki-class). </span>

<span style="line-height:18.2px;">Days 3 and 4 were uneventful and short due to school, with no noteworthy drops. </span>

<span style="line-height:18.2px;">Day 5 rewarded me with my first [[U-511|Yuu]], hopefully not the last one, before I continue clearing in 3 days.</span>

<span style="line-height:18.2px;">After a week of farming I still only had one [[Yuu]] and one [[Shioi]] . I stopped farming on May 16th to continue with clearing.</span>
====<span style="line-height:18.2px;">E-3 Hard clear</span>====
<span style="line-height:18.2px;">Clearing E-3 on Hard was fairly easy, because it didn't require a boss kill to finish. Clearing took 8 runs, of which 2 were S-rank at boss, 5 were A-rank and 1 ended in a retreat because of unlucky double taiha at F node. There were no notable drops while clearing.</span>
====<span style="line-height:18.2px;">E-4 Hard clear</span>====
<span style="line-height:18.2px;">Having a decent stockpile of bauxite, I went with the CTF route. Using fighters from land base and [[Hatsuzuki]] to neutralize [[Aircraft Carrier Princess|CV Hime]] allowed me to clear the map with 8 runs, with 2 A-ranks, 1 retreat and 6 S-ranks. One of the S-ranks gave me [[Shoukaku]], whose absence had barred me from a number of quests.</span>
====E-5 Medium attempt====
At first I tried clearing E-5 on Medium, to get the extra interceptor. Pre-final runs were fairly successful, with a small number or retreats and mostly S-rank at boss. In comparison, a number of final runs failed, mostly with 40-ish HP left on the boss. The main reason for this was that usually both Ru battleships survived into yasen and precious attacks were wasted on them. After quite a few failed final runs I decided to downgrade to Easy to save my dwindling resources and time. Having wasted so many resources on this attempt was a big mistake and might just come back to bite me in the ass.
====E-5 Easy clear====
As I had previously been successful in almost all Medium pre-final runs, Easy wasn't that difficult. A few runs ended in retreat due to unlucky taihas, but all sorties, that reached the boss ended in S-ranks. I used 2 sorties to clear the last dance, with the first one ending in A-rank, again due to Ru meatshields. The clearing was my best run of them all, ending in a day-battle S-rank.
====E-6 Easy clear====
E-6 was an annoying map, with random routing before the boss and heavy dependance on aerial strikes. If RNG was kind to you, you didn't even make it to main fleet shelling, if it was unkind, you didn't even make it to chuuha on the boss. Thankfully I had decent preboss routing luck, making it to boss about 60% of the time, with another 10% going to boss after passing 2 more nodes and 30% failing at L-node due to double taiha. I also had decent luck with aerial strikes, taking the boss down almost every time I made it to the boss. LD was 3 attempts, with 1 ending in A-rank, 1 getting detoured and the final killing the boss before shelling began.
====E-7 Easy clear====
E-7 was a piece of cake on Easy difficulty. As long as you made it to boss and the LBAS struk home, you S-ranked. As simple as that. If LBAS didn't hit the boss, then it was very difficult to take her down. Basically your entire combined fleet was a spotter operation for you land-base bomber runs. I S-ranked every time the boss was in Line Ahead composition and A-ranked every time the boss was in Diamond composition. LD took 2 tries, with the first try having bad RNG for the land-base bomber runs and too light a fleet to kill the boss. The second try taihad boss before shelling began and was finalized into a kill during day battle, with yasen assuring S-rank victory by killing the remaining escorts.
