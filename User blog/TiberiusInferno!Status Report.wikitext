E-6E apparently doesn't like me. Currently sitting at 1000 {{Ammo}} and floating around 300 {{Fuel}}.

Using 3/4 CV always, and I mean ALWAYS, directs me to K -> M -> L -> J -> N. By this point my girls are exhausted of ammo to make a diffrerence, and not enough planes to deal nuke damage.



Using 2 CV and LHA currently, unlucky rolls have gotten her to 31 and 56. RNG is holding me down.


===What now?===
Currently, I know I'm not getting Iowa. She wasn't my primary objective anyways. (I'm partial to the Italians, even though I I got only two). So I'll try to clear E-6 for the sake of not letting Central beat me, and it's off Akizuki and Yuu farming. Light Fleets aren't too expensive anyways. Oh, and Orel Cruising for my poor resources.
