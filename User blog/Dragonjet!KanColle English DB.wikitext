==About==
As you know there are already construction and development databases, in Japanese, where you can submit your results and it'll be tallied into percentages/rates.

This project is an attempt to do the same, but for sorties. Fleet compositions and node routing will be reported by the community, and the system will tally the best fleets to use. It is also envisioned for the system to present the players with analysis interfaces that could be useful for all.
So, when you do a sortie, make sure to submit your results here:
