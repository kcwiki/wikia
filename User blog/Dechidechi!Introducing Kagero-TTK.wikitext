[[File:48296030_p0.png|thumb|380px|pixiv48296030]]because of [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=48296030 this photo] (by [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=2356928 裴C(Bae.C)]
), somebody went and linked a TTK full of Kagero love.

A Taiwan TTK, from Buin server, [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=34814 あそう] is probably the guy who married all dem kageros in the picture below. He has two twitter account, but the one where he shows-off his girls is this Twitter ([https://twitter.com/DEEPSTRIKER @DEEPSTRIKER] ). Unfortunately you need to ask permission to enter so I couldn't confirm whether he's the true god of Kagero harem.
