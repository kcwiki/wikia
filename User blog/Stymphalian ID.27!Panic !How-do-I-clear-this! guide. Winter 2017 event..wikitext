==Map 0 - Equipment setup and other info==
The equipment setup part of each map will be refering to here.
*'''BB+CA''': Standard equipment: Gun-Gun-Seaplane-Wildcard
**The Wildcard can be a radar, [[Type_3_Shell|green shell]], red shell, machine guns or night battle equipment. Usually will be radar or Red shell.
**In the case of BBV/CAV, the seaplane will of course be a bomber, and the wildcard can be another seaplane bomber.
**Support expedition: Gun-Gun-Radar-Radar
*'''CL''':
**ASW: Sonar-Sonar-Depth Charge
**Surface: Gun-Gun-Wildcard
***the wildcard can be seaplane, [[Star_Shell]] or radar.
*'''DD''':
**ASW: Sonar-Sonar-Depth Charge
**AACI: [[10cm_Twin_High-angle_Gun_Mount_+_Anti-Aircraft_Fire_Director]] x2-Air Radar
**Torpedos Cut-in: Torp-Torp-Wildcard
***the wildcard can be another torpedo, [[Star_Shell]], [[Searchlight]] or [[Skilled_Lookouts|Skilled_Lookout]]
**Transport: 3x [[Drum_Canister_(Transport_Use)]] in TP phase. or3x [[Daihatsu_Landing_Craft]] instead if possible it's a ship that's capable.
**Day battle: Gun-Gun-Wildcard
***Wildcard: radar, machine gun, torpedos.
**Support expedition: Radar-Radar-Radar
*'''CV''':
**As a rule, enough fighters to gain AS/AS+ then fill the remaining slots with bombers.
**Support expedition: 2 bomber + 2 radar, bomber on biggest slots.
'''Support expedition comp''': 2 DD - 2 BB - 2 CV. Cost roundly 300 fuel and 400 ammo per run per support fleet.
==Map 1 - Sub festival==
'''Fleet''': BB (any) - 1 CL - 2 DD - 2 more of any CL and DD (Example: BB 2CL 3DD)

'''Route''': F-I-K-M or F-J-L-M.

F and M are sub fleet. Going top route (I-K) will have 2 surface battles while bottom route (J-L) will have 1 surface battle and 1 more sub fleet. Referred route: bottom.

'''Equipment''':
*BB: Standard setup.
*CL+DD: ASW
'''Estimated resource cost per run''': 156 fuel, 174 ammo (50 baux at worst RNG possible). Plus any repair cost and support expeditions.
==Map 2 - Single Transport+HP==
'''Fleet''': 2 DD - 2 CA(V) - 2 CV. a CLT ({{ShipLink|Kiso Kai Ni}}) can replace one of the CA(V).

'''Route''': G-I-K-O-(N)-Boss

G, K and N are surface battle. O is air raid. Node N can be skipped by using at least 3 historical ship (if you are going easy, 4 will be needed in higher difficulty)

These ships are:
* CA: {{ShipLink|Nachi|Nachi/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Ashigara|Ashigara/Kai Ni}}
* CLT: {{ShipLink|Kiso|Kiso/Kai Ni}}
* CL: {{ShipLink|Abukuma|Abukuma/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Tama}}
* DD: {{ShipLink|Akebono}}, {{ShipLink|Ushio|Ushio/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Kasumi|Kasumi/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Shiranui}}

'''LBAS''': 4x bombers on TP phase, 3x bomber + 1 fighter with 5 range on HP phase ([[Reppuu]] are recommended). Send them all to boss.

'''Equipment''':
*TP
**CA(V): Standard setup. On CAV, replance Seaplane Bomber for [[Drum_Canister_(Transport_Use)]] as you see fit during TP phase.
**CLT: [[Kouhyouteki]] + any other 2.
**DD: Transport setup.
**CV: full bombers for TP phase. 
*HP
**CA(V): same as TP phase, just remove [[Drum_Canister_(Transport_Use)]] if you did use them.
**CLT: same as TP phase.
**DD: Torp cutin.
**CV: Just enough fighter for AS and bombers on remaining slots.
'''Estimated resource cost per run''':198 fuel, 218 ammo, roundly 200 baux on TP and 250 baux on HP. Plus any repair cost<span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">and support expeditions.</span>
==Map 3 - Combined Transport+HP==
The event page said that there are 3 phase, I says it's 2: Transport fleet and Surface fleet.
===Transport Fleet===
'''Main fleet''': 4 DD + 2 of any DD/CL/CAV/ AV version of Chitose and Chiyoda. CAV are best in slot, Chitose/Chiyoda as AV is just as good for people with more limited option (bring no more than 1 AV), more CL/DD are fine.

'''Escort fleet''': CL - 3 DD -2 CA. If lacking CA, bring more CL and DD.

'''"Phase 1"''':

'''Route''': Choice, you need to go to node B, C and E one time each. All node will be surface battle. Node F have BB and node G have CVL. '''Note''': if your girl are taiha and the node immediate after will be either B, C or E, it's safe to advance.

'''LBAS''': 4x long range bombers on both base. Send 1 base to node K and the other to node F or G depend on where you are going.

'''Equipment''':
*Main fleet:
**DD: transport setup.
**CAV: standard setup. Or Drums-Drums-Bomber-Bomber
**CL: same as DD.
**AV(if used): full bombers.
*Escort fleet:
**DD: day battle setup. 1 with AACI if possible.
**CL: surface setup with seaplane or radar as wildcard.
**CA: standard setup with either radar or machine gun as wildcard.
'''"Phase 2"''':

'''Route''': K-Q-T. All surface battle. Q might have enemy CLT if playing in hard. T will have combined fleet. You only need A rank at T, which equal to 8 ship sunk. When enough enemy ship sunk, night battle are only necessary when either of their fleet are fully sunk.

'''LBAS''': the setup are unchanged. 1 base go to boss, the other either split between K and Q, split between Q and boss, or focus on Q. Not using on boss are to ensure you reach boss node, our objective.

'''Equipment''': unchanged from phase 1.
===Surface Fleet===
'''Main fleet''': 4 BB - 2 CVL. If you don't have enough CVL, 1 CV 1 CA(V) can be a replacement. If you don't have enough BB, replace the missing one with CA.

'''Escort fleet''': CL - 2 DD - 3 XX. XX could be any combination of more DD, up to 2 CA, 2 FBB, 3 CLT. (Or you can just use the same escort with the first 2 phase).

'''Route''': P-S-W. All surface battle with 2x BB on S.

'''LBAS''': unchanged from phase 2. All to boss.

'''Equipment''':
*BB: Standard setup with AP shell as wildcard.
*CVL: enough fighter for AS, then bomber on the rest.
*CL: surface setup with [[Star_Shell]].
*DD: Torp cut in.
*CA: Standard setup with [[Searchlight]] on one of them.
'''Estimated resource cost per run'''<span style="font-weight:normal;">: 192 fuel, 264 ammo, 100 baux on phase 2. 390 fuel, 588 ammo, 200 baux on phase 3. Plus any repair cost</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">and support expeditions.</span>
==Map 4 - Installation Raid==
'''Fleet''': 1/2 CAV - 3/4 CV - SS

'''Route''': A-B-C-E-H-I

B and E are air nodes. The rest are surface battle. Node C have a dangerous CVL.

'''LBAS''': full bomber on 2 bases, 3 fighter and [[Saiun]] on the third, set the third as air defense. 1 attack on node C and 3 on boss.

'''Equipment''':
*CAV: Gun-Gun-[[WG42_(Wurfgerät_42)]]-[[Type_3_Shell]]. If [[WG42_(Wurfgerät_42)]] is unavailable use a seaplane.
*CV: Enough fighter for AS at C, then load the remaining slots with torpedos bombers.
*SS: Torps-[[Emergency_Repair_Personnel]] There are no other place to use this anyway.
'''Estimated resource cost per run'''<span style="font-weight:normal;">: 325 fuel, 276 ammo, 400 baux. </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">Plus any repair cost</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">and support expeditions.</span>
