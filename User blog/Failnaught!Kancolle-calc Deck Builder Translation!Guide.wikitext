The Objective of this blog is to translate [http://kancolle-calc.net/deckbuilder.html Kancolle-calc Deck Builder]

Some Observations:
*I don't know Japanese, so this translation is all based on Google Translation and deduction, so use it at your discretion
*Red Text are those that are very likely correct
*Green Text are those that are probably correct, that is, i am not very confident on the translation as the red text
*I only translated what i could, some things i have no idea what it mean, if you know please comment it
*I haven't translated "LOS" and "Damage on Enemy" tabs because i think they aren't very important 
*if i made some mistake on the translations, please let me know
