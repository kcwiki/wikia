Choosing a spot to level my CVL did confused me a lot. So here I am trying to do an experiment with 3-2A.

I know. There are lot of things to consider when grinding at 3-2A. I just want your opinions about my experiment.

Fleet Composition:

'''CVL (Flagship), BBV, 3 DDs, and a Submarine.'''

Equipment:

'''CVL:'''
*Best Torpedo Bombers you have.
*Saiun placed on the last slot.
'''BBV:'''
*Smaller guns preferrably a 14cm Naval Gun and 15.2cm Naval Gun.
*A Zuiun or any Seaplane for Artillery Spotting.
*Radars (optional but recommended).
'''DDs:'''
*Equip them with at least a 12cm Naval Gun.
*Surface Radars may be optional but if you have one then please do equip it.
'''SS:'''
*Engine. If you don't have one then a torpedo tubes is fine.




Here's a sample video of my experiment:

There are still flaws that need to be detected and also need to be solve. If anyone has any ideas then please feel free to comment.
