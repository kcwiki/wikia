OK, so having seen a lot of salt in the last few days, I'm going to clear something up here.

Emoticons are fun, cute, and used sparingly, add a bit of fun to the live chat. That being said, you people both ask for and use WAY too many. I've already gone through and deleted most of the ones i've added for the simple reason that they're very situational, and because only a few people have asked for them. On top of them clogging up the chat and creating a big of a nuisance, they also take a little bit of effort to make and format for wikia usage. Therefore, I'm going to implement several changes.

I'm going to start being more liberal with my kicking from chat. Why? Emoticon spam. It blocks regular chat usage, and it's a headache for anyone trying to use the chat to talk normally.

Below, in the replies thread, post the emoticon YOU WANT TO KEEP, and if you support one, like it. After about a week, i'll go through and tally the votes and only keep the few that we use daily and the ones the community likes.

Last thing, for the duration of the event ill be diabling most if not all of the emoitcons. no exceptions. chat is going to be flooded with people reporting stuff and people asking for help during the event, and the alst thing i want to deal with is a bunch of people spamming falukorv or amagi.
