== The Story ==

Not much to say about this event. It was in my early days, so early in fact that I know almost nothing about events. (Less than a month after I joined to game to be exact) All I had in mind back then was to gather as many girls in existence as possible without any idea of how to level them up since I still didn't have any concept of level grinding.

The thing was I managed to constructed {{ShipBattleCardKai|Kumano}} out of my Kongou class BB (desperate) attempts (500/200/600/30 in case anyone needed to know). I knew that she was exceptionally rare, that was it. I had no idea how the heck did I get her or how to get anyone in her tier again. The thing was my OCD (and her cuteness) compelled me to find {{ShipBattleCardKai|Suzuya}} ASAP. I knew spamming BB formula hoping for her is a stupid idea so I asked the wikia community of what to do. Someone told me to try spamming E-1, so I gave it a shot. Before I set off, I found out that {{ShipBattleCardKai|Ooyodo}} also dropped there. Seeing that she both herself and her [[File:Fleet_Command_Facility_107_Card.png|30px]] would be useful in the long term, I also added her to the main goal, and that was it. I intended and did stay only at E-1.

Thinking back, I should've been braver that I was, otherwise I would've got Katsuragi by now. My salt tolerance wasn't so high back then, so I didn't have the gut to try E-2, but now, I'm quite confident that even back then, my fleet could do E-2.


<strong style="color:rgb(231,76,60);font-size:20px;">Main Farming Goals</strong>

{{ShipBattleCardKai|Suzuya}} X 2

{{ShipBattleCardKai|Kumano}}

{{ShipBattleCardKai|Ooyodo}}

Note: I got 2nd Kumano during Ooyodo farming attempt after I got Suzuya, so I set the rule that if second Suzuya come before Ooyodo, the second Kumano would got to stay, and she really did, so I got 2 copies of each after event.

Note: I didn't have idea of making any record back then, so these are purely from my screenshots.
