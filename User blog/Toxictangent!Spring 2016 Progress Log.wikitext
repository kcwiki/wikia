==Prior to the Event==
May 1st:

The event starts tomorrow. I do not have high expectations for my fleet, as I have done very little between the end of Winter 2016 and now. I would be disappointed in myself, but honestly final exams are literally tomorrow and I have been sinking in time where it counts. Hopefully. My fleet is pretty much similar to where I was at when Winter 2016 finished. I was slightly disappointed that I wasn't able to get Ooyodo to Kai for her FCF, but who knows- maybe extensive usage of her in this event will be all I need.

Thankfully, with my low expectations for this event, I have no qualms going medium or easy for the first 2 maps. I heard it's going to be 'Total War' with intense shiplocking, so I am also a bit nervous. Nevertheless, I'll place some faith in the shipgirls that have helped me through the past 2 events.

Apparently, the ideal day to start event operations is on the 3rd day. I will see if that makes any difference to going in on the second day!
