Hello everyone,

Actually, I'm working on a .ods file with all stats of all class-ship.

It's Based on this kind of model :

[[File:Table_class_KC.png|thumb|left|260px|Mutsuki-Class for exemple.]]

:::: Actually Include :

- All stats including Speed & Range, and Consumption (ammo & fuel),

- Averages per ship class & ship categories,

- Difference betwenn Base and Maxed,

- Prevent when upgrade use Blue Print (B) or Catalult (PDC),

- All basics stats of each class,

- All of this of each type ship (DD, CL, CA, BB...),

- Include unbuildable ships class.

<p style="margin-left: 96px;"></p>





Will include :

- Same for all class Upgrade, (Kai, Kai Ni, Kai Ni A / B, Class type change (taigei)...)

- Ordering each class per stats (crescent and descendant)



Actually, it's just made for compare easily stats between ships and class, taking care a lot of things.

But things can update. (Like puting priority coefficient...)
