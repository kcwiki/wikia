7/21... finally reached 4-2 boss with the specified fleet to complete one of the quests when my Kaga finally reached level 99 at the same time! >w< omedetou Kaga-san~ To me, at this point, Kaga is more like a mature woman to be admired rather than someone to fall in love with, but who knows when that will change, haha (took 5 or 6 tries to reach boss, fleet was strong enough so no worry about not clearing at all, but that's more res than I wanted to use for this one quest)
