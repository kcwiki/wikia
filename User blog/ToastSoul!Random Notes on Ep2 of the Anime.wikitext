Contains various comments on episode two of the Kantai Collection anime. Includes comments on animation errors and continuity but is largely me over thinking anime logic. I didn't want to flood the wiki with random pictures so it's uploaded to Google Drive [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-7IRQQVJE1meDMzaU5TZFRhZ3M/view?usp=sharing here].

Please do look at it if you're bored or interested and don't have OCD because the images aren't all scaled to the same size.
