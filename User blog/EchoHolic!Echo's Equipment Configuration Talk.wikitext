==Introductions==
Rather than introductions, I'd actually like to explain this blog post. It's not only a self reference for equipment, but I've seen newer players and some who've been playing for awhile having various misunderstandings about combat, equipement, and various other mechanics about the game. Usually my reaction is to link newer players to the [[Combat]] page, but as KanColle develops, increasing amounts of new mechanics and types of equipment emerge every few months, sometimes obsoleting information we once knew, and not everyone does keep up with these developments.

The intricate mechanics of KanColle is highly fascinating but also confusing to people who do not keep up or have read several conflicting first-hand reports on mechanics within the game. I'd like to present a simple referral page for people to hopefully find useful when trying to figure out what to equip on their girls.

'''The goal of this page is to present the following:'''
*Simple referencable equipment loadouts for each of the normal maps, as well as Extra Operations. (eg. x-5 maps)
*A listing of several of what I think is the best optimal configs for each type of ship.
*Listing of several pieces of the more unique released equipment and my opinions on it's functions.
*Explanations of several game mechanics as simple as possible and what it means for you and your ships.



==Ship Loadouts==

'''Note:''' Newer admirals might not have the recommended equipment listed, but it's perfectly ok as long as you use equipment that have the '''same icon''', the only exception being [[Type A Ko-hyoteki]].

|-
!colspan="5"|Explanation
|-
|style="text-align: center;" colspan="5"|For destroyers like [[Yuudachi]] and [[Ayanami]], whose firepower is particularly high, a double gun setup is highly recommended. Even for normal destroyers, if the map does not require anything special such as ASW, the double gun setup can be considered to give them a double attack at night, as the chances of a double attack activating is much higher than cut-in attacks for destroyers without exceptionally high luck.

|-
!style="width:30%;" colspan="5"|Explanation
|-
|style="text-align: center;" colspan="5"|This setup is meant for destroyers with high luck, capable of enacting cut-in attacks often enough to be outfitted for it. Either a surface RADAR or a searchlight is recommended, to increase torpedo accuracy and increase cut-in chance respectively. In the case where you own neither a searchlight or RADAR, a third torpedo may be fitted.

|-
!style="width:30%;" colspan="5"|Explanation
|-
|style="text-align: center;" colspan="5"|Often when you have to take destroyers for routing purposes, especially in World 4, there's bound to be a submarine node in the midst of the map. Outfitting a destroyer with ASW equipment greatly increases it's ability to kill them, due to how the ASW stat works. The combination of a Sonar and Depth Charge (Increases ASW damage by 20%) is usually enough to kill most subs, so you can change out one of the SONARS for a Boiler for extra survivability.

|-
!style="width:30%;" colspan="5"|Explanation
|-
|style="text-align: center;" colspan="5"|With the introduction of the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|Air Directors]] and AA Cut-in mechanic, Destroyers now have the ability to shoot down large amounts of planes with the correct setup. As long has you have a Green gun, Air Director (or the 10cm+Director combo equip), with an Air RADAR, there's a chance of shooting down an increased number of planes based off AA stat. Highly useful in maps which have nodes of enemies with 2-3 Aircraft Carriers, greatly reducing the chance of taking damage in the Air Battle phase.
