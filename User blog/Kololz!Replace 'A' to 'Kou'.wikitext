<p>With the new introduction of Shoukaku Kai Ni, which comes along with Shoukaku Kai Ni A/Kou, it seems there is a need to unifiy a call for the word "甲" or even "乙", "丙", as there might be more similar names coming in future updates.</p>Currently we're using both A/B/C and Kou/Otsu/Hei, as shown in the [[Shoukaku]] page and the [[Chitose]]/[[Chiyoda]] page, and the latter one in the&nbsp;[[Kouhyouteki]] page.
So it comes the problem like the past issue "Use Kai 2 or Kai Ni?", which ended up using Kai Ni.

Right now, some people love calling Kou/Otsu/Hei instead of A/B/C in comment or chats, would it be better to use Kou/Otsu/Hei?

How do you think? Should we use A/B/C or Kou/Otsu/Hei?

On the other hand, you might have noticed event also use the words 甲,乙,丙, but this topic is not talking about events, so I am not discussing to replace "Hard" to "Kou" or "Easy" to "Hei". This topic is talking about the ship naming after all.
