I swear...they are hinting the Kai ni of Yura or something. I got her so many times I lost count. She's not rare, yes, but I got at least 5 of her from every map.

Note: The 3rd appetizer or so I thought. The map seems too bland and easy that it'll work better as the 2nd appetizer than the 3rd. 2 Failed runs, 1 was due to closing the tab and another one because I thought FCF was supposed to be on the FS of the 2nd fleet instead of 1st.<br />
Other than that...how E-4 went for all clear run:<br />

[[File:Kirishima kai2 card.jpg]] - Nothing passes her without sinking. She didn't miss any shot and managed to sink the boss during day battle twice.

Notable Mention

[[File:Shigure kai2 card.jpg]] & [[File:Yuudachi kai2 card.jpg]] - I put WG42 on them for the lulz, but it turns out they managed to chip off the boss hp more than I thought. Once, Yuudachi did 134 damages on the boss alone during day battle.

Note: If I am to describe an obstacle that seems passable yet unexpectedly annoying and pain-staking then I will definitely describe my experience with this map. Hate the map, love the boss and the beautiful BGM. It's like eating all those three soft appetizers then the chef gave you a spice heavy Indian dish as your first main dish.

}}

Note: I have mixed feelings with this map...but more toward the "Oh god, not again" feeling. Seeing My Love again is both good and bad at the same time (mostly bad). The good is I get to payback her love from last time. The bad is...she gives me even more.<br />This is the main dish I've been waiting for yet wasn't as extraordinary as last time. However, it still lives up to my taste even though many said it's easy.

<p style="text-align:center;">''' Dear you - An ode to my Love '''</p>

Last event, I was so sure the nightmare was over. That I will never face it again. Yet here she is, back to see me for another dance at the last stage of the event where she will show me pain.

Her white long hair fluttering in the wind ; her side-ponytail that gives her a kiddish feeling; her body, which captivates anyone who sees her; her hands, pointing toward the object she wishes to destroy...me; those takoyakis...that dampened the light of hope everytime it flew across the screen.

It is a tough love girl; I hope this will go well. I am ready to dance with you again CV Hime; for tonight, we'll dine in hell.

<p style="text-align:center;">'''''' The Last Dance ''''' It'll never work out between us darling~ [[File:Holyshit.png|400px]] [[File:E6_Clear_H2shimo_Finisher.png|400px]]</p>

Goddess Haruna has descended onto the battlefield to bless me with her glory. Great performance during day battle and magnificent performance during night battle she excels over everyone this event. Her achievements included: E-2, boss finisher majority of the time during day battle; E-5, survivor most of the time against the odds of E-5; E-6, she wrecked CV Hime enough to pull her down below chuuha, allowing us to past the pre-boss node before meeting her at the boss node and did the same thing again. Haruna is blessed with love this event compared to the last one. This time, she can really say she's daijobu.

'''''Kongou'''''
</center>
<p style="text-align:center;">[[File:Kongou kai2 card.jpg]] <br />Kongou Took-a-Level-in-Badass this event. From her extremely poor performance during Winter 2015 to the point that I almost scrap her; she became a beast in this event; rarely get hit and almost always destroy non-boss ships. In E-5, when she's the only ship left during night battle and the boss has 286 hp left, she didn't disappoint me and sink the boss and clearing the map. As for her payback toward CV Hime, she was able to dodge every single hit CV Hime sends to her while attacking back. Fusou kinda took the curse instead.<br /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">'''''Ooi and Kitakami'''''</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">[[File:Ooi kai2 card.jpg]] & [[File:Kitakami kai2 card.jpg]] <br />They are the Krillin and Goku team. One needs to get hurt before the other becomes a beast. This happens so many times I thought it's their thing or something. For example, one time KTKM got taiha'd by the E-6 boss and we proceed to night battle with 5 ships left on the boss side; Ooi ignores all of them and went for the boss...double-tap her to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">'''''Kaga-san'''''</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">[[File:Kaga kai card.jpg]] -<br />She's the ace in the shadow. If I am to give a 2nd place for the MVP of the event then it is definitely her. The 46 plane slots saved me from many troubles during the event. Her ability to dodge almost everything for no reason makes her the best tank. Her participation on E-6 (although ended with her being Reppuu mule) was magnificent. The map could not be done without her as she tanked 2 hits from CV Hime in pre-boss node, 1 more hit from her in boss node and another hit from BB Oni without flinching. While Haruna holds the front line, she's at the back, supporting everyone. Overall, she deserves her own mini-picture (go take a well earned rest with all your sisters):<br /></p>

==End Note==

It's first event that I felt like I cleared the whole thing and not half-ass-ing like last one. It feels good, but from what everyone said, the event isn't that hard. So I shall wait for the hard one to come; to prove to myself that I can overcome any obstacle this game throws at me. The next time Devs starts tweeting something along the line of "CAN YOU DIG IT....SUCKAAAA!", I will be saying "Yes...".
