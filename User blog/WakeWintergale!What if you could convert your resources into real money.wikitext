So then one day I was browsing through Akashi’s shop hoping to buy some slots as I brought a wallet that only had a Tanaka-brand salt sachet inside. (;-;).

And before leaving, I found something that hopefully NOBODY has ever thought about buying with DMM points…'''“100 pieces of bauxite = 100 DMM points”'''

So, meaning...

'''<u>1 DMM point</u> = <span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span><u><span style="font-weight:normal;">¥</span>1</u>''', yeah?

Then that made me wonder... what if I could '''exchange that bauxite for''' '''REAL MONEY''' instead? (which is impossible DUH) ''':/'''
Soon after that, I immediately grabbed a calculator and started crunching on those numbers.







So then let’s say that I reached the hard-cap of 300K bauxite and turned it all into cash. And what came out was:
*'''300K bauxite = <u>¥300,000.00</u> OR <u>$2707.00</u>'''

'''BUT, that’s not the end of it!''' I told myself why include '''Fuel, Ammo, Steel and Buckets''' into the mix eh? (Heck I could have even considered Devmats and Instant Constructions, but I’ll leave that to some other genius out there to find out by themselves.)

Well then, now it's just a matter of finding the ratio of every resource other than bauxite and blah, blah add them all together and etc... hopefully you get the idea cuz I personally dislike all that detailed stuff. xd

Soo... For some of you fellows, I'll spare you guys the math and give you guys the answer... (Unless you can look away now and try to calculate by yourselves, and damn it's actually simpler than you think)

'''Bauxite''' - 300K(<span style="font-weight:normal;">¥100</span> / 100pcs) = '''<u>¥300,000.00</u> OR <u>$2707.00</u>'''

*'''Fuel '''- 300K(<span style="font-weight:normal;">¥100 </span>/ 200pcs ) = '''<u>¥150,000.00</u> OR <u>$1352.05</u>'''

*'''Ammo '''- 300K(<span style="font-weight:normal;">¥100 </span>/ 200pcs ) = '''<u>¥150,000.00</u> OR <u>$1352.05</u>'''

*'''Steel '''- 300K(<span style="font-weight:normal;">¥100</span> / 150pcs ) = '''<u>¥200,000.00</u> OR <u>$1802.73</u>'''

*'''Buckets '''- 3K(<span style="font-weight:normal;">¥300</span> / 5pcs ) = '''<u>¥180,000.00</u> OR <u>$1622.46</u>'''
'''then just add em all up...'''



And in total, if you can manage to save and add up all this much RSC up to the hard-cap, then you can ''theoratically ''recieve a shocking amount of (at least in my perspective)...

<p style="text-align:center;">'''<u>¥980,000.00</u>!'''</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">OR</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">'''<u>$8,836.29</u>!'''</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">'''WTF that's almost worth half a million from where I live! xd'''</p>

Lolz anyways, I dunno how in the hell did I even get this far in making this cuz I absolutely hate Math. :/

But hey, at least a TTK can at least imagine that he/she spent all that time doing sparkled expedition runs and Orel Cruising just to save up that much money eh?
