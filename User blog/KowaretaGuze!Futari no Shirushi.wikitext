We turn our heads to that direction
<br/>After this everything will change
<br/>No matter what the time we'll go together right?
<br/>The bonds between the two of us
<br/>
<br/>Fighting every day while doing
<br/>Practices and expeditions
<br/>We're fine at anytime
<br/>To eastward we shall go
<br/>
<br/>I make mistakes here and there
<br/>It's kind of depressing but
<br/>That feeling will pass away
<br/>And then I'll be fine tomorrow
<br/>
<br/>We might not be a match for the
<br/>Battleships or carriers
<br/>
<br/>We'll show you our true power
<br/>
<br/>We're not getting full of ourselves!
<br/>
<br/>I will always be close to you
<br/>I will be there for you at anytime
<br/>
<br/>Our connected hearts echoes a melody
<br/>Dawn now shines on the sky
<br/>
<br/>We turn our heads to that direction
<br/>After this everything will change
<br/>No matter what the time we'll go together
<br/>
<br/>Holding each others hands, off we go
<br/>
<br/>The symbol between the two of us
<br/>
<br/>I feel like I'm a little bit weak
<br/>Which causes all these blunders
<br/>I can't simply ignore this
<br/>For my beloved little sister
<br/>
<br/>I'll be there at anytime
<br/>To support everyone
<br/>Even a child like me could be
<br/>A gentle older sister
<br/>
<br/>These memories of today
<br/>I won't forget them
<br/>
<br/>I'll keep on finding new things today
<br/>
<br/>We won't leave each others side!
<br/>
<br/>It feels like this small chest of mine
<br/>Is slowly getting bigger and bigger
<br/>I'm sure, without a doubt we'll be able to reach them
<br/>
<br/>As long as we have each others backs
<br/>
<br/>As a new day begins to rise
<br/>Our bonds will still stay strong
<br/>
<br/>I wish that these days
<br/>May continue on
<br/>
<br/>It would be nice for it to last
<br/>These harmonious days
<br/>
<br/>After crying out those tears
<br/>A rainbow will shine
<br/>
<br/>No matter how painful it is
<br/>It will all be blown away
<br/>
<br/>I will always be close to you
<br/>I will be there for you at anytime
<br/>
<br/>Our connected hearts echoes a melody
<br/>Dawn now shines on the sky
<br/>
<br/>We turn our heads to that direction
<br/>After this everything will change
<br/>No matter what the time we'll go together
<br/>
<br/>We'll do it all the way
<br/>And paint the peaceful future
