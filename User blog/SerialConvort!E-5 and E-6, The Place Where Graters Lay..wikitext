<p style="text-align:center;">E5: Imagine this, you walk into a bar, you order a Root Beer, Â in response you get slapped with a piano. That is my whole experience of E5. Im serious.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">E6: I really dont know how to explain E6, other than the major depression, salt, and the mental breaking of my mind and soul. I died around 6 times over the whole E6, and all of those deaths mentally broke me. Only after many desperate attempts, I finally beat E6 with a hand held high, and got the Hard Clear Medal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">After all that effort, I finally finish the event with head held high, and near the end of the event I lost my sanity two fold in the depths of hell known as E7. The farm for Roma was a hard and lingering battle between me and the K Node and Boss Node. In the end, only dissapointment met me and my ships. We failed. We failed yet we gave it our all. In the end even all the hard work, determination, and unreal grinding of all resources I could express. We lost. I lost. Sayonara, Roma.</p>
