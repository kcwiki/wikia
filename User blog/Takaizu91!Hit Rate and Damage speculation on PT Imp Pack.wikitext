==Hit Rate and Damage Speculation on PT Imp and alike==


This blog is intended to house a speculation on whether a few equipments and/or setup can increase hit rate to an extremely mobile [[PT_Imp_Pack|PT Imp Pack]]. I'm currently doing this on my free time and I may or may not update this blog on time.

''I have little knowledge on keeping this blog with better layout/edit so anyone can give me advice on how to improve this like giving visuals of equipment when highlighted and so on. Help is appreciated.''
