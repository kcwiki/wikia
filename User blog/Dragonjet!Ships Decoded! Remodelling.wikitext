This post previously contained a table of remodel data for all ships. It had columns for level requirements, fuel and ammo costs for both base and kai forms who had kai ni.

I now discarded the table, in favor of the official [[Remodel]] page adopted by [[User:Hystericallify|Hystericallify]]. I will also contribute to that page when needed.

My source is the API game data so my numbers are accurate.

If you wish to see the old table, here is a wiki history link:
