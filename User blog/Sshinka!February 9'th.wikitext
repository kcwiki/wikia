February 28'th - Altho i had extreamly little time for farming the event, i somehow managed to get Asagumo and Amagi. That means there are only two Girls i need to finish the Kandex. Those are Yamato and Musashi. I'm under alot of pressure IRL, and probably gonna play Kancolle less in the future (damn, i wish the developers add automatic expeditions rotation for us that don't have all the time in the world to attend computer non stop just to keep refreshing mission no2)

February 9'th - I gathered 1377 buckets, 287K Ammo and Fuel, 300K Steel, and 67K Bauxite for the Spring Event 2016.
Married Taihou today. Having 16 Waifu now.
