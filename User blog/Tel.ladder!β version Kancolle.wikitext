[[File:Kancolle_β.jpg|thumb|left]]

<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Yesterday, thanks to Dragonjet's blog post, I noticed the existence of master ship record, and the record reminded me of information about β version Kancolle (the photo on the left).</span>

I got this from a personal website and never know if it is certain (it may be a well made photocollage for mischief). But, compared with the record, it didn't seem to be strange very much, so I decided to add this photo.

On the photo, there are some stats that can't be seen today and that remain in the record. And it seems that there is a correspondance below.

After reading those, I get to wonder how dexterity is determined.

砲回避 and 雷回避 seem to be integrated into a new stat, evasion and it is actually indicated in stat window. But I can't find out accuracy's counterpart.

Perhaps, any 命中+ may be meaningless…
