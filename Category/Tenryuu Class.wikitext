The Tenryū-class cruisers (天龍型軽巡洋艦) where the first light cruisers operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy, where they are designed to act as flagships for destroyer flotillas. The design represented an intermediate class between the light cruiser and the destroyer (thus calling them as torpedo division). They are also the first ships in the Japanese navy to be armed with [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/61cm_Triple_Torpedo_Mount triple torpedo tubes].
