The Zara-class was an Italian heavy cruiser design of the Regia Marina from the early 1930s. Unlike the earlier ''Trento''-class, designed around firepower and speed at the expense of armor, these ships were built with heavy protection in mind, turning out to be the best protected heavy cruisers of their age. However, this result could be obtained only by ignoring the limits set by the Washington Naval Treaty.
