An '''autogyro''' (from Greek αὐτός and γύρος, "self-turning"), also known as a ''gyroplane'' or ''gyrocopter'', is a type of rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in free autorotation to develop lift. Forward thrust is provided independently, typically by an engine-driven propeller. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing across the rotor disc to generate rotation, and the air flows upwards through the rotor disc rather than down.
