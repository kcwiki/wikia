The Yūgumo-class destroyer (夕雲型駆逐艦) also called Destroyer Type-A by IJN from their plan name. They were similar to the preceding Kagerō-class with the only difference were a slightly different bridge design and the introduction of a new type of turrets for the main guns which were capable of 75-degree elevations giving better AA capabilities.

During the Pacific War the Yūgumo-class served in the IJN's 2nd, 10th, 31st and 32nd Destroyer Divisions.
