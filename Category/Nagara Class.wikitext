The Nagara-class light cruiser (長良型軽巡洋艦) which is design almost similar to the Kuma-class with minor changes in design, primarily due to advances in torpedo technology which initially designated as “modified Kuma-class”, or “5500-ton class Type II” before being re-designated after the lead vessel, [[Nagara]]. Before the re-designation already 3 ships existed, reason why their appearance is different.

After the start of the war, each of the vessels in the Nagara-class was modified and upgraded, especially to enhance anti-aircraft capabilities, but no two vessels were modified in the same way. By the year 1943-1944, the five surviving ships in the class received radar.
