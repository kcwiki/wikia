The Furutaka-class cruisers (古鷹型巡洋艦) were the first heavy cruisers in the IJN and also referred to as “A class” cruisers. Like the [[Yuubari|Yūbari]], their design was the work of Constructor Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, assisted by Lt. Cmdr. Fujimoto Kikuo.

Designed to beat the USN Omaha-class cruisers and the British Hawkins-class cruisers, they were as fast as the Omaha-classs (and nearly 4 knots faster than the Hawkins-class), while firing a heavier broadside, and carrying a larger torpedo battery than either one.

They were the first of the I.J.N. cruisers to feature a substantial bridge, with 6 distinct levels, providing support for navigation, fire control, communication and command.
