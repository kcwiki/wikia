The Imperial Russian Navy (Russian: Российский императорский флот) was the navy of the Russian Empire. It was formally established in 1696 and lasted until being disrupted during the February Revolution of 1917. It developed from a smaller force that had existed prior to Peter the Great's founding the regular Russian Navy during the Second Azov campaign. It was expanded in the second half of the 18th century and by the early part of the 19th century, it reached its peak strength, behind only the British and French fleets in terms of size.
