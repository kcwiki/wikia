The Shiratsuyu-class destroyer (白露型駆逐艦) were modified versions of the Hatsuharu-class Destroyer, in the light of the Tomozuru incident. While the leading ship along her other 5 sister-ships, was built under the "Circle One Program", the additional four vessels were ordered under the ”Circle-Two Naval Expansion Plan", and all vessels were completed by 1937.

Shiratsuyu-class destroyers were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the USN during the Pacific War, also they were the first Japanese warships to be completed with quadruple torpedo mounts and telephone communications to the torpedo station. As with the Hatsuharu-class, the torpedo launchers were given a protective shield to allow for use in heavy weather and to protect against splinter damage.
