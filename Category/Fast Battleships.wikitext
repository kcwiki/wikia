A fast battleship was a battleship which emphasized speed without — in concept — undue compromise of either armor or armament.  Because most of the early WWI-era dreadnought battleships were typically built with low design speeds, so the term "fast battleship" is applied to a design which was considerably faster. The extra speed of a fast battleship was normally required to allow the vessel to carry out additional roles besides taking part in the line of battle, such as escorting aircraft carriers.

In Kantai Collection, they are Battleships listed with "fast" in their speed. Which had no significant effect during a battle except in some maps where speed is based for routing.
