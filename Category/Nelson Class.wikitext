The only British battleships built by Britain between WW1 and 2, they were essentially a cut-down compromise design of the planned N3 battleships due to the Washington naval treaty. They were the only British ships to mount 16" guns, using the unusual designs of all three gun turrets placed aft, and focused on armour over speed. The two ships, ''Nelson'' and ''Rodney'' saw heavy service through the war, taking part in many convoys and bombardments but were handicapped by their slow speed, with only ''Rodney'' seeing action against an enemy ship (''Bismarck''). At the war's end they were judged too slow and expensive to modernise and were sold for scrap.
