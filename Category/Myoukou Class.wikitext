Myōkō-class cruisers (妙高型巡洋艦 Myōkō-gata jun'yōkan) is a heavy cruiser class that were built for the Imperial Japanese Navy in the late 1920s.

At the time, this was the heaviest armament of any cruiser class in the world. They were also the first cruisers the Japanese Navy constructed that exceeded the (10,000 ton) limit set by the Washington Naval Treaty.
