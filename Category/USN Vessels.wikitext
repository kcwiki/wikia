The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the largest naval forces in the world. While they participated in the Atlantic Theater, such as Operation Torch, the Sicily, Italy, and the Normandy landings alongside the other Allied forces, they were more famously known for their actions in the Pacific Theater, where they fought every major battle and eventually essentially wiped out the Japanese Navy.
