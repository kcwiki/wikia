The Maestrale class were a group of four destroyers built for the Italian Navy and that served in World War II. They were an enlarged and improved version of the Dardo-class destroyers; they were 10 meters (33 ft) longer and introduced new pattern 120 mm guns. Their success made them the basis for all the subsequent destroyer classes of the Regia Marina up to World War II.
