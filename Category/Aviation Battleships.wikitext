The Aviation Battleship (航空戦艦 / こうくうせんかん , ''Kōkū senkan'') is the hybridization of a Battleship and it's guns, with the Carrier and air support, ideally combining the best of both.

The only full conversion and operational service for Aviation Battleships were the IJN Ise and Hyuuga, converted after the Battle of Midway to compensate for the loss of carriers. However they were never allocated planes rendering the conversion pointless, and the loss of firepower due to the landing deck was a serious weakness given the ferocity of US air strikes at the war's end.

The first attempt at combining the two was HMS Furious during WW1, however she was soon converted to a full carrier as the short landing deck was impractical. It was also considered during WW2 to convert the in production Lion Class Battleships to carrier hyrbids, however the idea was rejected, with the Naval Gunnery Director refering to the idea as "these abortions are the results of a psychological maladjustment".
