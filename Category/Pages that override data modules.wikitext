This category contains pages that use the ''override'' feature of the new Lua module-backed templates. 

This category should be as empty as possible; any valid overrides should be merged into the backing data module itself. [[Module:ShipInfoKai]] will always be in this category due to a problem with Wikia's implementation of Scribunto; it can be ignored.
