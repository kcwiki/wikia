The Fusou-class battleships (扶桑型戦艦) were built by the IJN during World War I, in which they both patrol briefly off the coast of China before being placed in reserve at the war's end.

During the 1930s, both ships underwent a series of modernizations and reconstructions. The modernization increased their armor, replaced and upgraded their machinery, and rebuilt their superstructures into the distinctive pagoda mast style. Despite the expensive reconstructions, both vessels were considered obsolescent by the eve of World War II, and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war.
