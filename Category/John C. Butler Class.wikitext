The '''John C. Butler class''' were destroyer escorts that served during World War II. The class was also known as the WGT type from their Westinghouse Geared turbine drive.
Of the 293 ships originally planned, 206 were canceled in 1944 and a further four after being laid down; three were not completed until after the end of World War II.
