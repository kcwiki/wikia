Armored aircraft carriers (装母) only possesses four representatives: Taihou, Shoukaku, Zuikaku, and Saratoga (the latter 3 in Kai Ni A form).  

Armored carriers are very similar to other standard carriers with the exceptions of having increased armor and being able to launch planes during the shelling phase even at moderate damage.
