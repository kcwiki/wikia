The Kaidai Type VI also called the I-168 class were built under the Maru 1 Programme and the Maru 2 Programme. They are faster than their predecessors, these boats had the highest surface speed of any submarines in the world in the mid-1930s, although their speed was surpassed slightly by later IJN submarines. 

The Kaidai VI's contributed to the sinking of two USN aircraft carriers during World War II.
