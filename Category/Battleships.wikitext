A Battleship (戦艦 / せんかん , ''Senkan'') is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of heavy caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the battleship was the most powerful type of warship and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea.

In spite of the immense resources spent on battleships, there were few pitched battleship clashes. Even with their enormous firepower and protection, battleships were increasingly vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper weapons: initially the torpedo and the naval mine and later, the aircraft and the guided missile.
