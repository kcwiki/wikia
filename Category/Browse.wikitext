This is our top-level category; looking at it another way, it is the root category.

Ideally, every other category should be a subcategory of at least one other, and every article should be in at least one category; many will fit well into two or more (e.g. location, year, and subject-matter).

The "Content" category is intended for all articles about the subject matter of the wiki, whilst "Organisation" is intended for all administrative matters. A full list of existing categories can be found at [[Special:Categories]].

To add a new category to a page, just add <code><nowiki>[[Category:Categoryname]]</nowiki></code> to the end of the article or existing category page.
