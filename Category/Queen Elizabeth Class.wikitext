Generally consistered the first fast battleships, and the first battleships to mount 15cm guns, the five ships of the Queen Elizabeth led a long and eventful service history. Proving their design at Jutland they showed that they were tougher and more accurate than anything before. By the time of WW2 they were somewhat dated to various degrees, with Queen Elizabeth, Valiant and Warspite being modernised, and Barham and Malaya almost unchanged - though they were slow by modern battleship standards. All saw heavy service during the war in all theatres and only Barham being lost.
