We will classify these enemies under , '<nowiki/>'''Demon (鬼 Oni-type）'''<nowiki/>', '<nowiki/>'''Princess (姫 Hime-type）'''<nowiki/>', ’'''War Demon（戦鬼 Senki-type）'''<nowiki/>', '<nowiki/>'''War Princess（戦姫 Senki-type）'''<nowiki/>', ''''Water Demon(水鬼 Suiki-type）'''<nowiki/>', ''''Water Princess(水姫 Suiki-type）'''<nowiki/>' and ''''Abyssal Princess(深海～姫 Shinkai-Hime-type）'''<nowiki/>' seven ranks as of January, 2019. In addition, summarize conveniently the other non Iroha Abyssal enemies here. Generally, it is appeared for the first time, their ability is higher than Abyssals which name gets [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha Iroha] and they can speak human words (there is the exception). In Japanese, these Kanjis seems to be read with '''ki''' '''(鬼), ki (姫), senki (戦鬼), senki (戦姫), suiki (水鬼,水姫), shinkai (深海）''' and it seems that Kancolle use this way of reading.

Generally, Princesses are stronger than Demons. War Princesses are stronger than War Demons too, but there being only one kind each a connection with Demons and Princesses is missing. The strongest class in the species, Water Demons and 
Water Princesses have the ability which exceeds in Princesses. Abyssal Princesses have dreadful power and they often form combined fleets. But they have specific weak point which comes from historical war.
