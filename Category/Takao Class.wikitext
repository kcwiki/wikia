The Takao-class (高雄型) was launched in the early 1930s as some of the heaviest-armed cruisers in the world, having more barrels than her contemporaries elsewhere in the world while also uniquely equipped with torpedo tubes for additional punch.

They were an evolution from the preceding ''Myoko''-class, with heavier torpedo armamanent and had an almost battleship-like, large bridge structure.Their main gun armament was ten [[20.3cm Twin Gun Mount|20 cm (8 in)]] guns in twin mounts and they were also armed with sixteen [[61cm Quad Torpedo Mount|24 inch Long Lance torpedoes]](carrying more than the ''Myokos'' or ''Mogamis''), making the ''Takaos'' the most heavily armed cruisers of the IJN. The only flaw was that they were considered top-heavy and thus prone to capsizing, while Turret #3 had a poor firing arc. These two problems were rectified in the follow-up ''Mogamis''; nonetheless the ''Takaos'' were considered the best cruisers that the IJN ever built.
