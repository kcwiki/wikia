An '''armor-piercing shell''', ('''AP''' for short) is a type of ammunition designed to penetrate armor. From the 1860s to 1950s, a major application of armor-piercing projectiles was to defeat the thick armor carried on many warships. The classic AP shell is now seldom used in naval warfare, as modern warships have little or no armor protection.
