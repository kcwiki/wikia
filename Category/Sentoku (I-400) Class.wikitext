The I-400-class "Sen Toku" Submarines were the largest submarines of World War II and remained the largest ever built until the construction of nuclear ballistic missile submarines in the 1960s.

They were designed specifically to serve as submarine carriers with the capacity to carry up to three aircraft while still maintaining the typical submarine function as a torpedo launching vessel. The original purpose of these submarines were to carry attack aircraft to destroy the Panama Canal. Also they were designed with the range to travel anywhere in the world and return.
