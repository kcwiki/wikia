'''For a full list of help pages, see [[Help:Contents]],''' which includes non-local help pages, automatically transcluded from [[w:c:help|Wikia Help]].


===About this category===
This category is intended to contain all the '''local''' "help" pages for this Wikia: pages that can help contributors and/or readers. If you find helpful pages that you think should be here, you may include them here just by typing <nowiki>[[Category:Help]]</nowiki> on them.

Most, but not all, have "Help:" at the beginning of their page names and are therefore in the "Help" namespace; an automatically-generated list of those can be found at [[Special:AllPages]] by running down the "Namespace" menu.


===Getting more help===
You can also:
* Ask questions at the local [[Forum:Index|forum]].
* Talk to one of the [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|site administrators]] or any currently active contributor (the people whose names appear on [[Special:RecentChanges|the "Recent changes" page]]); use their user talk pages.
* If you can't find what you need on this wiki, you can seek help at the [[w:|Central Wikia]], especially at the [[w:Forum:Index|Central forum]].  

If you still need help, you may want to contact the [[w:Community Team|Wikia Community Team]].
