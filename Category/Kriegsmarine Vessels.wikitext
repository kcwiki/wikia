List of the Kriegsmarine (War Navy) Kanmusu that make appearance in KanColle.

It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire and the inter-war Reichsmarine. The Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s (the Treaty of Versailles had limited the size of the German navy previously, and prohibited building of submarines). 

In January 1939 Plan Z was ordered, calling for naval parity with the Royal Navy by 1944. However, when World War II broke out in September 1939, Plan Z was shelved in favour of building submarines (U-boats) and prioritizing land and air forces.
