== General Information ==
* Name : 朝日
* Server : Hashirajima Anchorage
* HQ Level : 104
* Playing since June 2015

== Fleet Girls Status ==
* Samidare (First Ship), currently on expedition duty. I hope you don't mind Samidare--sorry for abandoning you for a while. ''(Don't overwork yourself, Admiral.)''

* Shoukaku is doing fine with Kaga, but Akagi and Zuikaku, well... let's just said that I didn't really focus on air power... ''(Don't put me with that 5th CarDiv turkey) (What did you just said, huh!?)''

* Yamato GET! You'll be out on sortie often (hopefully), so don't worry about being a ho--What? I'm not allowed to say that? ''(I, Yamato, won't let you call her that, Admiral!)''

* Bismarck and Taihou--is not here! Even Katori and Musashi is not here even though I have Yamato! What's wrong with you, RNG--wait, I don't even do LSC in the first place...

* The expedition fleet is very busy... Thank you for your hard work, girls! ''(I want some holiday, nyaa~) (Is this expedition duty permanent, Commander? You haven't change the formation for a while...)''
* I LOVE HATSUKAZE, so I won't grind her for level and just let it happens naturally, yeah! Wait for me, level 99! ''(Are you dumb? I'm going to Myoukou-neesan...)''

== Resource Status ==
* {{Bauxite}} BAUXITE SHORTAGE! {{Fuel}}FUEL SHORTAGE! I need to do more overnight expedition, but I always fell asleep before sending them...
* Trying to save at least 180k+ resource for next event but I'm so lazy to play and do expedition every time.
