|Semi-active projects
|
*Voice
**[[Template:Shiphourly]] doesn't require audio arguments anymore, new pages will use that, existent pages can be edited accordingly (may require file renamings)
**Change/redo [[Template:Shipquoteseasonal]] as [[Template:ShipQuoteSeasonal]] (internal: [[Template:ShipQuoteSeasonal/Row]]), improve naming, don't require audio arguments (may require file renamings)
**More [[Seasonal]] stuff
***Use something like [[Template:SeasonalTable]] ([[Template:SeasonalLine]])
***Find a way to sync. seasonal lines between [[Seasonal]] and ship pages (use external tool or decide on Lua granularity, i.e. many modules vs few/one module)
**Redo [[Template:Shipquote]] as [[Template:ShipQuotes]] (internal: [[Module:Quotes]]), better naming, some additional features, no audio parameters. Used on [[Iowa]] page, need documentation, can be used on new pages, existing pages can be converted (may require file renamings)
**Section on audio files in [[Help:Media]]
*Mechanics
**Mechanic calculations (mainly combat related) in Lua, to use in a generic table-generating templates like [[Template:Combat]] (internal: [[Module:Combat]], [[Module:Combat/Table]], [[Module:Combat/Tests]])
**[[Expedition/Support Expedition]], add aerial support info, use [[Template:Combat]] for tables.
**[[Sandbox/List of ships by combat performance]], use [[Template:Combat]] for tables, add a section on luck mod. priorities (raw difference between DA and CI damage and/or OHKO rates, explain armor dependency for gun cut-ins, add some examples, e.g. such ship with such equipment setup will have such damage ranges and OHKO rates vs. such enemy ship, etc., for different ships).
|-
|Temporarily dropped / possible projects

*Poi/KCDB/etc. based tables on drops, construction, development ([[Sandbox/Drop List]], [[Sandbox/Construction Recipes]], development tables, drops, construction, development tables on ship pages, etc.)

*Update [[Exercises (PvP)]] page

*[[User blog:がか/Sound Ripping Note]] (outdated)
