Hi, ErosenseiCecmomega here !

So i guess i should talk a bit about myself.. I'm french and player of KanColle since early 2015 i think, though i started really playing it in mid-2015. My HQ being level 103.

If i had to add anything, i might say that i'm more of an average player than a full time player, mainly because timezones but also because of other games i play.. My ressources might even show it most of the time lul.

Also, i stream, be it KanColle or other games so come have fun with me whenever you want : https://www.twitch.tv/erosensei_cecmomega
==My achievements==
Well, i guess i don't have much to say about it, beside surviving the Summer Event Hell from 2015, or more like not doing it and watching the salt from the sideline lul.

If anything else, from the Fall Event 2015 and onward, i did every event, completing them all but the one with Iowa.. But well, i wasn't interested in the ship and i'm sure she will drop again soon enough hue.

==My Married Kanmusus (And planning to)==
So far, i married :

# Haruna
# Junyou
# Yuudachi
# Shigure
# Abukuma
# Kitakami
# Maya
For the soon to marry (past level 90), it will be :
* Ooi
* Hiei
* Ashigara
* Hiyou
* RO500
* Akagi
* Kawakaze
* I19
* Kaga
* I26
And as for those i plan on marrying next... I guess that saying "Everyone" might be the only answer i can give.. If i were to be honest, i just love every girl in this game, they all got their own charmes and things that i will find lovable (though some might be made-up by the fandom lul) but yeah, that's about it.
== My luck==
If i had to say anything about my luck in the game is that i might be one of the luckiest player around, like when people are all farming to get the ships they want, i end up getting every single one of them while clearing the map... So yeah, people tend to be salty about it, i even remember getting kicked from the KanColle Discord for that... Fun time it was eheheh.

Well, as of now, my luck might have been sucked by some other gacha game i guess (mainly Granblue Fantasy and Girls' Frontline) so it might not be as much salt inducing as before.. Unluckily for me that is teehee.
