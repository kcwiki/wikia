Greetings.

I am a small fan of Kancolle, and have been playing World of Warships as of late. Beyond that, I'm still trying to get my pc to work with allowing me to play the game, but a few issues are finding me at a dead end. I've only seen the anime, can't wait for the next season and would have to say my favorite ship is Furutaka.
