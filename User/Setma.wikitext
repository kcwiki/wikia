Server: 鹿屋基地 (Kanoya Airfield)

I'm a dog chasing cars. What do I do with one when I've caught it? I guess I'll just chew on it or something.

As a teitoku, I'm probably the least efficient one that will ever touch this game. It took me 5 months to level my first ship to Kai Ni (Shigure), and probably going to take even longer now with increasing amounts of work. Ugh. 

I have failed to clear almost every event that I have participated in, dating back to Spring 2015. First completed event was Spring 2016. Go figure, it took me over a year to gather enough resources and determination to beat an event. Blah blah blah, self depricative speech about how I'll be forever alone, blah blah blah. I'll try to keep this synopsis short. 

'''Me doing events:'''

'''Spring 2015''': wtf is this how do combined fleet wut happening idk

(I'm sorry I couldn't save you Katsuragi ;w;)

'''Summer 2015''': Okay I think I get it, I just have to do this and that and that. No worries, amirit- oh shit, I have 1 hour left in the event. And I'm still on E-6.

DROP FARMING, GO!!!!!! (Only got Umikaze for my procrastination :P)

'''Fall 2015''': Swiggty Swoogity I'm coming for dat Akiduki booty~~ <333

(106 runs later, no Akizuki. Didn't even touch E-4, so no Pudding or Graf either. Also severely hampered by the lack of buckets because of obsessive fishing. At least I got the fish banner.)

'''Winter 2016''': ffs just let me beat this and get all the drops I want pl0x rngesus ;w;

(Well, I did get Hatsuzuki. Even got Akizuki too, so that's nice. Unfortunately, didn't get through E-3; ran out of resources and time. Still missing you, Zara, and you too Graf.)

'''Spring 2016: '''just kill me already, 7 maps with only 220 buckets and <30k resources, like hell that's gonna happen.

(As it turns out, I did it. 60 buckets to spare, and 6k fuel left, woo! Got a bunch of nice ships, but now what the hell am I gonna do next event...I'm so out of slots :v)

'''Summer 2016''': Wait, there's an event going on right now??!! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

(Didn't play for about 2 months beforehand. Panic Mode initiate) 

And that's that. Why did you read through all of that? Or more likely, why did you scroll all the way down to the end? Anyway. Kancolle servers are located in Bizarro World, so I hope you all never get the drops you want, and you fail to clear even E-1 on easy.  

じゃあね~
