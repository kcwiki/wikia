Hi, I'm Admiral Shinku (Lv 104) and I've been a ship girls admiral from March 2016. Please don't assume that I'm a good TTK just from my level because most of my kanmusu and equipments are still the same as other new TTK out there. 

Although my equipment are pretty much still basic, I can still able to beat the EO stage up to 4-5.

I usually can be found in discord chat, afk most of the time until events. My handler name, shinkurev

For events, I usually just do either Easy or Medium, depends on the drop rates reported earlier. I also volunteer to be front liner for Map1 and 2 in Medium difficulty. 

Just for the record, I really hate to do weekly quest especially BW1 and BW3. I even wonder why Tanaka make this quest as weekly instead of monthly.
