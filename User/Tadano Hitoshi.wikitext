==== <u>About This Admiral</u> ====
An Admiral who actually has been lurking around in this Wikia some time ago before registering, decided to have first-hand experience in the game on July 30, 2015. As of current I reside in Hashirajima Anchorage under the name タダノヒトシ.

Among translations I've worked on under anonymity that I can remember include:
*[[Shigure]]'s hourlies
*[[Fumizuki]]
*[[Unryuu]]'s hourlies
*[[Isokaze]]'s hourlies
*Added transcription of [[Ooyodo]]'s hourlies from the JP wiki to her page here. Did not translate it though.
Please be noted that while I have done these, I don't see myself as capable as a dedicated translator would. As you can see from the list I have quite the interest in a shipgirl's hourlies, because I think they showcase a good deal about the character. And that was before I started playing. I still have a bit of interest in them now, but for the time being, Kancolle anime? That existed? Ehem.

Outside this wiki, I am available via the following channels:

==== '''<u>Events</u>''' ====

Events that this naval base has gone through.

<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" > 

* [[Summer 2015 Event|Summer 2015]] - 3rd-class bearer. ''"Clean-up duty, finish them off as much as you can."'' Cleared up to E-6, E-7 last dance failed with 61/1850hp left for the map.
* [[Fall 2015 Event|Autumn/Fall 2015]] - E1 Hard, E2 Hard, E3 Easy, E4 Easy, E5 Easy. Event start on November 18, 2015; clear on November 20, 2015 (2 days total). 3rd-class bearer. ''"I'll do the backline clean-ups... Wait, what? I'm part of the Early Response Team!? I can't do that! ... okay, fine. Just let me fall back halfway.''"
* [[Winter 2016 Event|Winter 2016]] - 3rd class bearer. E1 Hard, E2 Medium, E3 Easy. ''"Admiral... I'm pretty sure we could aim for that First-class rank," said Nagato. The Admiral snickered. "Does prestige mean that much for you?" he said. "We keep our profile low and dirty because if it's too clean people would come to us and ask everything for us to do with no reward except by licking our feet when they ask and then as we turn our heads away they'll sneer and hiss. I only have ONE absolute order for everyone in the base - DO NOT SINK. Period."''
* [[Spring 2016 Event|Spring 2016]] - 3rd class bearer. E1-N, E2-N then dropped to E2-E due to insufficient armaments to deal with installations..., E3-E, E4-E, E6-E, E7-E, E5-E. ''"Commander-san, I guess even outside the fleet you have some... pretty formidable admirers. I mean, we should probably get the Aircraft Carrier Princess and Battleship Princess off you now," said Choukai. "Pretty please, I feel like I'm about a few fuses short of going volcanic right now," the Admiral replied, while ignoring one who's having his head in her bosom and the other one who's sniffing his butt.''
* [[Summer 2016 Event|Summer 2016]] - 3rd-class bearer. ''It's been one year and we're still on clean-up duty, thought Haruna. ''Meanwhile, there is a disturbance in the <strike>Force</strike> Fleet.
* [[Fall 2016 Event|Fall 2016]] - 3rd-class bearer. E-1N, E-2N, E-3E, E-4E, E-5E. Sakawa of the Crossroads Girls takes the MVP seat.
* [[Winter 2017 Event|Winter 2017]] - 3rd-class bearer. E-1H, E-2N, E-3E. ''"You know, it's high time you should actually try going along with the Marshal Admirals facing the Abyssals at their peak of power instead of falling back to do more clean-up jobs again" "I don't have much time. At first I did intend on trying to go along with it, but I have matters outside the base that keeps taking my attention away from my command post."''
* [[Spring 2017 Event|Spring 2017]] - 3rd-class bearer. E-1H, E-2H, E-3E, E-4E, E-5E. ''"You better start expanding the home port, you garbage Commander. Otherwise might as well we stop doing major operations and become home guards." "Right, right. Now if only I can get some things out of the way..."''
* [[Summer 2017 Event|Summer 2017]] - E-1M, E-2M, E-3M, E-4M, E-5E, E-6E, E-7E. 3rd-class bearer. ''"That was a long journey," thought Warspite.''
* [[Fall 2017 Event|Fall 2017]] - E-1M, E-2M, E-3M, E-4M but fell back to E-4E. ''"Finally, finally the deliverance that I've wanted... BUT WHAT'S WITH THIS SITUATION!" "Ufu~, what's wrong with you, isn't it a good thing we were finally reunited after two years~? Hmm? Even though you finally met the other me way much earlier... but that was also me ♪ How about we play some more~?" "Stop, other me, please..."''

#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Operation Ringlord and Everyday Hustle 4|The Admiral retrieves The One Ring in secret.&nbsp;]]'''Also, some of the shipgirls bring the Admiral out to town.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Everyday Hustle 5 - Pocky Madness & Strange Maya & Fall Operation Preparations|The fleet's top guns go berserk]]''' over the Pocky Game, the Admiral blows his fuse. They then prepare for Fall ops.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Meditation - Eve of Fall Operations|The Admiral contemplates his belly]]''' over some things prior to the beginning of Fall ops.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle - Fall 2015 Event Edition|Fall 2015 Operations]]''' - Sendai's Bizarre Night Battles the (RNG-laden) Game. Choukai bares her night-time fangs.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Everyday Hustle 6: A New Season for New Greetings for New Comrades|Time for new comrades to settle in.]]''' The Aganos quickly finds themselves comfortable in the base, Graf makes friends with Nagato, Admiral spoils Akizuki with food (as well as unfortunately letting out the truth about Teruzuki), and... the Nagumo Mobile Fleet learns about Arashi's tiny mistake that cost them the Battle of Midway.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Every Hustle 7: A New Year for New Beginnings|The Admiral gets sick for the New Year]]''' and the fleet sends some shipgirls to visit. Then they meet an old friend of his.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle - Winter 2016 Event Edition|Winter 2016 Operations]]''' - Kasumi, joining and trained rather quickly to be in time for the operations, relives her memory of Operation Rei-go only with a major change in the fleet roster.
#About the Admiral's fleet prior to Spring 2016. [[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Everyday Hustle 8: The Admiral's Fleet at Hashirajima Anchorage - Part One.|Part One]] | [[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Everyday Hustle 8: The Admiral's Fleet at Hashirajima Anchorage - Part Two.|Part Two]] | [[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Everyday Hustle 8: The Admiral's Fleet at Hashirajima Anchorage - Part Three.|Part Three]] | [[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Everyday Hustle 8: The Admiral's Fleet at Hashirajima Anchorage - Part Four.|Part Four.]]
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle - Spring 2016 Event Edition|Spring 2016 Operations]]''' - Choukai in charge of operation logging as well as snatching the overall MVP for the event. Battleship Princess and Carrier Princess all too happy to see their little boy again, while the fleet picks up a stray Teruzuki.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Everyday Hustle 9: Rainy Season, also "In Vino, Veritas."|A handful of the fleet's top guns - now known as the Ninety-Niners - learn about Admiral's possession of The One Ring.]]''' They then decide to step up their game - while hopefully avoiding the Pocky Game Day incident. Ashigara realizes how dense she was and gets drunk for it. Others: Iowa tries to goad the Admiral for a one-night stand because she needed the relief after the long trip from the States; Teruzuki tries to fight her dark desires.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - Behind the Curtain, Within the Shadows|Admiral and the submariners learn from Choukai]]''' a not-so-good piece of information regarding a certain shipgirl in the base. They then start taking actions in the sidelines to investigate. In the mean time, a spooky atmosphere looms towards the naval base from a faraway land.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle Edition - The Admiral's Decision: Marriage (Temp) - Kekkon Kakko Kari (ケッコンカッコカリ)|The Admiral finally makes his mind up about The One Ring.]]''' But not before he makes everyone know that there shall not be only one bearer of the ring and that there are many, many Rings, and letting them know of his intent to obtain more of it should the opportunity arise.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle Kancolle - Summer 2016 Event Edition|Summer 2016 Operations]]''' - Haruna in charge of operation logging as well as being part of the fleets sortieing near modern-day Malaya waters. As it is the Admiral's home waters, naturally he gets very aggressive in his actions during fleet combat... but not without being alarmed at Battleship Princesses donning bikinis and running after him at shore. In the sidelines, some members of the fleet confirm their worst suspicions.
#Seasons pass, and the Admiral's fleet finds itself '''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle KanColle Edition: The "Second Pocky War"- Action report.|on the verge of a second "Pocky War" much larger in scale than the previous]]''' now that his fleet has essentially doubled in size. Factions form, and the Admiral received a suggestion from Ooyodo to make it a wargame in preparation for the upcoming operations. Naturally, he went all out to ensure achievement denial to each of the factions' objectives - sharing a Pocky stick with him, mouth to mouth.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle KanColle Edition - Everyday Hustle 10: Seasonal Passage|Seasons continues to pass as the Admiral keeps himself busy outside the base]]''' with barely time to document his two past major operations as of current - [[Fall 2016 Event|Fall]] and [[Winter 2017 Event|Winter]], and as he returns he has to deal with more of his capital ships' shenanigans. Fortunately, he has appointed Kasumi to dig him out of unfortunate situations where the larger girls make their move on him. Other happenings: The Admiral demonstrate his skill and tenacity in hand-to-hand combat with Nagato. Meanwhile, something happens in the darkness of the night... followed by a rainy morning's newsflash in television.
#'''[[User blog:Tadano Hitoshi/Ragtag Hustle KanColle Edition - Spring 2017 Event Edition - A Frosty End to Spring|Spring comes around]]''' and the Admiral decided to be quick on the clean-up due to business outside the naval base. After the operations, a certain battleship gets a new remodel and received it with much joy... until she learns of the trade-off she gained for the remodel.
