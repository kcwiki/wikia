Hi people iam from Germany and pretty new to the game so pls be gentle.

Joined the community end of November 2017.



'''How i got into the game:'''

If u ever look at artwork and you are wondering why every artist/anime has about 1000 pictures, but Kancolle has 200k you get curious.

Season 1 and one film later, i remembered there was a game.

Lets check Youtube, first video that came up "How to use Kongou" from "[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSD9bXhcIFf8kZg_TT-jLEw RYAN C00P3R".]

Lauged my ass off and decided to try it out.

Enjoying it since then to the fullest.
