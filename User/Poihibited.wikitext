== Event History ==
Spring 2015 - Cleared Easy up to E-3, couldn't go any further, because heck, not enough time to level ships.

Summer 2015 - We all know the bullshit that people went through in E-7...

Fall 2015 - First A-class medal. Incredibly easy overall, was fairly pleased.[[File:My Reaction to Rare Drops.gif|thumb|285x285px|My Reaction to Rare Drops.]]

Winter 2016 - Didn't bother farming on this one, I went on vacation throughout half the event... Still cleared E1 Hard, E2 and E3 on Normal, and rest easy.

Spring 2016 - Pfft, last minute grinding netted me two Yuu's, got to love the Subway guide...

Summer 2016 - Cleared E-1 Normal, E-2 Hard, E-3 Easy, E-4 Normal. I don't regret my decision, managed to farm some of the other drops I wanted.

== Current Event ==

=== Goals ===
* Farm rare drops. (Accomplished for the most part. Got all except Nemu and Aquila.)
* Clear E-3 on Hard, and E-4 on Normal+ (MEH. See above.)
* Don't get salty over not getting rare drops. (Didn't get salty at all about drops, lmao. Considering my run history.)
* Don't get salty over not getting to boss node in one piece. (Pfft, E1 and E2 were cakewalks, and E3E and E4N were easy af.)
* Don't get salty enough to throw phone across room. (Ha. Didn't even play KC on my phone.)
* Did I mention "Don't get salty?"

=== E-1 ===
Honestly, this went great. Got Akitsushima after only grinding for 18 runs, and cleared E-1 without much difficulty. I actually gained buckets, steel, and bauxite, and only lost ~1k fuel and ammo, so pretty pleased as to how smoothly E-1 went...

=== E-2 ===
Ridiculously easy. Was farming Prinz on Easy, but I thought about it, and farming on Hard wasn't even that bad. Had to clear E3 as well though, wanted the extra LBAS in lieu of support expeditions. ~30 runs on Easy, ~20 runs on Hard to get Prinz. Also got craploads of Yayoi/Uzuki.

=== E-3 ===
I kind of didn't want to do E3H after thinking about it, and don't regret it anymore, especially after I got most of the drops I was aiming for. Lots of rare drops, in a small of amount of farming. Great.

=== E-4 ===
Surprisingly easy, provided that you did Easy/Normal. No support expeditions required, and 95% rate of getting to boss.
