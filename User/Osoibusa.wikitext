Started playing almost at the start of Arpeggio-event, more specific - 26 december 2013. Still playing everyday and in the end became addicted to KC, can't even imagine my life without refreshing expeditions and farming maps anymore. Right now my life before KC feels like previous life, like it wasn't even me, lol. Besides that, nothing interesting. Thanks for reading this mindless piece of my thoughts.
