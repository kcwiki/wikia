Hey everyone! AegisXI here at your service! I've been playing Kancolle for 2 years now and will be playing it for unknown length. I got interested in playing Kancolle when I read all the doujinshis that were released. I consider myself a veteran kancolle player, but not a frontliner. Never will be a frontliner and never even consider to be one!Â 

My Favorite ships:

I have way to many to even list them all and I don't want to list them all. But if I were to pick one ship out of all of them it would be my shipgirl Kashima <3!

If you have anything to say, please drop a message and I'll try and get back to you ASAP :). Happy sortying everyone!

Pet Peeve: Please don't act tough or sound condescending towards me. Makes you look like an idiot to me and to others. Another thing, dont have your little bunch of friends back you up online... cuz thats just sad and it doesnt bode well.
