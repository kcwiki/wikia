| style="text-align: left;" rowspan="1"| The feeling I have for Hiyou is one of the most complex and most difficult for me to explain. She's the last CVL to join the fleet (excluding Taigei), but she somehow won my heart. I wanted to go everywhere with her, so I brought her to 4-3 when I trained up the DDs for Summer 15 event and she reliable most of the time. And when I deploy to said event, I feel safe bringing her along. I used her on E-2 and E-7 (as combined fleet FS in E-7) and she brought me victory too. So far, in every big or decisive battle, she's the one who stay by my side, and I want to be with her, so there goes, my first ring.

| style="text-align: left;" rowspan="1"| Ah, this one is simple. She's one of the girls that introduce me this game since she's practically the game's mascot (along with Shimakaze). Back then, I only know her as an English returnee so she has some degree of English and she loves tea, which I also like. I get to know her better when the anime came out, I found out another side of her. I saw that with her usual cheerful (and someone might call bonkers) facade, she's also has a reliable and dependable side, which shows up when she led the fleet, saved Fubuki from Ru-class BARE-HANDED, and comfort her in difficult days, I knew right in that moment that I want this girl by my side, thus I joined the game.

| style="text-align: left;" rowspan="1"| At first, I only know her as moderate stat CV, with gentle and humble personality, so I had my eye on her a bit since she's the first CV I got (500/500/500/500), yep, even before I know Akagi quest exists. But then, Summer 2015 Event came, with [[File:Prototype Deck Catapult.png|30px]] as reward in Medium mode or above. Due to my faulty planning, the girls I assigned for E-6 tag can't handle Medium, so I had to switch down to Easy. Of course, that means I failed her. At first, I didn't feel anything, since I sacrifice the item for Teruzuki, who I successfully rescued. But after the event, after failing her, she still remained the same, caring, soft, understanding, sweet and gentle. As time pass, I knew that I hurt the girl who's been with me almost the longest and she's still gladly call me her admiral, which shames me a lot. And when she got K2, finding out that Konishi fucked up her K2 and K2A arts means after remodeling, the Shoukaku I know will be changed forever, yes she's still Shoukaku she won't be the same anymore. This left me depress for weeks. Then, I came to the term that to truly love someone, sometimes you have to let go and let them grow, so I decided that I'd marry her as Kai first then I'll remodel her later. She's now in CVB form, strong, a bit more stern than she was, but to me, she's still warm, gentle and caring for me. Those sweet eyes in her Kai form will always be in my heart.

|-| Lost Comrades =

I thought over and over if I should make this section since this is the dark, shameful part of my Admiral career, then I decided it'd be an insult to their memory not to, so here goes.



*{{ShipBattleCardKai|Shigure|damaged=true|grayscale = true|layers=status_sunk}}

It was back in my early days. We were in 1-3 and I wasn't paying full attention so I was oblivious if anyone was Taiha'd (I didn't use any plugin back then), further more, I was still new to the game so I couldn't remember which of the 2 buttons was retreat, so I hit proceed. I closed the game in an instance when I saw that she was Taiha'd right after the battle at boss node had already started. She was gone when I boot the game up again. This made it stick into my brain which button is which, and the fact that the battle results was decided right after the battle starts.


*{{ShipBattleCardKai|Maruyu|damaged=true|grayscale = true|layers=status_sunk}}

This one was out of my Kuso-ness, I have no excuse on that. It was also back in my early days when I'd just start Orel cruising. Hope that level will help her a bit so I deployed her there as well. She got Taiha'd at node C. Since she's been the cause of retreat of many prior runs, I rage proceeded since I thought there weren't much threat for subs in the end nodes. Then I end up at boss node in the formation selection screen. I didn't remember that one of the boss forms was diamond which poses big threat to the subs, so I selected the formation and hope for the best. {{ShipBattleCardKai|Torpedo Cruiser Chi-Class}} sunk her right before my eyes, and that was the first (and only) time I saw a LOST animation on my screen. When I retreat, it felt weird not seeing her in the slots but in the library, but I excused myself by saying that there was one more room open for more useful girls. But then, seeing the rest of the subs, damaged in the dock, I saw a picture in my head, a picture of the subs squad injured in the docks, some are crying for the lost, others trying to comfort each other. Seeing that picture, tears were flowing uncontrollably before I knew it. After I'd coped for the lost, I decided to stop sortieing completely until I craft her back, since I was still an newbie so I couldn't gain much resources back then. I never knew I could be this overjoyed of seeing Maruyu out of LSC, well sure I was back then. After I got her back, I made a vow not to sink anyone ever again.
