* Bio
I joined the Kantai Collection community November of 2013, just in time to see the Ironbottom Sound event finish. The following event, Kancolle x Arpeggio, was my first real event, and my first event cleared. I've played the game just about every day I've had access to a computer, to include playing the game during both classes at college and work, even. Spring 2015 was the first event I started recording and subsequently uploading to Youtube, and continued to the Summer 2015 event. Fall 2015 Event was my first front-line stream, although I had to stop at E3 due to computer issues. During this same event, I managed to catch up on missed ships from previous events, and am proud to finally say that I actively possess every shipgirl in the game. 

Going into my own personal history, Kancolle is not my first time being an Admiral. I was Admiral of my own fleets across several MMOs in the past, to include Star Wars Galaxies and EVE Online. Now in Kantai, I can't seem to get out of the Marshall Admiral rank. Outside of Kantai, I'm an active player of War Thunder, Phantasy Star Online 2, League of Legends (though I suck at it), and Space Engineers, primarily. 

I'm mostly a lurker here on the Wiki, but I'll pop into the chat every now and again. I'm also a member of the Facebook groups and follow quite a lot of front-liners on Twitter, mostly for Event info. My first and only fluent language is English, though I can speak anywhere between basic to conversational Japanese and Chinese. 

Thank you for visiting my page, and fair waters to you and your fleets in Kantai Collection.

* Ships Lost
Since I started, I've actually lost very few ships, at least compared to what I hear on both the Facebook groups and Wiki chat. If anything, I'm more upset by what I equipment I lost in the process, compared to the ship itself. I don't do sparkle runs often, if at all, so there's only a handful of other ships not listed here.
# Kitakami (41) -  Accidental continue while farming. Lost 3 Type A Hyoteki
# Fusou (50) -  Spring 2014 on E3. Last chance to get Amatsukaze on E3. Succeeded, in exchange for Fusou and one of my two Seirans.
# Suzuya (71) - Summer 2014 (AL/MI) on E2. Got irritated since it was always her who went into the red. Lost her and my second Seiran.
