=== Destroyer (DD) ===
Points for equipment selection:
* is the enemy's armor tough? if so, how high is your ship's luck stat {{Luck}}?
* Do you need a dedicated destroyer for anti-submarine duties?
* Is an Anti-Air Cut-In necessary?
* Are you fighting against an installation?

====Standard Setup====
* {{RedGunLight}}'''OR'''{{GreenGunDP}}Main Gun x2 + Wildcard
* Using 2x Main Guns allows Double Attack for destroyers in night battle.
* '''Wildcard''' can be anything except a {{RedGunLight}},{{GreenGunDP}} or {{TorpedoWeapon}}
** Adding '''any''' {{TorpedoWeapon}} or a 3rd {{RedGunLight}}/{{GreenGunDP}} to this setup will turn it into an inferior cut-in attack.
** {{Radar}}[[List of Radars by stats|Surface Radar]] Surface Radar is most preferable for '''Wildcard'''



|-|AACI=
* these setups can be used for AACI while also able to perform double attack at night battle like the standard setup:

====Standard AACI Setup====
*Any destroyer can use this setup
*prioritize using these setup on {{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}}
*'''not recommended''' using this setup on other destroyers when {{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}} is using any AACI setup
===={{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}} backup AACI====
*Only posible with {{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}}, not rely on {{GreenGunDP}}{{EquipmentLink|10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|text=10cm HA+AAFD}} to trigger their unique AACI
*{{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}} should be using standard AACI setup , only use this setup if lacking {{GreenGunDP}}{{EquipmentLink|10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|text=10cm HA+AAFD}}

===={{ShipLink|Hamakaze B Kai}} / {{ShipLink|Isokaze B Kai}} setup====
*unique AACI setup only for {{ShipLink|Hamakaze B Kai}} and {{ShipLink|Isokaze B Kai}} 
*Stronger than standard AACI setup and only need 0~1 {{GreenGunDP}}{{EquipmentLink|10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|text=10cm HA+AAFD}}
**not strong as {{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Suzutsuki|Hatsuzuki|text=Akizuki class}} AACI

====Night Battle Cut-in type====
*{{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Torpedo]] x2 + any
* Setup for the strongest cut-in attack at night, but inconsistent.
* You are recommended to use this setup only when you are facing high armor targets.
* Chance to trigger this cut-in attack is based on ship's {{Luck}}luck
**This setup is recommended for only high {{Luck}}luck destroyers such as {{ShipLink|Yukikaze/Kai}}, {{ShipLink|Shigure/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Hatsushimo/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Ayanami/Kai Ni}} and those with luck increased via modernization (above 35 {{Luck}}luck).
* You can improve your Cut In trigger rate with night battle gear like {{StarShell}}[[Star Shell]] or {{SurfaceShipPersonnel}}[[Skilled Lookouts]]. Flagships also have a higher trigger chance.
* Any other [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Night_Battle_Special_Attacks Cut In] setups are inferior to the Torpedo Cut In and are not recommended.
*For wildcard slot:
**{{TorpedoWeapon}} for more damage
**{{StarShell}} or {{SurfaceShipPersonnel}} to increase trigger rate

====ASW(Anti-Submarine Warfare)====
* Equip enough sonars{{Sonar}}/depthcharge{{DepthCharge}} to raise ship's {{ASW}} ASW stat above 100 to be able to perform [[Partials/Opening ASW|OASW]]
* There is a synergy effect when equipping at least a {{Sonar}} '''AND''' {{DepthCharge}}, which improves ASW damage by 15%
* Note that while synergy effect is important, being able to perform OASW is even more important. If you can only perform OASW by equipping 3x {{Sonar}}, simply do that.
* As ASW damage is heavily reliant on equipment, be careful that your damage output doesn't suffer too much by using your 3rd slot as a '''Wildcard'''.
====ships with high {{ASW}} base stat/OASW ship====
* This setup utilizes Depth Charge Projector(DCP) and Depth Charge(DC) synergy 
* again, being able to perform OASW is even more important, only use this setup if you are sure your ship can perform [[Partials/Opening ASW|OASW]]
