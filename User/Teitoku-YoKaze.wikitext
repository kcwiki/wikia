== Hai hai~! Teitoku-Yokaze here, pleased to meet y'all! ==
[[File:Myself IRL.jpg|thumb|226x226px]]
For starters, my ingame name is '''YoKaze''', and I'm in the Rabaul Server. I started playing Kancolle on 4th April 2015, but I left the game for nearly a year from September 2015 to July 2016 because I was really busy, thus my current "low" HQ level (98).

I have been playing on a daily basis since August 2016, mainly following the guides of Shinhwalee (Death Usagi). They are worth it, so go and check them out!

I was planning to go all hard for the first time in the Fall 2016 Event, but thanks to Godamn Tanaka there is a freaking Orange shiplock in E5, and since I lack high level DDs I can't do it...

== Now, time for my Fall 2016 achievements: ==
{{Progress|60}}<u>E1 Medium</u> : '''DONE'''

<u>E2 Hard</u> : '''DONE'''

After E2:

}}
<u>E3 Medium</u> : '''DONE '''

I planned to do E3 in hard, but since I couldn't do any clean kills and time is precious, I switched to Normal...
