=== Actually, you don't have to mind me ===

So, why have you stumbled across this page? How did you, even? Makin' no sense.
Anyway, this page here is completely useless to anyone other than me. Why?, you may ask.
The reason is pretty simple.
I just use it as an overview for Kanmusu I have leveled sufficiently and still have to level. c:


== Ships I Have Leveled/Kai Ni'd/Maxed/Whateverthehell ==
{{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Yuudachi|model=Kai Ni}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Shimakaze|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Ryuujou|model=Kai Ni}}


== Ships With A High Priority To Level ==
{{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Bismarck|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Yahagi}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Noshiro}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Hatsuzuki}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Haruna|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Shoukaku|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Hibiki|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Maya|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Shigure|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Souryuu|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Sendai|model=Kai}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Hiryuu}}


== Ships I Still Have To Get ==
{{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Yamato}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Akizuki}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Ooyodo}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Agano}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Sakawa}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Taihou}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Zuihou}}


So, uh, yeah-ish.

Have some of my get-to sites on this wiki while you're here anyway~
*[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Construction Construction]
*MORE TO BE EDITED. AM LAZY.

So, yeah. That's that.

Have a nice day~


== Current Event's Farming Progress & Achievement List ==
Not a whole lot so far.Â 

{{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Ooyodo}} {{ShipBattleCardKai|name=Zara}}; both dropped in E2 TP phase.

Other than that, I'm running low on buckets, my Hatsuzuki is becoming a taiha-magnet and E3-P2 is being a bitch. So far, the event's going wunderfully for me. /s
