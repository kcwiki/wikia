<br />This IQ slowly crumbles away
<br />All this salt of mine shall not be healed
<br />And all I do is stare out this window 
<br />Trapped in my own privileged middle-class family home 
<br />I continue to peel oranges 
<br />My skin looks darker 
<br />As the clock ticks away 
<br />My IQ ever so shortened 
<br />By this senseless feeling of edginess
<br />Who knew after a year on this wiki, so much anarchy could happen. Oh that's right, everyone did because the whole fucking point of a wiki is that anyone can edit.

Nice touch mate, I actually enjoyed your poem. Too bad you had to be so fucking salty about not getting anything at all. Dank meme mate, 3edgy5me
