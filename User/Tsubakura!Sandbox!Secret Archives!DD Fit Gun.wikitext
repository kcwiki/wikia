'''Unknown factors:'''
* Only {{ShipLink|Yura Kai Ni|text=Yura K2}} and {{ShipLink|Satsuki Kai Ni|text=Satsuki K2}} were tested. It's unknown whether the other ships in the same class would receive the same bonus or whether it only works for specific remodels.
* It has not been tested with multiple guns, it's unknown whether it works the same as the other fit mechanics.
* It is unknown whether the [[12.7cm Single Gun Mount]] gives a fit bonus or not.

Use [[Destroyer Ha-Class]] as basis for map [[1-1]] and [[1-2]], the stats are 16 {{Evasion}} and 1 {{Luck}}.

If you're absolutely sure that the map used in tests is [[1-1]], use [[Light Cruiser Ho-Class]] as basis instead, which has 15 {{Evasion}} and 1 {{Luck}}.
