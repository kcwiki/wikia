'''Opinion on Kantai Collection Shoujo Ai: '''I'm not a supporter of it and I only ship Admiral x Ship girl pairings. To be honest, I have history as an ex-yuri fan boy, who was rather obsessed with Shoujo Ai in the past. That obsession however, brought me more negative than anything good and made me unable to enjoy many different anime shows and games. Perhaps partly due to that, I dislike Kancolle Shoujo Ai - there is also the fact how lovey-dovey many ship girls are towards the player / admiral, and also the marriage system. I'm just unable to see any ship girl as a lesbian aside from certain someones, though to be honest even them I like to think of as bisexual. I do like Shoujo Ai when it comes to certain other games though, such as the Atelier and Hyperdimension Neptunia series.

'''Base: '''Sukumo Bay (Honestly, I'd prefer if my base was somewhere in Hokkaido. I'm not a fan of heat...)



I am an appreciator of anything I, myself, consider cute and / or beautiful. That is the main essence for my enthusiasm towards many aspects of modern Japanese culture, and the main reason why I am today here as a proud admiral, in this wikia. Obviously, there are many other peculiarities inside modern Japanese culture I highly enjoy, such as how crazy Japanese media or in particular the anime / manga / game culture is. Where else do you find a tsundere high school girl who shoots at her crush with a rocket launcher and a minigun? Where else do you find thousand year-old little girl drunkards with supernatural powers? Where else do you find a Neo-Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon? Nowhere else, and that is one of the reasons why I love modern Japanese culture.


If you are the type to enjoy reading character profiles, take a look below: I've listed my personal fleets and written comments of each ship girl from the perspective of an ''almost ''all-knowing narrator, who also gives out opinions that are not always in accordance to mine. (Note: the comments regarding ship girls and their behaviour and such are based on how they are/would be in ''my ''fleet. What is written here is not necessarily an universal truth, so don't take what I've written ''too ''seriously.) (WORK IN PROGRESS)

<p style="font-weight:normal;text-align:center;">Flagship of the first destroyer division, she holds one of the most important positions in the navy. Her combat strength may be a bit lacking, but her long service and experience more than makes up for it. She has also received training in leading others from her admiral personally, and as such, she is a good leader, though she has been prone to overconfidence at times.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Ikazuchi, with her natural cuteness, cheerful and active personality, is the first ship girl to have captured admiral Nep-Nep's heart.

It is true she acts very blunt towards the others, including other ship girls and especially her admiral, but if her behaviour is observed more, it can be noticed she is incredibly hard-working, sharp and one to take her duties extremely seriously, and no one works that hard in such a duty if fueled only by negative feelings. Behind her hard outer shell exists a gentle side with genuine concern for others - her harsh words towards other girls serve as a guidance in order for them to do well. She surely hated her admiral at first, but now from her diligent actions for her admiral's sake it can be seen that her emotions have evolved into something else.Â </span>

However, after arriving to admiral Nep-Nep's fleet, she has learned to take things less seriously. She has an adorable, childish side to her too, which most often shows in the way of her looking for praise or acknowledgement from others. All the praise she receives is well-deserved as one of the most reliable ships in the navy. She has shown this childish side more often recently.</span>

Most likely, she has earned a place in the admiral's heart, but there are many other tough competitors...</span>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Flagship of the two-members large aviation battleship division. Her early combat records are of a more supportive nature, but with hard work and upon the arrival of her and her sister's remodel, the Fusou sisters have become some of admiral Nep-Nep's most trusted ship girls.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">She has some of the aspects of "yamato nadeshiko" and is a truly beautiful girl who seems to be attracted towards her admiral, but her personality does have some darkness to it... I wonder, has her personality had an influence on Shigure?</p>

| style="text-align:center;background-color:pink;"|

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Her personality is darker than her sister's, but in all honesty, her much more energetic nature actually gives her a more brighter image when compared to her sister, despite Yamashiro's occasional mood swings leading to a brief lethargy and even depression at times (it can be noted, she doesn't let this affect her duties, however). She has been very attached to her sister, almost to the point of an obsession - however, as she has grown a strong bond with her admiral and shown great care and concern towards him, it can be noted she can genuinely care for other people, which isÂ <span style="font-weight:normal;">a healthy trait in any given person.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">The Fusou sisters are deeply affected by their reputation in their past lives and are seeking to redeem themselves with hard work. (Which they have succeeded in, in their admiral's eyes.)</p>

| style="text-align:center;"|
<p style="font-weight:normal;">Flagship of the heavy battleship division, she is the true "yamato nadeshiko" of the whole navy. Really, she is just simply perfect. She does have a clumsy side to her, but that makes her even more perfect. In fact, she is almost too perfect...</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Her power is tremendous and only to be utilized in the most difficult operations, which leaves her with a lot of pressure. However, even though she is easily flustered off-duty, she is the type to perform well under stress, which together with her mind, charisma and strength makes her a fitting leader.

<p style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-weight:normal;text-align:start;">The more masculine part of the Yamato-class, her immense battle strength and combativeness serves as an inspiration to all ship girls. Watching her battle is a truly fearsome sight, enough to make even her admiral feel shivers in his spine (not that it is a difficult thing to do towards admiral Nep-Nep). However, she has a warm heart and shows extreme kindness towards her allies. It seems that both, Yamato and Musashi are idolized by some of the ship girls, and it is a small wonder why. She too is a good leader - those glasses are not just for show!</span></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Unlike the Yamato-sisters, Mutsu's combat strength is not in such overpowered, difficult-to-utilize levels, but she is fairly strong in her own right, and she has proven herself reliable for even the most difficult operations for which the Yamato-sisters are often reserved for.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Mutsu has a sultry aura - it is not just that her appearance is attractive, but her behaviour too has an enthralling, feminine charm to it... She is very aware of her charms and enjoys teasing her admiral. I'm jealous...</p>

| style="text-align:center;background-color:pink;"|
<span style="font-weight:normal;text-align:start;">Flagship of the first carrier division, she is thought of as one of the cornerstones in admiral Nep-Nep's fleet, which may very well be true considering her awesome strength, experience and extremely strong bond with her admiral - she was there since the early days of her admiral's carreer, and helped to shape the navy to the point where it is now, while becoming extremely close to the admiral. She is fairly serious, hard-working and active, though she has a hint of timidness to her which is visible at times, and at first she was quite unsure of her abilities, most likely due to the events in her previous life.Â </span>

Due to worry for her lazy admiral's bad living habits, she often tries to drag her admiral to exercise with her, but she also can't help but spoil the admiral at some other times too. (What are you doing you lazy admiral, you are supposed to be an example to your ship girls...?)
