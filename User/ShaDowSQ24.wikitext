==No matter how hard to get S-Rank, it always end up with 2-4-11 or Maruyu *sigh* (Update 30/11/2015)==
Hello everyone!

Introduce
*... Call me SQ24
*Teitoku name: my admiral name? No I don't tell you. (Sound like Akitsushima)
*Teitoku level: 105
*Server: <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">ショートランド泊地 (Shootorando Hakuchi, Shortland Anchorage)</span>
*Highest rank: <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;text-align:center;">大将 (Admiral)</span>
*<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;text-align:center;">Total ship: 156/180</span>
*<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;text-align:center;">Starter Ship: Inazuma</span>
*<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;text-align:center;">My first Destroyer: Inazuma (yes, she is =_=") next is Wakaba</span>
*My first Light Cruiser: Yuubari (got her after Wakaba by construstion with 30/30/30/30 1:22:00 pop up. I think "why destroyer bulid so long?" when I got her ...oh she is Light Cruiser. next I sortie her with Inazuma and Wakaba, She gets moderate damage by enemy DD by gunfire, she looks so weak =_=". I didn't leveling her to much but now she levels 63.
*My first Heavy Cruiser: Chikuma (by construstion)
*My first Battleship: Kongou-desu (by construstion)
*My first Light Carrier: Houshou (drop in 1-3)
*My first Standard Carrier: Akagi (by Quest)
*My first Submarine: Goya-dechi (drop in 1-5)
*Highest ship level: 98 (Kirishima, Yamato, Musashi)
*My favourite ship: Isokaze (she gonna be my Waifu...eh? Saber????) , Taihou, Yamato, Haguro and Hachi.
*Dislike ship (I have reason): 
​1. Shoukaku. She always get moderate damage easier and in PvP she always "miss" her target (I use my               best plane but she still miss) she now level 76. 

<span style="line-height:20px;">        2. Kitakami and Yukikaze same reason always do night cut-in except in boss node. =_="</span>

<span style="line-height:20px;">        3. Shigure (always get </span>moderate damage easier but she still nice timing to do night cut-in)

(Note: I dislike, it isn't mean I "hate" her. I still leveling her and hope someday she will done something nice.)
*===My wish ship===
*Rank S: Amagi (I have all Carrier except her), Bismarck (Z1 and Z3 please... T-T"), Prinz Eugen, Akizuki'''(Now get in Fall event 2015 E-3) ''''''and''' Taigei(please T-T")
*Rank A: Sakawa (I can get her in 6-2 everytime don't want too much but still want her), Yahagi, Amatsukaze.
*Rank B: Harusame, Shioi, Mikuma, some more Maruyu '''(ENOUGH!!! PLEASE - -*)'''.

Sorry for some Englist mistake, Nice to meet you all!
