==Introduction==
Greetings all Admirals! Welcome to Shinhwalee/Death Usagi's Guide to Preparing for Major Events. This Guide was made in order to help all Admirals new or old alike in order to prepare for the Seasonal Major Events (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) that takes place every year.

This Guide will cover everything from training your ships, Equipment setup, gaining resources, which ships should be prepared and are mandatory for the Event to have an easier time in Branching Rules, Event Map mechanisms, and to prepare you for the worst in regards to the Event.

It is a limited-time Event (ranging from 2 to 4 weeks) that lets you go through a major operation to clear difficult maps while obtaining Major Exclusive-Rewards that are only available from the Event which includes Ships, Equipments, and sometimes an Item, which takes place every season Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.

<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Events are also known as the only place where some ships that are impossible to obtain from normal maps or requires to be constructed become obtainable in the Event Maps (Ex. Unryuu, Isokaze, Harusame). Events also start dropping previous Event Reward-only ships in some maps after about 2 Events.</span>

These events are based on real World War campaigns that the Japanese War Ships have participated in the past and some Bosses seem to be apparently based on some of the ships that actually sunk during the real campaign (Ex. [[Light Cruiser Demon|Light Cruiser Oni]] = [[Naka]] + [[Agano]],[[ Destroyer Princess]] = [[Harusame]]).

An Event's scale is scaled from Small, Medium and Large.

If we take a look at examples of previous events that took place, but only for the ones that took place after the Difficulty Selection feature;
===='''Small Event'''====

[[Winter 2016 Event]] - The first Small-scaled Event after the Difficulty system was implemented. As the name states, it only consisted of 3 maps total which made things very easy for many players even if they were quite new to the game.
===='''Medium Event'''====

[[Summer 2016 Event]] - Medium-scale Event of year 2016. Was a Summer-themed Event with Abyssals wearing Swimsuit also ([[Battleship Summer Princess|Dat Ass]]). Event was fairly easy overall for a lot of Admirals except Beginners, and it was a major farming festival as well.  
===='''Large Event'''====

[[Spring 2016 Event]] - The most recent Large Scale event which took several players by surprise of how difficult it was to clear it. This Event had a massive requirement for Anti-Landbase equipment and Ships that are able to utilize it. The major problem was that the equipment themselves were extremely difficult or perhaps impossible to obtain for some people due to the method of availability to obtain them (Ex. WG42 was only acquirable through U-511 and Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89) and Special Type 2 Amphibious Landing Craft were only available via either Quests or through Upgrades via Akashi's Improvement Arsenal). This event also had introduced the new mechanism called the <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Landing Based Aircrafts</span> and the bases to utilize them, which some of the players couldn't afford to use properly due to major requirement of bauxite and powerful aircrafts. Another thing was how the Event had for the first time, introduced a full Hime-class Enemy Boss Fleet in E-7 Hard Mode. Even in the previous E-6, multiple Hime classes were present in the Boss node.
Most Admirals participated in these Events to challenge themselves using the Ship Girls they have worked hard to raise while obtaining exclusive rewards which they can enjoy raising.

One thing to note is that majority of Reward Ships & Equipment that you obtain from clearing each Event Map are very good in stats and the ships themselves have very good stock equipments (Ex. [[Prinz Eugen]] who was a reward for Fall 2014 Event E-3, has extremely good Guns and Radar), which makes it worth trying to obtain them for yourself.
===Event Participation requirements===
* Must have a 75% sortie win ratio
* Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships
* Must have 20 free equipment slots
===Special Event Mechanics===
# '''[[Combined Fleet]] '''(Click to see the details)
# '''[[Line of Sight|Effective Line of Sight]]''' requirements on all maps to reach Boss or certain routes.
# '''Ship Locking''': A mechanism where if a ship participates in a certain Event map, that ship cannot participate in the other maps until the semi-final and the final maps. (Ex. A ship that participates in E-1 or E-2 cannot participate in E-3, but may be able to participate in E-4 or E-5). Very critical towards players who do not have a large pool of properly trained ships to use in the Event. Does not apply to Admirals who only go through Easy mode.
# '''[[Land Base Aerial Support]]''': A new mechanism introduced in the Spring 2016 Event. This mechanism enables the player to send out a squadron of Aircrafts to bomb the enemy before the actual Aerial Battle Phase. However they require you to pay attention to the Aircraft's "Range" which determines how far they all can get in the map they are deployed. Another thing is that they work just like CV(L)s, so you must take caution in the required Air Superiority in the node they are deployed to. Another special factor about this mechanism is that the <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">enemy landbase</span> may send out an Air Raid against yours to weaken it before it can actually fight. <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">You may defend your base by setting up one Land Base with all Fighters/Interceptors but due to RNG, it's not exactly a good defense mechanism.</span>
# '''Branching Rules''': You must follow specific requirements in Fleet Composition in order to head into a more simpler and better route in the Event Maps. This includes the '''Type of Ship''' (Ex. CAV, CL, SS, Akitsu Maru), and whether '''Slow or Fast Ships''' are included in your Fleet, along with how many of them you have in your fleet.
# '''Special Specific Ship(s) Branching Rules''': A mechanism introduced in the recent Events. Some of the Event maps follow the actual history in which ships have participated in the campaign referenced during the war. Using the ships that are in the game which have participated in the campaign historically had a special branching rule set upon them. When the Developers reveal what the Event will be referenced on, it is recommended to read the historical summaries behind the campaign referenced and see if any of the ships that currently exist in the Game have participated in the campaign. Using the ship(s) may lead the player to a better route in the Event (The special branching rule is mostly revealed after about 2~3 days after the Event starts).
#* '''Winter 2016 E-2''': Having Kasumi as flagship and the historical members of the Rei-Go Operation gave the best route for the map. Alternatives did exist but weren't as good as using the Historical Branching Route.
#* '''Spring 2016 E-7''': Having [[Akitsushima]] gave the player go through a bit more easier route at the end before the boss. This was not a historical branching however.
#* '''Summer 2016 E-3''': The map required having 7 of 11 specific ships to go down the shortest route.  
# '''Different starting points depending on type of fleet and/or type of ships used''': A new mechanism implemented in Winter 2016 Event, along with World 6-4. Depending on what type of Fleet and ships you are using, you start from a different starting point.

==What is the Difficulty Selection System?==
The Difficulty Selection System was a new system introduced in the Winter 2015 Event.

In the past, the Event difficulty was determined depending on your HQ Level. Because of this, many Admirals have tried to sustain their HQ Level at low levels and not have them be raised as much as possible so that they can avoid the Hard difficulty of the Event.

Now the Event will let you choose your difficulty. Except the more harder difficulties are only available to Admirals with high HQ level.
{| border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="article-table" style="width: 500px;"
|-
! scope="col" style="text-align: center;"|Click the option in the Red Circle to change your difficulty

|-

[[File:KanColle-150207-20351201.png|center|thumb]]
|[[File:Winter_Difficulty_Settings.png|center|thumb]]
|}
The Event will have 3 ranks: '''Easy''' (丙), '''Medium''' (乙), '''Hard''' (甲).
* HQ Level 35 unlocks Medium, HQ Level 80 unlocks Hard.
** You can choose the difficulty in each map separately.
** Different difficulties give different medals, equipment and materials when clearing the maps.
*** This was not the case in the past as rewards were the same for all difficulties.
** '''Ships rewards will appear regardless of the difficulty.'''
** Difficulties ''probably'' affect drop rates, but most drops are possible on any difficulty.
** When the difficulty is changed, '''the boss's health bar will be reset'''.
** Once the map is cleared (boss HP bar or TP bar is depleted and destroyed), '''<span style="color:red">You CANNOT change the difficulty of that map!</span>'''
** The First Class Medal symbol (the one that appears beside your name in your Admiral page) is given, along with the medal item (the one in your inventory) the moment you clear the final map on hard, '''regardless of the difficulties chosen for previous maps'''.
* It is highly advised that if a ship you would like to obtain is available in Easy mode of the map, you should spam the map in Easy mode to have an easier time doing the map while not putting too much strain on your resources. When the Boss Health Bar is near its end, reset the difficulty (Ex. Easy to Medium then back to Easy immediately) to continue if you still have not finished.
*You will not be able to jump up the difficulty from Easy -> Hard after a map. To be able to use "Hard" setting, you must clear the previous map either on Medium or Hard itself. Only ''jumping up two difficulty levels'' is not allowed, other combinations stick to the old rules'''<span style="color:red"> </span>'''
**【<span style="color:#f00;">BAD</span>】'''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' (''not possible because easy jumped to hard'')
**【OK】'''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>'''
**【OK】'''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>'''

**【OK】'''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>'''
=== '''<span style="color:red">PLAYERS BEWARE: </span>'''Some Drops will not be available in the lower difficulties===
'''<span style="color:red"><u>WARNING</u>: </span>'''During Winter 2015, Spring 2015 Event, and Summer 2015 Event, some ships were revealed to be only available as drops in '''Medium and Hard difficulty''', or just Hard difficulty alone, and were '''100% NOT Available in Easy difficulty'''. This should be taken into consideration if you plan on farming some ships from the Event Maps.

I am truly sorry to say that for '''Admirals below Level 80 HQ''', since you cannot access Hard difficulty, you may have to give up on getting a ship drop from the Event if she is revealed to be only available on Hard difficulty. If she is available in Medium also, then even if you don't want to do Medium since it is hard for you, if you really want the ship badly, you might as well try..

Another thing discovered within the past few Events was that in Easy mode, certain ships don't drop if you face against a specific enemy fleet.
*'''Fall 2015 E-4 Easy''': Prinz Eugen did not drop if you faced against an enemy fleet pattern in Diamond Formation with standard Wa-class Transport Ships
*'''Winter 2016 E-3 Easy''': Graf Zeppelin did not drop if you faced against an enemy fleet pattern that contains the standard Wa-class Transport Ships in the node where she drops.
*'''Summer 2016 E-2 Easy''': Prinz Eugen, Akitsushima, and Mizuho did not drop in Easy mode if you faced against certain enemy patterns. 

== Preparations for the Event #1: Resources==


===Prepare as much as Resources as possible!===
This is the most basic of the basics when it comes to preparing for Events.
<div style="background-color: #FFE0B2">
It is strongly advised that you prepare at least the following minimum amount of resources to prepare for the Event:
====Admirals who will be doing Easy mode straight all the way====
*'''Fuel''': At least 50,000
*'''Ammo''': At least 50,000
*'''Steel''': At least 40,000
*'''Bauxite''': At least 30,000 to 40,000
*'''Instant Repair Bucket''': At least 400 to 500+
====Admirals who will be doing Medium or Hard mode, or mix of both====
*'''Fuel''': At least 70,000
*'''Ammo''': At least 70,000
*'''Steel''': At least 70,000 to 100,000
*'''Bauxite''': At least 50,000
*'''Instant Repair Bucket''': At least 600+
The basis of the minimum resources stated above is that '''<span style="color:red">YOU WILL NOT BE RUSHING THROUGH THE EVENT</span>''' and will take things slowly and patiently throughout the Event period. If you plan on rushing through the Event, you will probably need a lot more than the stated above.
===='''Admirals who wish to rush through the Event + Farm the Maps for Drops in Medium / Hard:'''====
*'''Fuel''': At least 100,000 to 120,000
*'''Ammo''': At least 90,000 to 120,000
*'''Steel''': At least 80,000+
*'''Bauxite''': At least 70,000 to 90,000+
*'''Instant Repair Bucket''': About 700+
</div>

===Which Expeditions to do to gain these resources?===
This all depends on how much expeditions you have pulled through and I hope you have been diligently trying to unlock as much as Expeditions as possible. If not then now is the time to open up new Expeditions as soon as possible.

You should consider using the ships stated below in order to save resources even if they seem minor compared to standard consumption rates. In the long run it will save you a lot of resources, especially when more larger consumptions are involved (Ex. Expedition 37 and 38)
===='''Destroyer (DD)'''====
*[[Mutsuki Class|Mutsuki-class]] '''[Regular, Kai, and Kai Ni]''' (Lowest Ammo Consumption): Recommended for expeditions that has ammo consumptions.
*[[Kasumi]] '''[Kai Ni / Kai Ni B]''': Able to equip Daihatsu Landing Crafts. Able to boost up Expeditions she is in by equipping 3 copies of it. You may only have 4 maximum in a fleet.
*[[Verniy]]: Able to equip Daihatsu Landing Crafts. However Verniy has higher consumption than other Destroyers listed in this section, so unless you got no other options, you can consider using her for expeditions until you level the other Destroyer(s) for Expedition.
*[[Mutsuki Kai Ni]], [[Kisaragi Kai Ni]] and [[Satsuki Kai Ni]]: Able to equip Daihatsu Landing Crafts.
*[[Ooshio Kai Ni]]: Also able to equip Daihatsu Landing Crafts and in fact comes with one as stock equipment. However in her case, she requires a Blueprint to become Kai Ni.
*[[Kawakaze Kai Ni]] : Able to equip Daihatsu Landing Crafts.
<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">===='''Light Cruiser (CL)'''====</span>
<span style="background-color: #AED581">List is incomplete. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Tenryuu]] and [[Tatsuta]] '''[Non-Kai] '''(Lowest Ammo Consumption): Recommended for expeditions that requires CL.
*[[Yuubari]] '''[Non-Kai]''' (Lowest Fuel Consumption): Recommended for Expeditions that requires a CL and doesn't cost any ammo (Ex. Expedition 5 and 9)
*[[Abukuma |Abukuma Kai Ni]]: Allows use of 3 Daihatsu Landing Craft for 15% Extra Bonus in Resource Gain from expedition she participates in.
===='''If Expedition requires Aircraft Carrier (CV)'''====

*[[Houshou|Houshou ]](CVL) (Lowest Fuel and Ammo consumption): Recommended for Expeditions that require CV(L) (Ex. Expedition 15)
*[[Ryuuhou]] (CVL) '''[Non-Kai]''' (Low Fuel and Ammo consumption): Nearly same consumption as Houshou. Good to use for Expedition 15

*[[Chitose]] (AV) and [[Chiyoda]]''' '''(AV)''' [Non-Kai] '''(Lowest Fuel and Ammo Consumption)'''. '''Recommended for Expeditions that requires CV(L) or AV specifically. '''(Ex. Expedition 36 and 40)'''.
===='''Submarines (SS)'''====

*All non-remodeled Submarines except [[I-401]]. [[Maruyu]] should especially be considered to be used in Expeditions with the "'''Any Ships'''" option as they have very low fuel and ammo consumption (Ex. Expedition 2 and 6). You can choose to use SSVs for Expeditions that do not have any Ammo consumptions (Ex. Expedition 2, 5, 9, and 11)


===Maps to Farm for Resources===


====Orel Cruising (World 2-3)====

Great way to obtain''' Fuel and Ammo''', although it is mostly Fuel focused. The map has two nodes available majority of the time that will give you around 15 to 45 fuel per node. Recommended to use about 2 to 3 Submarines above level 20+ that are non-remodeled but maxed in stats via modernization. If you have [[U-511]] or [[Ro-500]] along with two [[New High Pressure-Temperature Steam Boiler]], she can solo the map to obtain resources, which is very profitable in terms of gain and loss. '''<span style="color:red">DO NOT USE SSV! </span>'''
====Bashi Island (World 2-2)====
Somewhat good way to obtain some extra '''Bauxite'''. Recommended to use 2 to 3 Submarines above level 20+ as well, but beware you may be led to node A, where there are some potential enemies in Echelon or Line Abreast Formation that can wreck your Submarines, forcing you to retreat.
===='''Kis Island (World 3-2)'''====
Good way to obtain to 50 to 150 '''Steel''' in node B. However somewhat risky as node A has [[Light Cruiser Ho-Class|Light Cruiser Ho-class Flagship]] or [[Destroyer Ro-Class|Destroyer Ro-class Flagship]] who are equipped with SONAR and Depth Charge, and due to the patch on January, '''you cannot gain the steel from node B unless you fight in node C''' (Which should be a piece of cake for Submarines).

===Getting more Resources: Sparkling===
Using a Sparkled Fleet for your Expedition gives the potential to gain 50%+ more resources than the default resource given. For players who wish to gain more resources than the normal amount, they should consider using a fully Sparkled fleet for more resource gain.

However please do mind that it is 50 percent Bonus, which means that if the original value of the resource given is low, then it might not be a good idea to use a sparkled fleet for that expedition (Ex. using a sparkled fleet for Expedition 2 isn't exactly a good idea as the sparkled fleet's morale will deplete fast). 

However if you are desperate for resources and let's say you need Bauxite (Because it's practically one of the hardest resource to gain fast as compared to Fuel and Ammo), then using a Sparkled Fleet for Expedition #6 can be somewhat good if you are willing to sparkle the fleet quite a lot (120 bauxite per 40min).

[[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft]] (LC) is <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">obtainable from [[Akitsu Maru]], [[Ooshio Kai Ni]] and [[Abukuma]] Kai Ni as stock equipment</span>. Each equipped LC will net an additional 5% gain in resources from expeditions, up to 20%. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">If upgraded via Akashi's Improvement Arsenal, you can bypass the 20% limit.</span>

Total resource gain is multiplicative with great success bonus. Combined with great success bonus, the net resource gain is calculated as 50%+7.5% per LC. Thus the max resource bonus is an additional 80% with great success and 4 Landing Crafts.

Please know that upgrading them to the [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]] and any further will decrease their extra resource gain. Keep the regular ones at MAX and only upgrade them if you need to upgrade them to turn them into combat-type equipment.

==Preparations for the Event #2: Recommended Ships==
Although you could use standard ships or some Kai Ni Ships, some ships are highly recommended to be used in Events.
<span style="background-color: #AED581">Consider splitting ships based on how accessible they are and how fast they get their K2. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

==='''Destroyer (DD)'''===
<span style="background-color: #AED581">Consider splitting the DD list based on their role, i.e. tank carriers, ASW ships, etc. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

Destroyers are very important as about 3 to 4 of them will be required to be used in maps requiring Combined Fleet while they will be responsible for taking down the enemy boss during Night Battle. Also, having at least one DD with Anti-Air Cut-In setup is practically mandatory to avoid getting bombed by Enemy aircrafts.
*<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">[[Fubuki|Fubuki Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 70. Good AA stats among the DDs, high LoS, and solid stats. Remodel has rare equipment '''[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Type_94_Anti-Aircraft_Fire_Director Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]''', which is highly recommended as it is required to trigger [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Anti-Air_Cut-In Anti-Air Cut-In], which will help you quite a lot against enemy CVs.</span>
*[[Yuudachi|Yuudachi Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 55. Most Lowest Kai Ni Remodel Level. 1st Highest Firepower and 2nd highest Torpedo stats. Very effective in both Day Battle and especially Night Battle.
*[[Shimakaze|Shimakaze Kai]]: High Firepower and 1st Highest Torpedo stat. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">As good as Yuudachi Kai Ni in Day Battle and Night Battle.</span>
*[[Akatsuki|Akatsuki Kai Ni]]: Good Firepower and 3rd Highest Torpedo stats among the DDs, along with high LoS stats (Which is highly preferred in World 2-5). <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Comparable to Shimakaze in terms of stats.</span>
*[[Ayanami|Ayanami Kai Ni]]: 2nd Highest Firepower and 4th highest Luck. A bit weaker Yuudachi but with high Luck stats. She is extremely great to use in your fleet for Torpedo and Firepower.
*[[Yukikaze|Yukikaze Kai]]: Highest Luck in the game (60), solid Firepower and Torpedo stats. Extremely good at night battle thanks to consistent Cut-in attacks.
*<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">[[Hatsushimo|Hatsushimo Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 70. 2nd Highest Luck (53). Average Firepower and Torpedo stats, but good Anti-Air stats and gives [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Type_91_Anti-Aircraft_Fire_Director Type 91 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]. Good for AACI and Night Battles for Cut-in Attack.</span>
*[[Shigure|Shigure Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 60. 3rd Highest Luck (50). Very Versatile to be used for<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A"> both Anti-Air and </span>Night Battle Cut-In. Has great Firepower and Torpedo stats.
*[[Kasumi Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 75. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Currently the Destroyer with the most highest Kai Ni remodel level in the game.</span> Has very good Firepower, Torpedo and Luck stats and very recommended for Surface Battle similar to Yuudachi and Ayanami. Also able to equip Daihatsu Landing Crafts which makes her much preferred for Expeditions. Also able to equip [[Fleet Command Facility]] which means she can be a preferable flagship for the Transport Combined Fleet which uses mostly DDs and CLs in case you need to retreat a Heavily Damaged ship.<span style="background-color: #AED581">No mention of anti-installation capabilities. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Kasumi Kai Ni B]]: Remodel Level 88. Trades some of her surface-combat stats for Anti-Air. Able to use Anti-Air Cut-In without the use of a Anti-Aircraft Fire Director like Isuzu Kai Ni. She is also able to equip Large Radars which are normally for larger ships than Destroyers.  However one thing to mention is that her Anti-Air Cut-In proficiency is lower than Akizuki, Teruzuki and Maya Kai Ni. Only recommended if you do not have Akizuki and Teruzuki. Just like her Kai Ni variant, she can equip Daihatsu Landing Crafts.
*[[Akizuki]]: Has the highest Anti-Air stats (able to go up to 140 AA stats) in the entire game. Able to use Anti-Air Cut-In without a Anti-Aircraft Fire Director. '''<span style="color:red">However she is only available to players who were able to obtain her as a Reward or as a Drop in recent events.</span>'''
*[[Teruzuki]]: Akizuki's sister and has 2nd highest Anti-Air stats in the entire game. Able to use Anti-Air Cut-in without a Anti-Aircraft Fire Director. ''' <span style="color:red">However she is only available to players who have cleared Summer 2015 Event. </span> '''
*[[Hatsuzuki]]''': '''Akizuki and Teruzuki's sister ship. Was one of the easiest Akizuki-class Destroyer to obtain for majority of players (unless they were practically brand new to the game). Just as her name states, she functions exactly the same as her sisters, excluding the few stat differences.
*[[Satsuki Kai Ni]]''': '''<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">Currently the best Mutsuki-class Destroyer as she has the ability to trigger AACI with the use of a single 25mm Triple Autocannon Mount (Concentrated Deployment) with no other equipment requirement</span>, able to equip Daihatsu Landing Craft. Her stats are pretty same as most standard Destroyers but she does have some utilities available.<span style="background-color: #AED581">No mention of her high {{ASW}} stats? - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Kawakaze Kai Ni]] : Great stats, able to equip Daihatsu Landing Craft. Drops from World 2-5. 
*[[Ooshio Kai Ni]]''': '''Has great stats for a Destroyer, similar to Ayanami Kai Ni in terms of stats excluding Luck. Not really a high priority unless you already got Abukuma Kai Ni and want some free Daihatsu Landing Craft without going after Akitsumaru.<span style="background-color: #AED581">No mention of anti-installation capabilities. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Asashio Kai Ni D|Asashio Kai Ni]]: Has good stats for Night Battle. At lv85, she can convert to an Anti-Submarine based Destroyer with high ASW stats. Not really a priority, but if you do like her, she is an option you could go for. <span style="background-color: #AED581"> It deserves the mention that her base K2 has one of the highest night firepower of the DDs in the game. Her K2D form has high {{ASW}} instead, but her firepower is decreased by a lot. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]] </span>
<span style="background-color: #AED581">Where's {{ShipLink|Arashio/Kai Ni|text=Arashio}} on the list? Where is {{ShipLink|Верный}}? The list is incomplete. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

===Light Cruiser (CL)===
'''Please be advised that some Event Maps will have Branching Rules to have 1-2 CLs to be in your fleet for you to go to a more easier route in the map.'''
*[[Sendai |Sendai Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 60. Great stats. Gives you the full Night Battle Equipment Package.<div style="background-color: #FFE0B2">'''<span style="color:red">Highest priority to level!</span>'''</div>
*[[Naka|Naka Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 48. Lowest Kai Ni Remodel Level. Has very good stats.
*[[Jintsuu|Jintsuu Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 60. Highest Firepower and Torpedo stats out of all CLs.
*[[Isuzu|Isuzu Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 50. Loses the ability to use Artillery Spotting due to loss of Plane Slots. She still does have very high Anti-Submarine stats and Anti-Air. Also, due to the recent update, she becomes enabled to use Anti-Air Cut-In without needing to equip an Anti-Aircraft Fire Director like Akizuki and Teruzuki, but her equipment setup requirement isn't so good for normal combat. However if you are a beginner who just can't bring yourself to power level any other viable Anti-Air Cut-In purpose ships, Isuzu can be a good start for you to start using seldom level Anti-Air Cut-In against enemy CVs. On June 30th, she has also gained the ability to do "Pre-emptive ASW Strike" against enemy submarines before they even fire their Torpedoes. She can use this regardless of her ASW stats.
*[[Ooyodo|Ooyodo Kai]]: 4 Equipment slots. Very good Anti-Air stats, Highest LoS stat, and very versatile. However she has very low Torpedo stats (in fact she starts off with 0 Torpedo stats when Level 1), making her effectiveness in Night Battle a bit low than most Light Cruisers. <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">However she also has '''30 Luck''', which means she can be utilized to use a Night Battle Cut-In Attack.</span> '''She is currently known to drop in World 1-6.''' She also gives the Equipment:[[ Fleet Command Facility]] which enables you to retreat Heavy Damaged Ships + 1 Destroyer when Combined Fleet is involved, which will make your life easier when doing the Event.<div style="background-color: #FFE0B2">'''<span style="color:red">Highest priority to Obtain and level!</span>'''</div><span style="background-color: #AED581">Lack of mentions on her being an excellent anti-installation ship. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Kuma|Kuma Kai]]: High Firepower and Torpedo stats. As good as Kai Ni Sendai-class ships. Alternative for players who do not have the time to raise Sendai-class to Kai Ni.
*[[Nagara]] and [[Natori]] Kai: High Firepower and Torpedo stats. Equivalent to Kuma in stats. As good as Kai Ni Sendai-class ships. Alternative for players who do not have the time to raise Sendai-class to Kai Ni. <span style="background-color: #AED581">It's the other way around. Kuma and Nagara have higher stats than Sendai K2 at already level 20. This is a matter of prioritizing low cost high return before anything else. Natori has lower armor stats. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Yuubari|Yuubari Kai]]: Not exactly the best CL you would use due to her low armor and HP along with Evasion, also the fact she cannot even utilize Artillery Spotting as she has 0 Plane Slot stats. However she is very useful if you don't really have any other CLs and require some diversity. She is mostly used for<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2"> either Anti-Air Cut-In,</span> Anti-Submarine<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">, or Night Battle</span> specifically.
*[[Abukuma|Abukuma Kai Ni]]: She is a CL who can equip the Daihatsu Landing Craft similar to AVs which means that you can practically equip her with 3 copies of them for Expeditions. Another fact is that she can equip Type A Ko-Hyoteki like CLTs, but she herself is '''NOT''' a CLT and still remains a CL. This can be put into a huge advantage when some maps do not allow you to bring CLTs (Ex. Summer 2015 Event E-6 and E-7). Abukuma however requires a Blueprint to become Kai Ni, but it is a very good investment and is considered '''<span style="color:red">Highest priority</span>''' to obtain as soon as possible.
<span style="background-color: #AED581">The list is incomplete. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

===Torpedo Cruiser (CLT):===
*[[Kitakami|Kitakami Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 50. Highest Torpedo stat in the entire game. Attacks with a preempetive torpedo strike by having [[Type A Ko-hyoteki|Type A Ko-Hyoteki]] equipped. Has 30 Luck <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A"> which means consistent Night Battle Cut-In attack</span> and even with Double Attack via two Main/Secondary Cannons, the damage is very deadly. '''<span style="color:red">Highest priority to level!</span>'''
*[[Ooi|Ooi Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 50. Equivalent to Kitakami Kai Ni except Ooi has low Luck, which means she is mostly good for Double Attack during Night Battle. Attacks with a preempetive torpedo strike by having [[Type A Ko-hyoteki|Type A Ko-Hyoteki]] equipped. Good to use along with Kitakami.<span style="background-color: #AED581">Ooi is just as high of a priority to level, together with Kitakami. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Kiso Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 65. Lower Torpedo stats than Kitakami and Ooi. Has more balanced stats. Usually used either when Ship-Locking is involved and you want to save your Kitakami and Ooi for later harder maps.

===Heavy Cruiser (CA)===
*[[Maya|Maya Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 75. 2nd highest Anti-Air stats in the game. Comes with '''[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Type_94_Anti-Aircraft_Fire_Director Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director], '''enabling Anti-Air Cut-In. She can use Anti-Air Cut-In with [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/25mm_Triple_Autocannon_Mount_%28Concentrated_Deployment%29 25mm Triple Autocannon Mount (Concentrated Deployment)], High-Angle Secondary Gun (Ex. [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount]]), and an[[List of Radars by stats| AIR RADAR]]. '''<span style="color:red">High priority to level!</span> '''
*[[Choukai|Choukai Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 65. Currently the CA with the highest Firepower. Comes with very good stock equipments such as [[Skilled Lookouts]], which increases Cut-in Attack rate during Night Battle, and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Type_22_Surface_RADAR_Kai_4 Type 22 Surface RADAR Kai 4], which is an extremely rare Radar that can be used on Destroyers. '''<span style="color:red">However she requires a Blueprint to become Kai Ni.</span>'''
*[[Myoukou]],[[ Haguro]], [[Nachi]], [[Ashigara]] Kai Ni: The most elite CAs in the game. They all have extremely good stats. Highly recommended to use any of the 4.
*<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">[[Aoba Kai]]: She is the only common CA to have high luck next to Myoukou Kai Ni. She was considered a good asset in Summer 2015 Event for Admirals who lacked Prinz Eugen as Aoba was able to have somewhat good trigger rate of using Torpedo Night Cut-In Attack in E-7 Boss. For Admirals who are lacking Prinz Eugen, it is recommended to have her ready just in case something similar to the last event occurs where you need several consistent Night Battle Torpedo Cut-in Ships</span>
*[[Zara]] & [[Pola Kai]]: Italian CAs who are unfortunately ineffective in regular Night Battle due to having low Torpedo Stats. However they are highly recommended to use instead of other CAs if you are up against Landbase Bosses as Anti-Landbase Warfare do not take Torpedo stats into consideration<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">. </span>Only firepower. You are able to save your more important CAs for other maps in case of Ship Locking and use either or both of these Italian CAs instead. Another feature they both have is that they are able to equip Seaplane Bombers and Seaplane Fighters. They aren't really recommended to equip Seaplane Bombers as they only got (2) plane slots. But they are good to use Seaplane Fighters if extra Air Superiority is needed (please know they can't trigger Artillery Spotting for themselves in this case unless you have a Recon Seaplane or Seaplane Bomber along with the Seaplane Fighter together).
*[[Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen Kai]]: Has the highest Luck out of all CAs which means she is viable to use consistent Night Battle Cut-In Attack. Great Stats also and has the highest HP out of all CAs. ''' <span style="color:red">However she is only available to players who have cleared Fall 2014 Event and lucky enough to obtain her as a Drop.</span>'''
===Aviation Cruiser (CAV)===
Required majority of the time for Branching Rules for Event Maps and especially when used in maps that require [[Combined Fleet]] that will lead you to a more easier and simple route in the Map. '''Usually 2 CAVs are required.''' <span style="background-color: #AED581">CAV become especially important when you need to establish air superiority, but you cannot use carriers for whatever reasons. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Tone]] and [[Chikuma]] Kai Ni: Remodel Level 70. Highest LoS stats, great Firepower, Torpedo and Anti-Air stats. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Very good to use when Effective Line of Sight mechanism is involved in the Maps and it has a high requirement.</span> However both requires a Blueprint to become Kai Ni. <span style="background-color: #AED581">Base LoS stats is actually the least relevant stat when it comes to deciding whether you should use them or not. Also, they're the strongest CAVs in the game. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Mogami_Class Mogami-class Kai]: Alternative to using Tone and Chikuma Kai Ni if you are unable to level Tone and Chikuma or remodel them to Kai Ni. Moderate stats but low resource consumption rate. [[Mogami]] has Level 10 Remodel Level while [[Mikuma]] has Level 30 Remodel Level. [[Suzuya]] and [[Kumano]] both have Level 35 Remodel level. They have also recently received some buff which increased their Plane Slots so that they can equip more Seaplanes.

===Battleship (BB)===
*[[Kirishima|Kirishima Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 75. 4th Highest Firepower out of the entire Battleship-class, even higher than Nagato-class.
*[[Haruna|Haruna Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 80. Has the highest Luck out of all Battleships<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">, giving you the option to use Night Battle Cut-In Attack with 3 Main Cannons</span>. Also has <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">the</span> high Evasion stats.
*[[Kongou]] and [[Hiei ]]Kai Ni Remodel Level 75 for both. They are recommended to have in your fleet, as they are balanced Fast Battleships which will help you.
*[[Bismarck|Bismarck Drei]]: Has Torpedo stats, increasing her battle capability in Night Battle. ''' <span style="color:red">However she is only available by LSC and requires 2 Blueprints to reach Drei.</span> '''
*[[Yamato]] & [[Musashi]]: Strongest Battleship of the entire game in Firepower and Armor. ''' <span style="color:red">However they are only available by LSC and they have very high resource consumption rate. </span>'''They aren't really required in order clear the Event, although they are more sturdy compared to the other Battleships, giving them higher survivability, along with the fact they will be one of the power houses to kill bosses with their high-caliber attacks. They are also now able to equip Seaplane Fighters.
*[[Nagato]] & [[Mutsu]]: Standard Battleships that are very good to use for all players. If you have them, consider using them as they are bit more sturdy and have very high Firepower. One of the things special about them is that they gain accuracy bonuses from using [[41cm Twin Gun Mount]]. They are also now able to equip <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">Seaplane Bombers and</span> Seaplane Fighters.
*[[Italia]] & [[Roma]]: New Italian Fast Battleships given as reward and drop respectively (Inb4 Roma doesn't exist) during the Spring 2015 Event. They are very excellent ships, more powerful than the Kongou-class and Nagato-class in Firepower and having Long-range like Yamato-class. <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">Don't be fooled because their Italian [[381mm/50 Triple Gun Mount Kai|381mm guns]] have -1 or -3 Accuracy stats. That's only the case if equipped on other ships, but if equipped on Italia and Roma respectively, that's when their true potential comes out thanks to equipment fitting bonus. More better if upgraded via [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal|Akashi's Improvement Arsenal. ]]</span>The downside to these two is the fact their Remodel costs a Blueprint. If you have obtained one or both of them, you should consider using them next Event. They are also now able to equip Seaplane Bombers and Seaplane Fighters.
*[[Iowa Kai]]: The Reward Ship from Spring 2016 E-7 and the first American Ship to be added into this game. Currently so far she is the most powerful Fast Battleship in the entire game. However she is also quite expensive, only a bit less expensive compared to Yamato-class but expensive than regular BB and Italia/Roma. Her stock equipment are also top-class that you can utilize on other ships as well.
*[[Warspite Kai]] : Cheap resource consumption for a Battleship. Her stats however are somewhat low and similar to Italia/Roma excluding her high Luck. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Good for early stages of Events in case of Ship Locking, but not exactly too recommended for Final Operations.</span>  '''<span style="color:red">She is only available if you cleared E-4 in Summer 2016 Event.</span>'''
===Aviation Battleship (BBV)===
They are considered '''Slow Battleships''', so for players who do not own Nagato nor Mutsu, they may consider using BBVs instead to fill that requirement, especially when a Branching Rule requires Slow Battleships to be included in the fleet. Also they add a bit of Air Superiority to support CVs.<span style="background-color: #AED581">BBV are less commonly used for establishing air superiority, but the option is definitely available. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Fusou]] / [[Yamashiro|Yamashiro Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 80. They have great Firepower stats as good as Kai Ni Kongou-class and Nagato-class. They have a '''(23) Aircraft Slot''' on their 4th Equipment Slot which can support Air Superiority Power by equipping them with your best Seaplane Bomber with high Anti-Air stats. '''<span style="color:red">However they require Blueprint to become Kai Ni. </span>'''
*[[Ise]]/[[Hyuuga]] Kai: Mostly the Beginner's Battleship, so I am sure you have used either of them a lot during your starting days. They are only recommended if you really have no choice because you lack the other Battleships mentioned beforehand. Otherwise you may considering using either of the two if Ship Locking happens as it is more recommended to save your important ships for later maps. Beware Ise and Hyuuga's Firepower is very low (They have practically the same amount of base Firepower as Heavy Cruisers).
===Aircraft Carrier (CV)===

It is worth noting that if you use the '''Surface Task Force''' '''(水上部隊)''' option in[[ Combined Fleet]], '''you may only use 1 CV. '''If you use The '''Carrier Task Force (機動部隊)''' option, then '''you may bring up to 4 CV'''. This is important as gaining Air Superiority will be important in the Event as there will most likely be [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class|Wo-class Kai Flagship]] and maybe even [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] or [[Aircraft Carrier Demon|Demon]] (last 2 previous Event always had her appearing either as Semi-Boss or Boss itself), where you will most likely require high Air Superiority power if you want to enable [[Artillery Spotting]] Effects for your fleet. However beware that Carrier Task Force option makes your 2nd Fleet which consists mostly of CL, CLT, DDs attack first.
*[[Kaga]] Kai: <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">1st best CV in the entire game in terms of HP and Air Superiority power.</span> She is highly recommended to level and to be used in the Event.<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A"> Recommended to use 3 [[Reppuu]] + 1 Bomber during Events.</span>
*[[Akagi]] <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">Kai: 3rd best CV in the entire game in terms of HP and Air Superiority Power.</span> She is obtainable from Quest B10. It is highly advised for players who did not do the Quest to do it immediately and power level her to Kai and max her stats via Modernization. <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">Recommended to use 3 Reppuu + 1 Bomber during Events.</span>
*[[Taihou]] Kai: <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">2nd best CV in the entire game in terms of Air Superiority Power.</span> She also has the special ability to attack even while in Moderate Damage which the other CVs cannot do. '''<span style="color:red">However she is only available by LSC.</span>'''
*[[Hiryuu]] and [[Souryuu]] Kai Ni: Kai Ni Remodel Level 77 and 78 respectively. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Not exactly the best CVs in terms of Air superiority power as they have somewhat unbalanced set of Plane slots.</span> However they give you extremely good stock equipments which makes them worth leveling up to Kai Ni. They also have the best Firepower,<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A"> Anti-Air,</span> and Evasion stats compared to other CVs,<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2"> which makes them shine as '''Bombers''' than used for Air Superiority purposes.</span>
*[[Unryuu]] /[[Amagi]] /[[Katsuragi]] Kai: Has low stats as a CV but cheap resource consumption and comes with excellent Aircraft stock equipment. Not a priority but if you wish to increase your team of CVs, they are an option to go for.
*[[Shoukaku Kai Ni]]: Her 1st to 3rd Plane Slots have increased by 3+, her Firepower is also extremely high, and her range has increased. She is practically the best CV this game can offer. However you require the [[Prototype Flight Deck Catapult]] from either Summer 2015 Event E-6 Medium and above, or from the new line of Quests that were released in a previous update. You may convert her to a CVB at Lv 88, but that is your choice.
*[[Shoukaku Kai Ni A]]: A conversion at Level 88 which turns Shoukaku into a CVB (Armored Aircraft Carrier). This decreases her plane slots and makes them unbalanced. However just like Taihou, she gains the ability to launch planes even at Medium-Damage. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">It is also stated that she will be able to use a new generation of aircraft: Jets, in a later update.</span>
*[[Zuikaku Kai Ni]]: Her plane slots are a bit different than her sister Shoukaku but still high class CV, best of the best. Her stats are very similar to her sister Shoukaku. However you require the [[Prototype Flight Deck Catapult]], which must be obtained from the new Quests, unless you saved the copy from Summer 2015 Event for Zuikaku herself.
*[[Zuikaku Kai Ni A]]: A conversion at Level 90 which turns Zuikaku into a CVB (Armored Aircraft Carrier). This decreases her Plane slots and makes them unbalanced similarly to Hiryuu-class Kai Ni and Unryuu-class. However like Taihou and Shoukaku Kai Ni A, she can attack even in Medium Damage. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">It is also stated that she will be able to use a new generation of aircraft: Jet-based aircraft in a future update.</span>
*[[Graf Zeppelin Kai]]: First German CV. She is able to attack during Night Battle using guns (Not Planes). Her Plane Slots are unfortunately not that good.<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A"> If extremely required, then you can equip her with 2 Secondary Guns with high Firepower and Torpedo Bombers to have her do Double Attack in Night Battle with somewhat seldom Night Battle stats.. Somewhat capable to take down small ships such as enemy DD, CL, and CVLs during Night Battle. However she is not very effective against heavier ships in Night Battle.</span> '''<span style="color:red">However she is only available if you were able to obtain her from Fall 2015 Event E-4 and Winter 2016 Event E-3. </span>'''

<span style="background-color: #AED581">Just flat out state that the night battle capabilities of carriers are complete garbage, as their low stats combined with the usage of the regular shelling formula makes this a silly option. There is never a situation where you would ever want to rely on the night battle capabilities of a carrier, over them just simply using planes for dominance during the day. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

<span style="background-color: #AED581">{{ShipLink|Saratoga/Kai|text=Saratoga}} is missing on the list. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
===Light Aircraft Carrier (CVL)===

It is worth noting that if you use the '''Surface Task Force''' '''(水上部隊)''' option in[[ Combined Fleet]], '''you may only use 2 CVL.''' If you want to use this option while having Air Superiority Power, then CVLs will become important factors.
*[[Junyou|Junyou Kai Ni]]: Remodel Level 80. Best CVL in the game at the current time. Has balanced Plane Slots which enables good Air Superiority power. Also gives you a free [[Reppuu]]. Also has highest Firepower, Anti-air, Armor and Evasion stats. <span style="background-color: #AED581">Lack of mention that she has slow speed. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*[[Chitose]] and [[Chiyoda]] Kai Ni: Remodel Level 50 for both. Very Balanced Plane slots, making them have good Air superiority power. They also have the highest HP out of all CVLs. Their stats are as good as Junyou Kai Ni. One thing to note is that they are considered "<u>'''Fast Ships'''</u>", which may be an important factor in the Branching Rules.

<span style="background-color: #AED581">List is too short. Missing ships like {{ShipLink|Hiyou/Kai|text=Hiyou}} and {{ShipLink|Ryuujou/Kai Ni|text=Ryuujou}}. As there's not that many light carriers, just list all of them and state their pros and cons. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

===Submarine (SS/SSV)===
The last Event in [[Winter 2015 Event|Winter 2015]] had a Branching Rule that involved players using a Submarine in E-5 for a better route in the Map, also the fact one of the bosses there, the [[Light Cruiser Demon]], was in fact a CL, making the use of Submarine in your 2nd Fleet very viable so that your other ally ships would have an easier time while the boss herself attacked the Submarine all the time ([http://i.imgur.com/WlMIH7y.jpg LOL]). It is always possible that use of Submarines may be involved again in the upcoming Event due to Branching Rules or maybe because of a Boss. However due to the fact majority of the enemies in the Event are Flagship-level DD/CLs, [[Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|Tsu-class]], along with Late Model Enemy DDs equipped with both SONAR and Depth Charge, using Submarines are very risky as they will be prone to getting Heavily Damaged easily by the enemies with ASW equipments.

<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">
There are only two Submarines that are worth using in the Event in case they are required:</span>
*[[U-511]] / [[Ro-500 |Ro-500: ]]Highest Evasion Stats out of all Submarines. Ro-500's potential full Evasion especially is 93 by the use of two [[New High Pressure-Temperature Steam Boiler]] which may increase her survivability although it is still not guaranteed. Also the fact Ro-500 has the 2nd highest Luck out of all Submarines while even U-511 herself has the 3rd highest Luck. Using either forms should be considered. ''' <span style="color:red">However they are only available for players who have cleared E-3 from Winter 2015 Event and those who got U-511 from Spring 2015 Event E-6 and Summer 2015 Event E-5 as a Drop.</span> '''
*[[I-58]] (SSV): She was actually used the most in E-3 and E-5 of the Spring 2015 Event for those who preferred to bring a Submarine due to the Boss and the Branching Rules. She herself has the highest Luck of all Submarines, letting her do consistent cut-in attacks during night battle. She should be considered to be used by players who do not own U-511/Ro-500.

<span style="background-color: #AED581">While some subs are definitely better than others, their torpedo stats are all generally nearly the same. The list also fails to explain the importance of SSV. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

===Seaplane Tenders (AV)===
Although previous Events didn't exactly require players to use them, strangely enough the Developers have started releasing some new contents for the AVs (Ex. Akitsushima, World 6-3). It is recommended to prepare at least 1 just in case as no one knows what the Developers might come up with.
*[[Chitose]]/[[Chiyoda]] AV: Pretty much your standard AV that you will be using if required. Their standard equipment setup is 2 Seaplane <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Bombers (Zuiun type 12, Prototype Seiran) and Type A Ko-Hyoteki.</span> Even outside battles, they have their uses thanks to being able to equip Akitsumaru's Daihatsu Landing Crafts
*[[Mizuho]]: New Ship from Summer 2015 Event. Has higher Plane capacity compared to Chitose/Chiyoda. Combat-wise, she is a bit more higher than them. She has been available in several Events and now is available in World 5-3 Boss Node. 
*[[Akitsushima]]: Not exactly the AV you would want to use because her Plane capacity is only ( 1 ) per equipment slot, which<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A"> means she isn't good for extra air superiority</span> nor does her planes last long if shot down during Aerial Combat phase. Also the fact unlike Chitose/Chiyoda, she cannot equip Type A Ko-Hyoteki <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">nor can she use Daihatsu Landing Crafts</span>. Her good point however is that she can equip the [[Type 2 Large-sized Flying Boat]], which is known for its high Contact trigger rate and high LoS,<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2"> and she can equip both SONAR + Depth charge, making her more useful in Anti-Submarine warfare</span> (However unlike DD/CLs, she must equip a Seaplane Bomber or else she cannot attack submarines). She is also good in equipping multiple Seaplane Fighters as they do not get shot down during Air Battle phase.
===[[Akitsu Maru|Akitsu Maru (LHA)]]===
Akitsu Maru has been required for some branching rules in the Event Maps to go to a more simpler and easier route for several past Events. If you have her, it is highly recommended that you train her up to Kai and maximize her stats via Modernization. You never know when you might need her for to follow Branching Rules in the Event maps. She can also equip 3 [[Reppuu]] or other Fighter Planes which can help you gain more Air Superiority. She was practically one of the main keys in completing the Summer 2015 Event as she took the players to a consistent route while using the Surface Task Force Combined Fleet. Players who did not have her had to suffer at the mercy of RNG by going to the wrong route several times. Don't let this happen to you.
==Preparations for the Event #3: Preparing your Equipments==
Other than standard equipments you may obtain from majority of ships, some equipments are mandatory to be prepared to increase your success in clearing the map.
===Night Battle Equipment===
As stated before, the full package is available to you if you level [[Sendai]] to Kai Ni. The Night Battle Equipments are crucial to your success especially when Combined Fleet is involved, as your <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">CA, CL(T), DDs and 1 FBB</span> will be responsible in taking down the Enemy Boss (which will most likely be a Demon or Princess with an insane amount of Armor).

'''<span style="color:red">In Combined Fleet, the Night Battle Equipments must be equipped on the ships in the <u>2nd Fleet</u> for the equipments to take effect during Night Battle!</span>'''
*[[Searchlight]] {{Searchlight}}[[Star Shell]] {{StarShell}}
** During Night Battle, used to support fleet's shelling.
** Fleet's accuracy rate and cut-in rate increases while enemy fleet's cut-in rate decreases.
** But, ship equipped with the searchlight is more likely to be targeted and hit by enemy ships.
** Star Shell does not have demerits when triggered<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2"> but has lower chance of triggering.</span><span style="background-color: #AED581">Implying that searchlight trigger isn't always 100%. The only time the searchlight doesn't trigger, is if the ship equipping it only has 1 {{HP}} left. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
** Searchlight can be equipped by Destroyer, Light Cruiser, Heavy Cruiser, Aviation Cruiser, Seaplane Tender, Battleship and Aviation Battleship.
** Star Shell can be equipped by the ships stated above, Torpedo Cruiser, Repair Ship and Submarine Tender.
* [[Type 98 Recon Seaplane (Night Scout)|Night Reconnaissance Seaplane (Night Scout)]] {{Seaplane}}
** Similar to Recon Seaplane, but has additional effects during night battle.
** Can trigger Night Contact which boosts your ships' attacks and critical rate. <span style="background-color: #AED581">It also raises the accuracy of your fleet. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
*** <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Similar to Contact, Night Contact will trigger only with Air Superiority during the day, or if the battle begins at night.</span> <span style="background-color: #AED581">Inaccurate, because contact also works during AD. During PvP, it also works during AP. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
** Can trigger Artillery spotting during day battle but lower effect than normal recon planes.
* [[Skilled Lookouts ]]
**Surface Ship Personnel.
**[[Choukai|Choukai Kai Ni]] Stock Equipment.
**Increases <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">cut-in chance</span> and <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">critical hit chance</span> of''' the particular ship it's equipped with '''during Night Battle. <span style="background-color: #AED581">Bonus cut-in chances is in a form of {{Luck}} boost. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>
**<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">This equipment is optional.</span>

=== [[Fleet Command Facility]] {{CommandFacility}}===
Stock equipment of [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Ooyodo Ooyodo Kai]. [[File:Note.png|thumb|250px]] The [[Fleet Command Facility]] allows a Destroyer in the 2nd fleet of a [[Combined Fleet]] to escort a heavily damaged ship away from the sortie.

This equipment will most likely decrease the amount of times you will have to retreat from an Event Map when Combined Fleet is used.
* <u>'''<span style="color:red">Must be equipped by the Flagship of the 1st Fleet</span>'''</u> and needs a '''non-flagship DD not Heavy, Moderate, or Light damaged '''in the second fleet for it to give the option to escort the ship.
* The DD doing the escort will be the first to meet the requirements. Positioning most important DDs last (or flagship) is recommended.
* The screen will show up after [Results], and before the [Continue/Retreat] screen. The heavily damaged ship and another DD will show up, with green sentences. Left button will remove the damaged ship and a DD from combat and they will lose 25 morale. Right button will continue without escorting.
* You cannot escort fleet flagships (Either in first fleet or second fleet).
* Since the combined fleet mechanic only appears during events, the Fleet Command Facility currently has no use other than stats for the majority of gameplay.
* Escorted (and escorting) ships cannot participate in combat and cannot be targeted.
=== [[Type 91 Armor-Piercing (AP) Shell|Type 91]] / [[Type 1 Armor-Piercing (AP) Shell]]{{RedAmmo}}===
* Can be equipped by Battleship and Aviation Battleship. Increases firepower {{Firepower}}and accuracy.
* Affects artillery spotting cut-in, Does not affect night double attack/cut-in.
* When Armor Piercing Shell and Large Caliber Guns are equipped together, daytime shelling damage and accuracy are increased against enemies with thick armor and installation type bosses.
* Type 1 AP Shell has higher stats than Type 91 shell, but only 2 can be obtained from quest. As of the January 23rd update, more Type 1 shell can be obtained by upgrading through [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]].
* Highly recommended in order to take down the Boss with more effectiveness.
=== [[List of Anti-Submarine Equipment by stats|Depth Charge &amp; SONAR]] {{DepthCharge}}{{Sonar}} ===
Mandatory when <span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">Enemy Submarines are involved</span> or the Map itself is a Submarine map.
* Using 1 Depth Charge + 2 SONAR is required for maximum output against enemy submarines.
* In case of using [[Ooyodo|Ooyodo Kai]], [[Yuubari|Yuubari Kai]], or [[Katori|Katori Kai]] who has 4 Equipment slots, then it is recommended to use 1 Depth Charge + 3 SONAR.
** However they can also use 2 Main/Secondary Guns + 1 SONAR + 1 Depth Charge to be Surface Combat + Anti-Submarine Combat hybrids in case non-Submarine enemies are involved along with Enemy Submarines.
* If you do not have either of the two or lacking some, it is recommended to spam '''10/10/10/20''' recipe for SONARs and '''10/30/10/10''' for Depth Charges. '''10/30/10/31''' recipe works as a hybrid recipe for getting either of the two.

==== 12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director====
* Upgraded from Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director via Akashi's Improvement Arsenal.
* Enables Anti-Air Cut-in while equipped with AIR RADAR. Supplemented by Anti-Air Gun.
* Unlike the 10cm Twin High-angle variant, this one is a Secondary Gun, <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">making Double Attack being unavailable to the ship that equips it.</span> <span style="background-color: #AED581">Ambiguous.

==== 90mm Single High-angle Gun Mount====
* Available from [[Italia]] or [[Roma|Roma Kai]].
* Equivalent to the 12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director.
* Able to trigger Anti-Air Cut-In while equipped with AIR Radar. Supplemented by Anti-Air Gun
* Secondary Gun, only equipable to CLs and above.
* Viable to use for players who do not have the 12.7cm High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director.
* Able to be upgraded via Akashi's Improvement Arsenal, which means it's a better option than the 12.7cm+AAFD gun.
=== [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] {{GreenGunDP}}===

===Carrier-Based Aircrafts: Dive Bomber / Torpedo Bomber / Fighter Planes===
Players are recommended to try crafting some high-grade aircrafts for their CV and CVLs. They will increase the potential opening strike when they are required to be brought to the Event maps you are participating.
==== [[Reppuu]] / [[Shiden Kai 2|Shiden Kai Ni]]{{GreenPlane}}====
Practically one of the Best Fighter Planes (10+ AA / 9+ AA & +3 Evasion) respectively) in the game. <span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">At least 2-3 copies should be considered to be equipped on each of your CV(L) to gain Air Superiority against the enemy, especially when the Enemy has powerful CV such as [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] or [[Aircraft Carrier Demon|Demon]], who now appears quite frequently in the Event usually as a Semi-Boss</span>. If you don't have any, please try to craft them immediately through Development using the '''20/20/10/90''' recipe with a CV as Flagship.'''<span style="color:red"> HIGH PRIORITY TO OBTAIN!!!</span>'''
====[[Ryuusei Kai]] {{BluePlane}}====
Currently the best Torpedo Bomber you can craft via Development. If players do not have any good Torpedo Bombers, nor Souryuu/Hiryuu Kai Ni, then try to craft at least about 6 to 9 copies of this.
====[[Suisei (Comet) Model 12A]] {{RedPlane}}====
Currently the best Dive Bomber you can craft via Development. If players do not have any good Torpedo Bombers, nor Souryuu/Hiryuu Kai Ni, then try to craft some for assurance. Ryuusei Kai takes more priority though.

===[[Aircraft Proficiency]]===
{| border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="article-table" style="height: 100%; width: 300px;"
|-
| scope="col"|[[File:-Death_Usagi-_2015-10-20_17-58-03_87.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Aircraft Proficiency Example]]
|}
The Aircraft Proficiency System (tentative name) is a system introduced in the August 10th, 2015 update along with the Summer 2015 Event which enables planes to acquire experience in sorties. This system applies to all aircraft in the game with the exception of autogyros and Liason Aircraft.

By acquiring experience from '''repeated sorties''', pilots eventually gain ranks. As planes reach higher ranks, they acquire '''hidden''' stat bonuses that increase their overall effectiveness during battle.

Planes may lose their accumulated experience when they are shot down, which would downgrade their proficiency rank, or worse, strip them of their ranking emblems entirely. It is thus of imperative importance to send out your planes under the most favorable aerial situations whenever possible.

Fun Fact: Abyssal Planes DO NOT have aircraft proficiency.

For More Details please '''[[Aircraft Proficiency|CLICK HERE]]'''

===Anti-Landbase (Installation) Warfare Equipment===
Recently Anti-Landbase Warfare Equipment have become a higher priority due to the increase of new [[Installation Type|Installation Bosses]] in recent Events. The problem with this type of equipment is that they are quite difficult to obtain due to the availability and method of obtaining them. However without them, the player will have an extremely difficult time against Installation-type bosses in Events.

For more information on Installation enemies, '''[[Installation Type|CLICK HERE]]'''
==== [[Type 3 Shell]]{{GreenAmmo}} ====
Does increased damage against "Installation type" bosses such as [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Airfield_Princess Airfield Princess], [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Isolated_Island_Demon Isolated Island Demon], [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Northern_Princess Northern Princess], and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Midway_Princess Midway Princess]. This equipment should be highly considered to be developed during your Daily Development Quests in case an Installation-type Boss or Sub-Boss is included in the Event. Spring 2015 Event and World 4-5 should have taught us a lot about the usage of Type 3 Shell.

This equipment is the most common equipment to use against Installation-type Bosses but is only available to use for CA(V)s and BB(V)s.

<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">One thing to take note of however is that this equipment is not effective against a certain Installation Type enemy known as the [[Artillery Imp]].</span>

<span style="background-color: #AED581">Installation weaknesses is more complex than that. T3 shells deals a standard 2.5x multiplier against '''soft''' installations. Some hybrid installations are more resistant to it, like the {{ShipLink|Isolated Island Princess}} and others are complete immune to them, like the {{ShipLink|Central Princess - Damaged|Central Princess}}, dealing no extra damage. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

====Daihatsu Landing Crafts====
Daihatsu has recently debuted as an equipment effective against certain types of [[Installation Type|Installation-type]] enemies. Daihatsu is only effective against Artillery Imps and certain Installation bosses such as Supply Depot Princess and Isolated Island Princess. This equipment is not effective against "Soft-skinned" Installation who only take bonus damage from WG42 and Type 3 Shell (Ex. Northern Ocean Princess, Harbor Princess, and Airfield Princess).

There are three types of them available:<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">[[Daihatsu Landing Craft|Daihatsu Landing Craft]]</span>
*Daihatsu Landing Craft
*[[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]]
*[[Special Type 2 Amphibious Landing Craft]]
This equipment is only available to use on certain Destroyers (Ex. Kasumi K2, Ooshio K2, Kawakaze K2) AND Light Cruiser (Abukuma K2), and Seaplane Tenders, along with Akitsumaru.

The Special Type 2 Amphibious Landing Craft however is only available to equip on certain Destroyers instead of all those who can equip Daihatsu Landing Craft.

{{Hard Anti-installation Weapons}}
====[[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]]====
This equipment is effective against all types of Installation enemies. However the major issue with this equipment is that it is only available to obtain from U-511, who is only available as a Drop in Events.

This equipment is more effective if you can equip two copies on one ship. Most effective ships to use it with are 4-slotted CLs such as Ooyodo Kai and Yuubari Kai, along with CAVs.

Available to use on all DD, CL, and CAV (Not regular CA), along with Seaplane Tender.

<span style="background-color: #AED581">While this equipment is indeed effective on all kind of installations, you can also receive both a flat and a multiplier bonus depending on what kind of installation you're fighting. This multiplier bonus can either be pre-cap or post-cap. - [[User:Tsubakura|Tsubakura]]</span>

===[[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]]===
This system is made for [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Akashi Akashi] and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Akashi Akashi Kai]. If you have her as your secretary ship, you will be able to use Akashi's Improvement Arsenal.

By using Improvement Material (AKA Screws), Development Material and Resources, equipment can be improved and upgraded into a better equipment. Equipment that can be improved depends on the day of the week and the ship in the second slot.

<span style="background-color: #FFE0B2">Generally, it is known that main guns which get up to 9+ ★ will have increased Firepower and Accuracy.</span>

Unless for collection purposes, it is NOT recommended to convert an equipment by upgrading a 10+ MAX ★ equipment, unless the converted equipment also has upgrades to 10 Max ★ available (Ex. [[15.2cm Twin Gun Mount Kai]] has upgrades available even after being converted from the [[15.2cm Twin Gun Mount]] 10 MAX ★), or if it converts to an equipment for equipment combination purposes (Ex. Upgrading a 10 MAX ★ [[Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] into [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director for]] Anti-Air Cut-In purposes)

<span style="background-color: #EF9A9A">(Example: A 9+ ★ [[35.6cm Twin Gun Mount]] will have much better Firepower and Accuracy compared to a standard [[Prototype 35.6cm Triple Gun Mount]], which can't be upgraded via Akashi's Improvement Arsenal)</span>

==Preparations for the Event #4: Correct Equipment Setups==
It has come to my attention that some newer Admirals are still not familiar with the proper equipment setups that are supposed to be used not only in regular runs, but also in Events. The following section will show Equipment setups that are practically mandatory to use in everyday runs and specifically in Events. If possible, don't use Equipment setup outside the ones that are shown below.
===Battleship (BB) / Fast Battleship (FBB) / Aviation Battleship (BBV)===
When against a [[Battleship Water Demon|Demon]] or [[Battleship Princess|Princess]] Boss, using '''Mixed Attack (Armor-Pierce)''' should be considered to deal more damage against them as they have an insane amount of armor that is very difficult to penetrate. In Combined Fleet, the Battleships' role is to deal heavy damage against the Boss and their supporting ships, so that the 2nd Fleet composed of CA, CL(T), and DD (0-2 Fast Battleships may also be added into the 2nd Fleet but this depends on Branching Rules) has more easier time finishing the boss off.

'''Double Attack (Anti-Installation-type) '''is only required if the Event has a Land Base Boss such as [[Northern Princess]], [[Midway Princess]], and [[Airfield Princess]]. Otherwise it is practically ignored.

===Combined Fleet: Fast Battleship (FBB) in 2nd Fleet===
If you are planning to use a Fast Battleship in the 2nd Fleet, there are only two ships that are highly recommended to use:[[Haruna| Haruna Kai Ni]] and [[Bismarck|Bismarck Drei]]. Haruna Kai Ni has 41 Luck, enabling consistent Night Battle Cut-In Attack, while Bismarck Drei has Torpedo stats which means she can do a very powerful attack during Night Battle. You may just consider using a Kongou-class Fast Battleship with the standard Double Attack setup, but beware because Battleships lack Torpedo stats, sometimes their damage output in Night Battle tends to be low.

==='''<span style="color:red">PLAYERS BEWARE: Overweight Gun Penalty </span>'''===
This was introduced in the 2014/07/28 Update, where if a Battleship had too much heavy caliber guns that is actually over their capacity equipped on them, they would lose accuracy. This is '''VERY IMPORTANT''', as when Combined Fleet is used, both sides will suffer some accuracy issues where your ships will have issues actually hitting the enemy. For more details, please '''[[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|CLICK HERE]]'''

It is highly recommended that you avoid using the [[46cm Triple Gun Mount ]]on '''Fast Battleships''' and stick with [[35.6cm Twin Gun Mount]] ([[Prototype 35.6cm Triple Gun Mount|Prototype]] ones included) or [[41cm Twin Gun Mount]] ([[Prototype 41cm Triple Cannon|Prototype]] included) on them. Just let Yamato-class use the 46cm Triple Gun Mount. It is in fact recommended to try avoiding to have Nagato-class use 46cm Triple Gun Mount if possible and use 41cm Twin Gun Mount instead, just to increase the accuracy potential.

===Heavy Cruiser (CA) / Aviation Cruiser (CAV)===
Heavy Cruiser or Aviation Cruiser are available to be added in both 1st and 2nd Fleet, depending on the Branching Rules. It should be mentioned that a Heavy Cruiser in the 2nd fleet will be practically responsible in taking down the Boss during Night Battle in Combined Fleet along with the DDs and CLs. Also, it is recommended that a Heavy Cruiser or Aviation Cruiser become the Flagship of the 1st fleet in case of using Fleet Command Facility during a map that involves Combined Fleet, as compared to Battleships, CA(V)s have less of a role when placed in the 1st fleet because it is mostly up to the Battleships to take down majority of the enemies during Day Battle, so the 4th slot is very important for the Battleships.

Players should take caution that Aviation Cruisers (CAV) equipped with [[List of Seaplanes by stats|Seaplane Bombers]] will attack [[Submarine Ka-Class|Enemy Submarines]] if they exist in the Enemy Fleet. In this case, the player should equip the CAV with a Type 0 Recon Plane to avoid it attacking an Enemy Submarine. Also, Aviation Cruisers (CAV) in the 2nd Fleet '''<span style="color:red">DOES NOT</span>''' send out Seaplane Bomber during Aerial Combat phase.

====The Lucky Heavy Cruisers (Above 30 Luck)====
Some Heavy Cruisers, which is in fact '''Aoba Kai, Myoukou Kai Ni, '''and''' Prinz Eugen Kai''', have over 30 Luck which gives them the option to use Night Battle Cut-In Attack. However this is mostly only recommended if Night Battle Nodes (The ones where you start Night Battle right away instead of going through Day Battle first) are involved, and when you are forced to use a Fleet that only consists of Surface Ships such as BB, CA, CL, and DD where no Aircraft Carriers/Seaplane Tenders are allowed to be brought.

Always remember that Recon Seaplanes are required if there are ELoS requirements to reach Boss, but you may use a RADAR instead to meet the requirements. This means that when it comes to maps that do not allow CV(L)/AVs to be brought, you may consider taking out the Recon Plane and just use a RADAR.

====Anti-Air Heavy Cruiser: Maya Kai Ni====
On March 13, 2015, [[Maya]] had received a Kai Ni which turned her into an Anti-Air focused Heavy Cruiser. She boasts the 2nd highest Anti-Air stats in the game with the 1st highest being [[Akizuki]]. Before, CAs could not utilize [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Anti-Air_Cut-In Anti-Air Cut-In] without sacrificing Artillery Spotting and use a very crappy equipment setup. But now it is possible for CAs to utilize both Artillery Spotting and use Anti-Air Cut-In at once by using the [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], although capabilities are still limited because Day Battle Double Attack is '''IMPOSSIBLE''' to use with Anti-Air Cut-In setup. However in the past, DDs were mostly the ones responsible for using Anti-Air Cut-In to shoot down enemy aircraft. However with Maya, it is now possible to use her to utilize a proper CA to use Anti-Air Cut-In.

===Light Cruiser (CL)===
In a map that requires a single fleet, CLs will most likely be just required for Branching Rules, which means you don't necessarily need to use a CL unless required by that map. However in Combined Fleet, having at least 1 CL is '''MANDATORY''' (CLT doesn't count) in the 2nd Fleet. How you utilize your CL is up to you but using the correct Equipment setup is required.

====Light Cruisers with 4 Equipment Slots: Yuubari and Ooyodo====
[[Yuubari]] and [[Ooyodo]] are known to have 4 Equipment slots despite being CLs. However both have one difference: the Aircraft Slot. Yuubari may have 4 Equipment Slots, but her Aircraft Slot stat is 0, which means she cannot utilize a Recon Seaplane and cannot gain any Artillery Spotting effects. Ooyodo however does have Aircraft Slot stats and it is actually quite big for a CL, which means she can utilize Artillery Spotting Effects via Recon Plane, such as using Double Attack. In fact because she has 4 slots, she practically has the same Double Attack trigger rate as CAs and BBs. Also the fact Ooyodo has very high LoS stats which will help you in Branching Rules that require high [[Line of Sight|Effective Line of Sight (ELoS)]] requirements. Yuubari and Ooyodo can do either the same kind of roles or a different role due to their difference.

====Light Cruiser who is a Faker CLT: Abukuma Kai Ni====
Abukuma is currently the only CL that is able to equip the Type A Ko-Hyoteki, making her function practically same as CLTs. However her stats are even lower than Kiso Kai Ni that she still loses to the true CLTs in terms of stats. However as she is officially classified as a CL still, she is a very good ship to use for the CL slot in the requirement for a fleet.

===Torpedo Cruiser (CLT)===
Torpedo Cruisers are extremely essential and required for any maps possible if they are allowed to be brought (Some maps blocks CLTs from entering). In Night Battle, they are practically One-Shot KO Boss Killers, especially Kitakami Kai Ni. One mandatory equipment that a CLT must always have is the [[Type A Ko-hyoteki]], which enables the CLTs to do pre-emptive Torpedo Attack after the Aerial Combat phase.

===Destroyers (DD)===
It has caught my attention for a while that a lot of the newer Admirals always have trouble giving Destroyers the proper Equipment setup. But in fact it is very simple. It should be noted that players should try to level up standard/common Destroyers at least, just in case '''Ship Locking mechanism''' happens in the Event. One thing to mention for sure is that in Combined Fleet, you need about 3 to 4 Destroyers in the 2nd Fleet.
====Destroyers below 30 Luck stats====
It has come to my attention for quite a while that a lot of people for some reason equip all of their Destroyers that are '''below 30 Luck''' stat with Torpedoes or 3 Main Guns. This is however '''<span style="color:red">INCORRECT</span>'''. If Destroyers (CL/CA included in fact) were equipped with Torpedoes alone, or along with Main Guns, this would make them use '''Night Battle Cut-In Attack''', which they cannot consistently trigger if their Luck stat is very low as the trigger rate is completely Luck stat based. Ships below 30 Luck should be utilizing the '''Double Attack setup''' to be used in Night Battle which is a consistent and powerful attack.

====Destroyers below 30 Luck: Night Battle Cut-In Setup via [[Skilled Lookouts]]====
Although above I have stated that Destroyers cannot use Night Battle Cut-In setup due to their Low Luck,''' there is an exception to this'''. You may equip the Skilled Lookouts which will increase the Cut-In Attack trigger rate for the ship that is equipped to, and ships with low luck is no exception to this. You may choose to equip Skilled Lookouts on a Destroyer below 30 Luck, but beware since their Luck is low in the first place, the trigger rate might be still low by a bit.

====Anti-Air Cut-In Destroyers====
Ever since [[Akizuki]]'s debut, the [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Anti-Air_Cut-In Anti-Air Cut-In] system has come into play which enables the ship equipped with the correct setup able to shoot down several of the Enemy CV(L)'s Aircraft. In fact, sometimes you may even shoot down all of the Enemy bombers down to 0, which would totally disable the enemy CV from attacking due to them running out of Bomber Planes. This is '''extremely important''' and a '''very high priority''' as the Event will be infested with powerful CV Enemies such as [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class|Standard Carrier Wo-class Kai Flagship]] (Black Wo Shooter) and [[Aircraft Carrier Demon]] or [[Aircraft Carrier Princess|Princess]], who have powerful Air Superiority Power and Bomber Planes that can even potentially wreck your Yamato-class. This is where Destroyers equipped with Anti-Air Cut-In setup comes into play, where they try to protect your allied ships from getting bombed by the Enemy Aircraft.

====The Lucky Destroyers (Above 30 Luck)====
In contrast to Destroyers whose Luck stats are below 30, the Destroyers who have Luck above it have more versatility. This is because Destroyers above 30 Luck, especially the Goddess of Luck Yukikaze, who has 60 Luck, can utilize Night Battle Cut-In Attack quite frequently. However beware that Night Battle Cut-In is still RNG-based, where even Yukikaze can fail to initiate Night Battle Cut-In Attack...

'''Applicable Ships''':[[Ayanami| Ayanami Kai Ni]], [[Shigure|Shigure Kai Ni]], [[Hatsushimo|Hatsushimo Kai Ni]], [[Ushio|Ushio Kai Ni]], [[Yukikaze|Yukikaze Kai]], and Any Destroyers who had their Luck raised up to 30 and above via Modernization by having 5x [[Maruyu|Maruyu Kai]] fed at once.

===Anti-Landbase Warfare Destroyer===
After the introduction of [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|WG42]], it has become possible for Light Cruisers and Destroyers to be more effective in taking down a Landbase-type Enemy Boss such as Harbour Water Demon, Anchorage Water Demon, or Harbour Princess. However please note that WG42 is still less effective compared to Type 3 Shell, so if you aren't required to use Destroyers or Light Cruisers in your fleet in a map that has a Landbase-type enemy as the boss, just focus on using CA/BB with Type 3 Shell.
Daihatsu has also been implemented as an effective equipment to use against certain types of Installation Bosses.

===Aircraft Carrier (CV) / Light Aircraft Carrier (CVL)===
Your CV and CVL's Equipment setup all depends on how much AS (Air Superiority) is required in the Map you will be going through. Usually when there are multiple (Usually 2 to 3 average) [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class Flagship III]] (and higher) and/or [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class Kai Flagship|Kai Flagships]] appearing will require you to have several high-class Fighters (Anything above 8+ AA stats usually) in a CV. Depending on the variant of the Wo-class they have around 100~132 AS power per Wo-class.

Just remember that if you happen to know that multiple Wo-class variants mentioned above will be appearing as a fleet in the Map you will be entering; Have about 380~400+ Air Superiority ready (Remember your AS will decrease the more Fighters that get shot down per node). More so if multiple Kai Flagships will be appearing in a single enemy fleet in several nodes. 

If you are using 1 CV, you may be forced to use 4 Fighters on all slots to gain Air Parity at least or somehow gain AS, along with use of BBVs to gain a few more additional AS to gain Air Superiority against the enemy Carrier Fleet (This is usually the case if you are using Combined Fleet - Surface Task Force). But remember this is only the case if you will be facing multiple high-class powerful enemy CVs. If using Surface Task Force in Combined Fleet, you may use 2 CVLs instead of 1 CV and somehow gain both AS and a few room to use Bombers. But this really depends on what kind of enemy Carriers you will be facing in the end.

If you are using 2 CV, you may have a few rooms for 2 Bomber + 2 Fighters, depending on the Air Superiority requirements. Usually you won't if you will be facing several powerful enemy Carriers multiple times and may be forced to use 3 Fighters + 1 Bombers.  

If you are able to use 3 or more CVs, then you will usually have plenty of room to use a lot of Bombers and less Fighters and gain about 400+ AS average, as long as you aren't using bad Fighters all over (even with Double Chevron Proficiency). This is usually the case when you will be using Combined Fleet - Carrier Task Force, which allows use of 4 CVs/CVLs mixed. 

Move your Bombers and Fighters around on your CV(L)s' equipment slots to your liking to meet the Air Superiority standards and have a balanced setup for your CV(L)s. However remember that the lower the slot number is, the planes in those slots may get depeleted more faster than the higher numbered slots, depending on the enemy you face. Usual culprits for shooting down a large number of your bombers are usually enemy CVs and Light Cruiser Tsu-Class who is known to have high Anti-Air stats and is suspected of being able to trigger AACI. If a CV(L) has an extremely low number on one or two of her slots, then equip Fighters on them as they are not prone to get shot down easily as Bombers.
===Submarines (SS/SSV)===

As explained before, Submarines are only required if the Branching Rules requires it to be in your fleet or if the Boss is someone similar to [[Light Cruiser Demon]] and you want an easier time against the Boss. Otherwise there is absolutely no need to bring a Submarine in Combined Fleet or in a single fleet even if you were allowed to. Bringing a Submarine is not recommended because all of the Events are infested with Late Model Enemy Destroyers these days, along with Flagship-level CL, DD, and Light Cruiser Tsu-class, who are all equipped with both SONAR and Depth Charge which would practically wreck your Submarine with ease.

Usually Submarines are equipped with like two Torpedoes, but in Events, that is not exactly viable since the Submarine would definitely get wrecked into Heavy Damage quickly.

'''In Events, there are about three options you could use: '''

{| class="wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:700px;"
|-
! colspan="1" |
View Submarine Equipment Setups
|-
! scope="col" style="text-align: center;"|
'''Option 1: Survival through [[Repair Team]]/[[Repair Goddess]]'''
|-
| colspan="2"|
I am sure majority of you barely or never used Repair Teams at all in this game since all of the Equipment slots are very important and valuable that you can't exactly waste it on a Repair Team, unless this was World 3-2 where you had to clear it with 6 Destroyers.

You may have a Submarine equipped with two Repair Team/Repair Goddess so that it will survive at least two times from sinking (But your heart might not be able to take the "sinking animation" Q_Q).

Remember that if the Submarine sinks two times and revives, she will be out of Repair Team/Repair Goddess. The next time she sinks, it is guaranteed death for her, so if the 2nd Repair Team/Repair Goddess is activated, she will have no more chances. This means the next time she goes into Heavy Damage, you MUST retreat.

'''Option 2: Survival attempt with increased Evasion through [[List of Engine|Engines]]'''
|-
| colspan="2"|If you don't have Repair Team or Repair Goddess, the only other option is bringing a Submarine fully equipped with Engines to increase her evasion. The most recommended Engine is the [[New High Pressure-Temperature Steam Boiler]] which comes from [[Amatsukaze|Amatsukaze Kai]], which gives 13+ Evasion. However even with this, your Submarine still can get wrecked by enemy DD/CLs, so compared to Option #1, you might retreat more with this setup.

===Seaplane Tender (AV)===
The Seaplane Tenders have few options to use when it comes to utilizing them in combat. However their stats aren't exactly that good in the end, so avoid using them unless 100% required due to Branching Rules.

====Chitose/Chiyoda AV====
As explained above, they have more diversity in equipment settings so if you are required to use an AV, you will definitely be using them.

====Akitsushima Kai====
As explained beforehand, Akitsushima isn't exactly suited for Combat and is mostly used for LoS purposes or semi-ASW support.

She did gain the ability to equip Daihatsu Landing Craft and WG42, so she can be used for Anti-Landbase purpose ship but her damage output can be low.

===[[Akitsu Maru|Akitsu Maru Kai (LHA)]]===
As explained above before, Akitsu Maru is sometimes''' required due to Branching Rules''' (However other options do exist where you don't even have to use her, although things do become a bit more complex). However Akitsu Maru is totally useless when it comes to combat, that the only role she will have in the fleet is to have 3 Reppuu equipped to give 84+ Air Superiority stat for your fleet.

==Preparations for the Event #9: Leveling your Ships==
We now know which ships are recommended and the good equipment setups that go with them. However now where to level the ships to Kai Ni or to satisfactory levels? All of these are available in the [[Tutorial: Leveling]] section, but I will just list a summary of places to level.

===Other ways to Level your Ship: PvP===
Try to do PvP as much as possible as they give a great amount of EXP (Unless the opponent's Flagship + 2nd Ship are Level 1...) But beware that bringing CVs with Bomber Planes may decrease your bauxite by a huge amount, especially if the Opponent has any ships that have Anti-AIr Cut-In setup, so avoid using CVs as much as you can.

==Preparations for the Event #10: Sparkling==

[[File:KanColle-150420-12490467.jpg|thumb|center|400px|100 Morale Sparkled Shigure Kai Ni]]

As many players may or may not know, Sparkling your ships can lead to some good performance from them.

Sparkling will increase the ship's evasion and accuracy. However this game is still RNG, so even if you Sparkle the ship, she might get wrecked, so beware...

Also, another thing you should watch out is that if you somehow went into a Dead End or the wrong route, your sparkle may become wasted, and this is worse if you somehow got Disconnected as you lose some morale after a sortie ends.

It is highly recommended that you pick which ships you will use for the Event beforehand and sparkle them to max (100 if sparkled through PvP, 85 if through Sorties).

For more details on Sparkling, '''[[Morale/Fatigue|PLEASE CLICK HERE]]'''
==Preparations for the Event #11: Modernization==
[[File:KanColle-150419-15413522.jpg|thumb|center|400px]]
'''This is mostly in regards to the newer players who are still inexperienced with this game'''.

It is highly recommended that you modernize all of the ships that will be participating in the Event to MAX.
*'''Firepower''' is important because it will help you take down your enemies faster.
*'''Torpedo''' stat is important in Torpedo phase, but also during Night Battle as it uses both Firepower and Torpedo stat for Damage calculation.
*'''Anti-Air''' is very important, especially in this event as it will be majorly CV focused that you probably would want a lot of Anti-Air stats, especially in regards to the ship who will be using Anti-Air Cut-In.
*'''Armor''' will be important for the Ship's survival from the enemy's attack.
===Stats other than Firepower, Torpedo, Anti-Air, and Armor===
Please know that the other stats such as Evasion can only be increased from Leveling up, so please try to level up your ships more even if their Main stats are maxed through Modernization. Luck can be increased by feeding 5 copies of Maruyu Kai at once.
==Preparations for the Event #12: Know your Enemies==


===[[Enemy Vessel|Please Click here to see the Enemies section ]]===


==Preparations for the Event #13: Support Shelling Expedition==


[[File:【KanColle】 Event Support Shelling Expedition Example|thumb|center|335 px]]

Support expeditions involve sending a fleet into an expedition to provide additional bombardment during the [[Combat|opening stages of Combat]]. For the Event, the Support Expedition is available on the bottom right section when you open the Expedition Page.

There are two types of support expedition; normal support and boss support:
*'''The 15 Minutes Expedition''' is a Normal Support Expedition. It gives support at every node other than boss node with ~50% chance to trigger at each node.
*'''The 30 Minutes Expedition''' is a Boss support expedition. It gives support at the boss node with ~80% chance to trigger.
Events usually come with their exclusive support expeditions that can only be used throughout the event. These event expeditions are unlocked by default.

'''Sparkling your ships (mainly flagship) increases the probability to trigger support while using fatigued ships reduces it'''. Furthermore, support does not work on nodes that begin in night battle. Support expeditions will end if either of these two conditions are fulfilled:
#Finish a sortie.
#The timer runs out.
It is recommended to start a sortie immediately after the support expedition has been sent in order to avoid the timer running out halfway through the sortie.

===Support Types===
A support expedition requires a minimum of '''at least 2 DDs (Destroyers)'''. The other 4 slots affect what type of support will be provided. The only Support Expedition that is actually worth using is the Support Shelling type, so I will only be mentioning information on that:

{| border="1" class="wikitable" width="100%"
! width="10%" |Type
! width="25%" |Info
! width="10%" |Recommended Fleet Composition
! width="15%" |Costs
! width="20%" |Pros
! width="20%" |Cons
|-
! Support Shelling
| Medium to long distance shelling attack with concentrated power
| 2 BB + 2 DD + 2 CV
| 50% Fuel, 80% Ammo
|
*High damage if hit.
*Likely to sink enemy's ship.
|
*High cost
|}

===Shelling damage calculation===

Ship's damage is dependent on firepower stats. However, CVs and CVLs are calculated differently using the following equation: Firepower (FP), Torpedo (TP), Divebomb (DB)

<div align="center" style="margin:20px;"><span style="border:1px red solid;padding:10px;"><math>Damage= 55 + (1.5 * FP) + (1.5 * \sum(TP)) + (2.0 * \sum(DB)) </math></span></div>

For example; a fully modernized [[Kaga| Kaga Kai]] with 4 slots of [[Suisei Model 12A]], which provide a total sum of 40 dive bombing power (10 dive-bomb for each Suisei Model 12A):

<div align="center" style="margin:20px;"><span style="border:1px red solid;padding:10px;"><math>Damage = 55 + (1.5 * 49) + (1.5 * 0) + (2.0 * (10 + 10 + 10 + 10)) = 208 </math></span></div>

Accuracy, [[User blog:Homuhomu123/Shelling Accuracy Test Results|Overweight Penalty]] and [[Type 91 Armor-Piercing (AP) Shell|AP Shells]] do affect support expeditions' performance. Therefore, it is recommended to sparkle your fleet or equip accuracy equipment (Ex. [[List of Radars by stats|Radar]]) onto your fleet.

==Preparations for the Event #14: Tips that may lead to your Success==
Although how you play the game is your choice, I hope that you will at least take these tips into consideration so that you will have much easier time doing the Event and to not have your sanity flushed down the toilet...
===Tip #1: Save your Resources before the Event===
*Try to avoid using too much resources before the Event, especially in Crafting. Limit your Construction + Development to 4 times per day (as in only do it during the Daily Construction/Development Quest). Try to avoid using Buckets as much as possible. If you power level in World 1-5 for DD/CLs and 3-2 for BB, CA, CV(L), you will lessen the use of Buckets.
===='''<span style="color:red">DO NOT DO LSC BEFORE OR DURING THE EVENT!!! </span>'''====
LSC takes a large chunk amount of Resources away from you. '''AVOID IT AT ALL COST BEFORE OR DURING THE EVENT!!!''' Even if the bait is strong, or you feel extremely jealous because someone else you know got lucky, AVOID IT. Events are a once in a limited time opportunity while you have several chances to do LSC later on. Even if you obtain the ship you want from LSC, getting it ready for the Event would take even more amount of resources, especially more so if it was Yamato-class.
===Tip #2: Prepare a large amount of variety of ships as possible===
*'''Prepare at least 3 to 4 of each type of ships'''. This is mostly because of [[Combined Fleet]] and even worse because of '''Ship Locking'''. If you prepare only a few amount of each ship class, you may bump into a wall because you lack the correct amount of ships that are required or may lack the correct ship class which is absolutely required by the Branching Rules. Also if Ship Locking happens which even requires Combined Fleets to be used (which would require about 24 different ships at high level for two different maps that are divided by Ship Locking), you may really be in trouble due to lacking ships.
*Here is a sample list of how much ships you will usually require if you will be doing Medium/Hard difficulty in a Large-Scale Event with Ship Locking. This is based on data gathered from Summer 2015 Event, the most recent Large-Scale Event.
**10+ Destroyers (DD)
**4+ Light Cruisers (CL)
**2+ Torpedo Cruiser (CLT)
**6+ Heavy Cruisers (CA)
**2+ Aviation Cruisers (CAV)
**4+ Fast Battleships (FBB)
**2+ Battleships or Aviation Battleships (BB(V))
**4+ Aircraft Carrier or Armored Aircraft Carrier (CV(B))
**5+ Light Aircraft Carrier (CVL)
**0~1 Submarine (SS(V))
**1 to 2 Seaplane Tender (AV)
**1 Akitsumaru (LHA)
**2+ Anti-Air Cut-In specialized Ship (High AA-stat Destroyer(s), Isuzu Kai Ni, and/or Maya Kai Ni)
*If you are doing straight Easy mode for the entire event, since Ship Locking won't apply to you, you may use the same ships over and over again for the entire Event so you don't need as much as ships listed above.
===Tip #3: Avoid doing an Event Map on Harder difficulties if you aren't confident===
The previous Year 2015 Events have all proved that the rewards differ depending on which difficulty you do. However for some maps, the reward difference between the difficulties were somewhat minor.

'''Let's take E-4 from Winter 2015 Event as an example:'''
*Clearing on Hard (甲): [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Katori Katori], 1 Medal, 6 Improvement Materials
*Clearing on Medium (乙): [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Katori Katori], 1 Medal, 3 Improvement Materials
*Clearing on Easy (丙): [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Katori Katori]
As you can see, the only difference between Medium and Hard was 3 Improvement Materials (AKA Screws), which made clearing the map on Hard Mode practically pointless excluding fame and praise between your friends. If the miscellaneous rewards are shown to be very minor, for the sake of your sanity and resources, try to avoid doing harder difficulties.

However if there is an Equipment reward that is only available in the harder difficulties, then it is highly recommended that you challenge yourself in trying to get that Equipment as it won't appear in the game ever again until who knows when, which might be never, until next year, or even more later on.

'''Let's take E-2 from Winter 2015 Event as an example:'''
*Clearing on Hard (甲): Irako , 3 Improvement Materials, 1 [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Ryuusei_%28601_Air_Group%29 Ryuusei (601 Air Group)], 1 [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Prototype_51cm_Twin_Cannon Prototype 51cm Twin Cannon]
*Clearing on Medium (乙): Irako, 1 [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Repair_Team Repair Team], 1 [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Ryuusei_%28601_Air_Group%29 Ryuusei (601 Air Group)]
*Clearing on Easy (丙): Irako, 1 [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Repair_Team Repair Team], 1 [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Tenzan_%28601_Air_Group%29 Tenzan (601 Air Group)]
As you can see, the Hard Difficulty in the map was extremely rewarding compared to the other lower difficulties, which made doing the map in Hard difficulty very much worth it. However the sad fact was that this was only applicable to Admirals who were above Level 80 HQ as players who were below the level could not access the Hard difficulty.

However even if the difference between the rewards were garbage, there were some maps that made doing Harder difficulties more worth it: '''The Drops'''. During the previous Winter 2015 Event, some ships were only available as drops in either Medium and Hard, or just Hard difficulty alone (Ex. Isokaze, I-401, and Yahagi). For players who were after such ships, they had no choice but to do the harder difficulties in order to obtain the ships. So unless there is a rare exclusive ship that you want badly, avoid doing the harder difficulties. On a side note, it was speculated that the Drop Rate of some ships differed between the difficulties but this was never proven.
===Tip #4: Avoid Rushing the Event or Entering the Event on Day 1===
This tip is mostly directed towards the more newer Admirals. There will be Veteran Admirals who will volunteer on exploring the Event on the 1st Day in order to gather information on the Branching Rules, the Boss Fleet Composition, the Drops, and the Rewards. There is absolutely no need for you to do that yourself. There are over millions of players in this game worldwide, so even if you don't do it, someone else will most likely gather the information. In fact, I would avoid doing the Event for about half the week or for the 1st week whole so that enough information has been gathered.

It's your choice, but you may either wait for the other Veterans to lay out the information for the community which will most likely take about 3 to 5 days so that you can just follow the information to have an easier time with the Event, or jump into the Event on Day 1 and go through several sessions of Trial & Error due to using the wrong kind of Fleet Composition which will cost you more resources. In fact this is worse if you did not stockpile on a large amount of resources.

Also, waiting out for the information to be available by the other Veterans is recommended because of the Drops that will be available in the Event Maps. As mentioned before, some drops may be only available in Medium or Hard difficulty, or just Hard difficulty alone. So if you did the Event early in Easy just to have an easier time, then only to find out a ship you wanted really badly is revealed to be only available as a drop in Medium or Hard difficulty, then you just dug your own grave...

An Event is usually around 3~4 Weeks. That is a plenty amount of time to clear the Event as long as you are patient in your progress. There is no need to try to rush it on Day 1 to 3 where your resources will be reduced to dust after compared to the players who were patient.
===Tip #5: Farm Ships on Easy Mode if possible, and BEFORE you clear the Map===
Some rare ships will be available to obtain as drops on all of the difficulties, Easy to Hard (Ex. Prinz Eugen and Graf Zeppelin were available as drop in E-4 from Easy to Hard). This means that there is absolutely no need to go farming the ships on harder difficulties unless there is proof that the harder difficulties have higher drop rate (Ex. Prinz Eugen wasn't available as a drop if you had faced a Diamond Formation variant of an Enemy Fleet in E-4 node M Easy Mode).

Also, this was mentioned before, but if you want to farm ships in Easy mode, '''do that before you completely clear the map for good'''. As the Difficulty Selection System allows you to choose your difficulties as long as you didn't clear the Map for good (as in totally destroy the Boss HP Bar), you may switch the difficulties around to keep farming on Easy endlessly (Ex. Farm on Easy mode until the final Boss HP Bar, then switch to Medium difficulty, enter the map which will reset the Boss Bar back to Full, retreat on first node, then go back to Easy mode again).

Some Admirals during the previous event suffered because they cleared the Map on Medium/hard first then tried to farm for drops which made things way harder for them due to the resource consumption and because their target ship was not dropping for a long time ('''Ex'''. some players cleared E-4 on Hard difficulty first, then proceeded to farm Unryuu from the map after. '''They suffered A LOT''').

This isn't exactly required if the map itself is really easy even in Hard (Ex. Winter 2015 E-1 was very easy to farm).
===Tip #6: Do not be Hasty. Do not be Desperate. Be Patient.===
One of the most important aspect of the Event: '''Your sanity'''. RNG-sama will definitely be there to troll you hard several times. An example would be a situation where you go through very difficult pre-boss nodes and reach the final pre-boss node right before the boss, but then you get wrecked. If you are unlucky, expect such situations to happen several times.

But you have around 2 to 4 weeks to do the Event. You have plenty of time even with Work and School as you can do it slowly during the time. There is absolutely no need to rush it on day 1 or something because you gain nothing from doing such thing (other than praise and fame among your fellow players maybe). Just more sanity draining, more resource drains, along with tons of trial and error.

There are also those desperate players who actually sink their very high leveled ship just to finish an Event Map. Even during Winter 2015 there were such cases happening, especially in E-5 Hard difficulty (Except for some, they still failed to even kill the Boss Flagship despite the sacrifice). '''DON'T DO THIS. EVER. '''

Sinking your ships won't get you anywhere in the Event. Just losses. Sure if you have tons of time laying around to train it back from scratch, it is your choice whether you want to go through the sacrifice to have your past efforts go in vain. But always remember that just because the character sprite is the same, she won't be the same one you had spent your time with in the past... >_<

Patience is the key to everything in this game. Please remember this.
==Conclusion==
I know this was a really LONG guide, but I hope you took your time in reading through this guide. Although the newer Admirals might not know this, but Events are very much serious business for the players...

If you have any Questions, please feel free to comment to ask me anything (some other people who are available at the time may help too)

I hope you enjoy the upcoming Event with all your heart's content and that your efforts pay off.

'''Good Luck to Everyone!'''
