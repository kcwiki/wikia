Began collecting shipgirls 5/9/14, right after the Spring 2014 event. 
Back (ish) after extended break.Still confused by all of the new things: American ships? French ships? Russian ships? Land-based aircraft? Superloli DEs?!? (that aren't DEs at all but we're calling them DEs because Kaibokan have no USN equivalents?!)

Can read moonrunes and talk moonspeak.  Does translation cleanups, as well as prettify language and pick nits with wording, layout and overall wiki design.  Writes or something (very or something, lately) for a living in RL.  Likes Japanese language, anime weirdness, and military history, among other things.  Is responsible for the creation of the [[Historical Formations]] and [[Historical Fates & Sinkings]] pages.

Does not have a favorite shipgirl.  Leaves no shipgirl behind, also refuses to keep clones around.  It's creepy and messes with my internal narrative.

Has a long internal narrative, including extensive theorizing on the Industrial Magical Girl nature of Shipgirls, their origin, creation and purpose and their relationship to the Abyssals.  It more or less meshes with the anime 'canon'.  Hates the idea that shipgirls 'possess' normal girls or can 'stop being' shipgirls.  No.  Shipgirls are only ever shipgirls.

Minmaxing is for losers who don't believe in the power of love.  Addicted to Kai Nis (In Need of Remodeling:  Suzuya, Musashi,  Kumano, Taiyou, Shinyou, Makigumo).

==='''Favored Shipgirls'''===

* [[Akagi]] - I didn't care for her much at first, but ever since she got her slip-of-the-tongue idle line I've really adored how she's both a slightly silly woman who loves to eat and a serious, proud member of the First Carrier Division.
* [[Kirishima]] - First Battleship.  Mike check mfers.
*[[Souryuu]] - Second Provisional Wife.  Best CV.
*[[Kongou]] - Basically the perfect woman. Third Provisional Wife.
* [[Mutsu]] - 爆乳。 Also she's a sweetheart.
* [[Takao]]-class:  [[Takao]] was my first Heavy Cruiser and one of my longest-standing secretary ships.  [[Maya]]-sama is just badass.  [[Choukai]] is another lovely smart glasses girl who knows her shit in night battles.  And [[Atago]] is Atago.
* [[Inazuma]] - Starter.  Good girl.  I really should have gone with [[Sazanami]] in retrospect, but her original CG...
* [[Goya]] - Best submarine-dechi.  First provisional wife (cause she was my first 99 and I was eager to finish the quests, so more a friendly pairing than wuv).  Why do all the fanworks write her as a ruthless bitch, though?  She's nice.  Now rescued from the eternal hell of Orel Cruising by Phase 2.
*[[Suzuya]], [[Kumano]] - You girls are literally so great.  Though I'm getting really tired of people drawing Kumano's boobs the same size as Suzuya's.  Weirdest pet peeve.  Also no lie I'm not happy about you both needing two blueprints each, 'specially when I'm probably not gonna use you as CVLs...
*[[Yuugumo]] class - I'm not sure why, but you're my favorite set of destroyers.  Maybe it's the uniform.  And [[Yuugumo]] herself.  And [[Makigumo]], and [[Naganami]]-sama, and [[Hamanami]], and [[Kiyoshimo]]... okay yeah.
*[[Kuroshio]] - You were my first Kagero-class and I've always thought you were adorbs.
*[[Ryuuhou]] - Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggg.
*[[Yamato]] - Big heart, big guns.  Onee-chan.
*[[Asashio]]-class - I LOVE your K2 Artworks.  Worth the blueprints.
*[[Shoukaku]] - Zuizui is fun, but I like Ms. Misfortune so much more.
*[[Agano]] - Best Light Cruiser.  Fight me.
* Destroyer Death Squad:
** [[Shigure]] - My first level 99 Destroyer.  Clearly the smartest of her class.  Also, small boobs.  Quit drawing it wrong, fan artists, she's not stacked, just cute.  Congratulations on season 2 anime protagonist, apparently.
** [[Yuudachi]] - You're... not a particularly smart girl, but you mean well and are friendly and I like you quite a bit.  Also, not being that smart just means she doesn't understand she shouldn't have the firepower of a heavy cruiser.
** [[Ayanami]] - Aggressively nice and nicely aggressive.  Smarter than Yuudachi and stronger than Shigure.  You're a fine and proper lady and a good example to your younger sisters.
** [[Murasame]] - Destroyers <i><b>are not</b></i> for lewds... but you test my devotion to that rule pretty hard.
** [[Urakaze]] - Maximum sub-killer.  Everyone fawns over your little sister [[Hamakaze]], but I think you're way hotter.  I mean, uh, destroyers aren't for lewds.

===<span style="font-weight:bold;">Missing Shipgirls  :(</span>===
* Foreign Girls - [[Iowa]], [[Saratoga]], [[Gambier Bay]], [[Intrepid]], [[Samuel B. Roberts]], [[Luigi Torelli]], [[Warspite]], [[Jervis]], [[Richelieu]], [[Gangut]], [[Tashkent]], [[Johnston]]
* Destroyers - [[Suzutsuki]], [[Kamikaze]], [[Asakaze]], [[Harukaze]], [[Hatakaze]], [[Hayanami]]
* Auxiliaries - [[Kashima]]
* Little Bits - [[Sado]], [[Tsushima]], [[Fukae]]
* Swimsuit Brigade - [[I-14]], [[I-400]]

===Commentary on Other Girls===
* [[Kisaragi]] - Let's keep this professional, young lady.  Though you're a sweetling and I'm glad that whoever the TTK was in the anime got a fresh non-abyssalized drop of you.
* [[Ooi]] - A very honest (to herself, not always to me) and emotional girl. With lots of torpedoes. I don't dislike that.
* [[Fusou]], [[Yamashiro]] - Prettiest battleships.  Yamashiro was also the second one I ever got.  I really miss Fuso K1's damaged art after remodeling them both, though.
* [[Asashimo]] - You're not the cutest (though I dig the shark teeth and the "Ace da ze" attitude) or the strongest, but the fact that I waited for you the longest will always matter.  Welcome home.
* [[Uzuki]] - You know, your voice annoys the shit out of me, but putting you in charge of bringing me buckets has made me much happier to hear it.
* [[Maruyu]] - If I said I was sorry, would it how much I make you suffer more acceptable? I wouldn't mean it, though.  Well, I guess I'm nicer now that 3-2-1 is gone, but you're still an Army girl who barely qualifies as a submarine.
