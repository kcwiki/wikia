== About myself a.k.a the Admiral ==
Started my journey as an Admiral on March 2015.Use to be a progressive good yet strong admiral until 29th April 2016......working at Paramunshir Anchorage with the name ワイト・クン

Been in the Wiki for a long time for checking guides, but never made a wikia account until 26th August 2016

Now, rather than becoming the old me which is a Vice-Admiral, I become the Recovering Admiral to recover my huge lost that has happened on that very day.

== My Goal's for my future ==
* Manage to rebuild my fallen fleet back
* Manage to reunited with [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Zuihou Zuihou] and remarry her back .
* Manage to buy some slots (Ship slot , Repair Dock slot , Construction slot )
* Passing all HARD mode on all Event season
* Getting my Fleet stronger than my past
* Manage to help others like newcomer and also friend to help with the journey as an Admiral, just like the past
* Manage to find the culprit behind this and not having any involvement with those shitty KC groups in Facebook
