*2nd Event.
*Total Time Spent = 18 days
Had to downgrade to Normal when there's less than 15k Fuel & 2 days left. A bit bitter that I missed out on an All Hard Clear, but securing Warspite comes first.

Like last time I'm farming every map on Easy before switching to Hard for clear. Trying to keep up with self-imposed schedule is stressful, but having ample resources to start with helped a lot (1 less thing to worry about).

E4H is just a RNG fest this time round - tried all sorts of compositions (except super heavy, don't have LSC BB) but only get to the boss 25% of the time at best. Then the girls have to survive more RNG during the day, THEN mroe RNG at yasen.

Seriously, E4H becomes VERY unpleasant after a few bad beat (CV-Hime always snipe the next healthy ship without fail and mess up firing orders). Even after 150 sorties (and ~120k fuel/ammo spent) I had to downgrade to Normal at the 72h mark. By then the RNG has become too unbearable and for the first time the game feels like a '''chore''' rather than enjoyment. No regret for switching, but bitter... very bitter.
[[File:2016-Fall-Drop_Summary.png|thumb|Another big haul!]]
E5H was piss easy compared to E4H. Done unlocking 2nd starting point + debuff in ~10 runs. Only took 7 runs to finish the whole thing, no support expeditions till LD (and that was probably overkill in retrospect).

The loot this time is pretty good too, most notably 2nd Akashi and my first pair of duckies! Only a few girls left to rescue now...

[[File:Resources_Chart.jpg|thumb|F=Farm.  Sure spent a lot on them =.=]]
Following the trend of the last few events, I planned to farm a map on Easy before switching to Hard for clear. Ran into a speed bump this time though: only found 1 Yuu in 320+ runs (on Normal)! Since I don't have her (and her WG) till now, I made a strategic decision to clear on Normal and return to farm later. (This decision turned out correct in the end)

E2 farming was rather painless, even with freshly kai'ed Historic Fleet. Fujinami appeared around 20 runs so it didn't take long to clear E2H ([http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/kancolle/images/d/d5/%E7%A8%B2%E8%8D%B7_18340_2017-Winter-E2H_LD_%281-run%29.png 1 LD run]).

E3 farming reminds me of E1 (gasps) but it paid off in the end. I-13 appeared just when my KC3 history's about to hit Page 9 (20 sorties per page). To my surprise, soon after switching to [http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/kancolle/images/d/d7/%E7%A8%B2%E8%8D%B7_18667_2017-Winter-E3E-J_Farming_example.png Node-J farming], Teruzuki appeared on the 4th run! Now the 3 sisters can finally re-unite! :D

Imo [http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/kancolle/images/3/36/%E7%A8%B2%E8%8D%B7_18763_2017-Winter-E3H_Node-I_Debuff.png E3H-I node debuff] was the real pain in this event. There's nothing you can do except pray to the RNG followed by unlimited sparkling works, totally reminds me of E4H of Fall 2016. It took 10 runs in the end =.=

The enemies aren't that much stronger compared to Easy and I get to use LBAS this time (no support/LBAS were used during farming).

I was a bit worried during E3H chipping run, cause I've only 1 clean kill and other runs only took 300-500hp off the lolis on average. That's why I was super surprised to finish [http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/kancolle/images/2/2f/%E7%A8%B2%E8%8D%B7_18932_2017-Winter-E3H_LD_%28S%29.png LD on the 2nd run] (1st was Taiha on M-node).

Got all the ships I'm aiming for (plus some more) with time/resources to spare, feeling pretty good :)

Farming Easy then switch to Hard for clear as usual. RSC consumption was moderate till E5 despite heavy farming. Got all the ships I wanted.

This is my 1st encounter with the pasta BBs so there's no way I'm gonna pass up the chance! End up spending 3 days and close to 70k of each rsc to get them both (Roma @run#60, Littorio @run#98), was well worth it!

I was prepare for a brutal E5H LD but my girls did so well that they killed russian hime during day time =.=

Another great event cleared on All Hard. Sticking to the usual Farm-Easy-First-Clear-On-Hard tactic, since it served me well in the past. Got everyone on my shortlist :)

This event offers more challenges compared to the last few: multiple gauges, RNG-heavy maps (E4H/E7H), Large Scale Ops with 5 locks, etc... overall an expensive one. I love a challenge, ie finding a composition based on what I got on hand to crack the seemingly unbeatable map, but repetitive tasks (E6 2000 TP wtf) ain't my cup of tea. Roulette maps (E4/E7 LD) are even worse and can turn the game into boring gambles (unless one wants to P2W).

[[File:Drop_Summary.png|thumb|right|320px|Not shown: 2x Ooyodo, Libeccio, multiple Mizuho and others.]]

Having said that, my girls pulled through faithfully once again: Ayanami's TCI went through French Hime's armour, while everyone (especially the fairies) pitched in to beat the "impossible" E7H without P2W items. Granted that it was a lucky run in the eyes of many, but as a TTK all I can do is stockpile adequate resources/equipments beforehand and trust my girls; so that when the stars align, they have all the help in the world to do their best. Do not overlook the importance of logistics!

Used 210k fuel, 185k ammo, 100k baux and 1000+ buckets this time, far more than any of my previous events; roughly half-half between farming and clearing. E7H consumed 40k fuel, 35k ammo, 53k baux and 200+ buckets alone! I would've had second thoughts about doing Hard if I didn't start with ample resources.

Another All Hard clear. Fusou's artillery-spotting finished off Entombed AA Hime during daytime 1st shelling round, thereby concluding the event.

[[File:2017-Fall_All-Hard-Clear_sum.png|160px]]

Historians reckon that the Sakusen failed due to lack of coordination required for such complicated battle plan; this can be felt throughout the event, filled with complicated shiplock/routing mechanisms. The most interesting rule is the use of full Green-tagged (Shima) Strike Force starts at the North.

Interestingly, the IJN may have stood a chance if Shima/Nishimura kantai converged before entering the Surigao strait and we're given a chance to test that. Maybe we're meant to sortie Nishimura kantai from where Shima is afterall? Who knows :)

But I gotta say, "small" events nowadays feel like friggin movie marathons... seems like Tanaka's just packing multiple maps into one just to call it whatever-he-likes. I got no problem with multiple bosses, but spare us the gimmicks! The unlocking mechanism feels like such a chore and is taking away the fun imo =.=

Well at least the haul is good. Since my KanDex was completed during last event, farming seem quite repetitive this time round due to limited targets. Got everyone I wanted though :D

Another All Hard Clear, what a way to finish Phase-1! I expected a long event but heck, the cost (both rsc and time) was far worse than anticipated... Never thought my rsc will take a hit that badly (as there was scarcely any farming) =.=

I have to say: the events are getting more tedious and RNG-heavy lately. Since I stick to a ftp style (only buy slots), the runs are getting quite repetitive and not so fun anymore. Hopefully this trend does not continue in Phase-2 and new mechanics will be fun/challenging rather than gimmicky.

Rescued everyone once again, with dupes to boot :)

First real event of Phase-2, got mixed feeling about this.  New mechanics (Nelson Touch) are always welcomed, but the game is getting even more RNG heavy; skills/preparations have little influence on outcomes for those artificially induced fake difficulty.  Feels like TNK has been doing this for the past 2 years:

*New Event requires rolling 9 or better with 2 dice.
*Next Event must be harder, now you need 11+ with 2 dice.
*Too hard for some people, TNK now allow you 3 dice.
*Crap it's too easy, next Event you need to roll 17+ with 3 dice.

...the cycle continues, shifting the game towards RNG heavy territory.  The game is getting less and less enjoyable for me personally, frankly I wouldn't keep going if I were not so emotionally invested with my kanmusu.

In order to counter that, I think a "retired TTK" mentality is required if I were to continue playing this game.  I may not do full Hard anymore, just gonna treat everything as "bonus" from now on :)
