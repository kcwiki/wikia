==My ears! Where did they go?==
Hi! I'm a girl who lives near the Elbe, in a swamp. If you want to find me, find the mossiest tree, and then turn right!

I'm just joking. But you can find me on the Elbe.
==Oh no, where are my eyes?==
I started playing Kancolle during the first Leyte event, which was December 7th, 2017. Doesn't mean I'm any good at this game though, I only seriously started playing around mid-2018! I'm one of those not really old, but kinda old players, since I was a Phase 1 player(I also brag to my friend who also plays Kancolle, that I got Samuel B. Roberts through the anniversary quest, and she didn't).



==Whoopsie. I found my ears and eyes!==
I study mathematics and law. I'm also somewhat into history, but I am completely devoted to music. I can play the piano, flute, and harmonica. I am most interested in classical music. [[File:Vasily Kalinnikov - Symphony no. 1-0|thumb|right|335 px]]

On the right, I linked my favourite classical piece, which is Vasily Kalinnikov's First Symphony. It is not well known.

Vasily Kalinnikov was sadly not a very known composer, but he was praised and helped by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. Sadly, Kalinnikov died of tuberculosis at the young age of 35.




[[File:Tchaikovsky - The Nutcracker, Ballet in two acts Mariinsky Theatre (HD 1080p)|thumb|left|335 px]]

My favourite ballet is The Nutcracker! I have watched the version linked on the left a concerning amount of times. My favourite set of tunes from the Nutcracker are the Spanish Dance, Mother Gigogne, and the Tarantella. It's really a shame that a lot of ballet companies omit Mother Gigogne because it's often the most humourous part of the ballet. The version on the left sadly omits Mother Gigogne,









==Cool miscellaneous stuff about me==
*I collect porcelain dolls, stuffed animals, enamel pins, and bottlecaps.
*For the life of me, I cannot put on eyeshadow, but I can apply eyeliner.
*My favourite colours are pink and gold.
*Birds are okay... I guess.
