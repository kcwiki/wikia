Now, I wonder why the devs haven't implemented this in the game yet...



Every time a ship levels up, why not have it fully healed? Ammo and fuel will remain, but sheesh, give the girl her full health back.



I tend to just play the game and have fun. If you need an answer, I'll help with what I can. :D

Streams for days. :D
