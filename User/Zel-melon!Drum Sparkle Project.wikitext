''Condition Present'': The minimum condition will be used. In this case; the minimum is 3 drums (3 carriers) and 5 ships. 

''Control: ''Drum #, Drum carrier, Ship #, 
*Minor-Control: Flagship Lvl and Combined Fleet level
**This is due to possiblity of ship lvling halfway through the experiment.

Dependent: Great Success (GSc) Rate
*GSc Rate is calculated by [# of Success Run / # of GSc run]
''Test: ''Each test will be done in total of 24 runs each unless more is required.

'''Comment: '''<span style="text-align:start;">I am currently very sastified with the ratio of 24%. This is because if compared to Kitahara's rate of increase the increment from 0 sparkle to 1 sparkle is 13%, then 14%, then 16% indicating that Kitahara's idea about it being linear is legit.</span>
