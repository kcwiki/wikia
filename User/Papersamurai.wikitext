I began Kancolle (mid August 2016) and considered taking part in making this wikia a better place. If anyone has questions about translations, then leave a memo.

I also see several Kanmusu with their Personality sections blank. So if you have a Kanmusu you'd like to know more about then just mssg me then i'll give it a quick update. (i don't really edit/update translations unless asked to specifically. Yes, i'm lazy <3 )

Hope for the best to all commanders and fleets.
