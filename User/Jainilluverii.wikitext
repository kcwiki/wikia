Started play on 12/08/15 (August 12th, 2015), which is embarrassing to learn after coming back to the game and start playing "seriously" two years later.

<b>[[Satsuki]] is hands-down one of the most amazing girls in the game, and no one can convince me otherwise.</b>

<b>I prefer to play according to my in-game Tagline: "S l o w l y." </b> <s>However, I tend to be quick with Events so I have more time to Farm.</s>

Most edits will be to my own page.
