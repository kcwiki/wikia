Hi, welcome to Malw's profile page!

=='''About me'''==
I started playing Kancolle on February 2015, but I was a bit AFK because I didn't like it a lot.

I started playing seriously after 4 months, so right now I'm a bit low in HQ level.

I'm from Spain and I like collecting figures.

I use KC3 since KCV doesn't translate everything I need
