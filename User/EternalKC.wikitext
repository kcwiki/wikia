== About Me ==
I started playing KanColle just as the Winter 2015 event started. Played way too much during those first two weeks, but somehow managed to clear E-3 on easy and got U-511!

I don't play much outside of events now. But when events do come around, I'm always ready for the '''HARD MODE SALT''', LOL.

Married Taihou ^.^
