My Profile :

just a random moe/kawaii girls lover,gamer,and maybe half-otaku?(d*mn u life,)

currently studying Japanese Language @UNIMA Sulawesi Utara, Indonesia and aiming to be able read Japanese without much trouble (i'm looking at you Kanji-san) and personally i'm interested in Bunpo for now i'm not that good but once i'm graudating from college gonna relearn everything from the start since college "non-Japanese" problem keep appearing one after the other

Favorite Anime : Digimon. why ? idk, i'm just attached to this one,

Favorite Seiyuu : Horie Yui = Touyama Nao > Ogura Yui = Tamura Yukari
