==Summary==
The current proposed shelling formula is the following:

<math>\text{Accuracy Value} = 0.03 + W + \left ( 0.9 + \frac{\sqrt{N_{s}-1}}{50} + \frac{E_{s}}{100} + \frac{1.5 \sqrt{L_{s}}}{100} \right ) \cdot C \cdot F</math>

Where:
* <math>N_{s}</math> is the ship's level
* <math>L_{s}</math> is the ship's luck
* <math>W</math> is the fit bonus or overweight penalty
* <math>E_{s} = \sum^{\text{All Slots}} E_{acc} + E_{m} \sqrt{\bigstar}</math>
**<math>E_{s}</math> is the total accuracy provided by the ship's equipment
**<math>E_{acc}</math> is the equipment's displayed accuracy stat
**<math>E_{m}</math> is the equipment's improvement modifier for accuracy
* <math>C</math> is the morale modifier, which is the following depending on your morale:
** < 20: 0.5
** 20-32: 0.8
** 33-52: 1
** 52 >: 1.2
* <math>F</math> is the formation modifier, which includes the Combined Fleet:
** Line Ahead: 1
** Double Line: 1.2
** Diamond: 1
** Echelon: 1.2
** Line Abreast: 1.2
** Cruising Formation 1 (Anti Sub): ???
** Cruising Formation 2 (Forward): ???
** Cruising Formation 3 (Ring): ???
** Cruising Formation 4 (Battle): ???

Additional notes:
*''Combined Fleet modifiers appear to be flat penalties but are still subject to further investigation.''
*''Incomplete: Effects of AP Shells and Artillery Spotting are yet to be added.''
*''Incomplete: Combined Fleet modifiers are missing.''
