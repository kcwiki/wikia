As time past, rookie teitoku is not a rookie anymore, he also won some respect from the girls under his headquarter, my top ten fleet girls are:
# The Fifth Aviation Division (第五航空戰隊 = 鶴姐妹)
# Shigure (時雨)
# Yuudachi (夕立)
# Murasame (村雨), Shiratsuyu (白露)
# Samidare (五月雨), Suzukaze (涼風)
# Atago (愛宕), Takao (高雄), Maya (摩耶)
# Kongou (金剛), Haruna (榛名)
# Kagerou (陽炎)
# Kisaragi (如月), Mutsuki (睦月)
# Yuubari (夕張)
Current objective: Raise all above girls to their Kai standard, so far Shigure, Yuudachi, Murasame and Shiratsuyu have reached their goal. Thanks for your good work, kiddos! 

Shoukaku and her little sister finally also reached the goal, now you beauties can claim "The best Aviation Fleet" title for real! I, as your commander, will also work harder helping you two to reach the top! 

And eventually Kongou, Atago and Maya also reached their first remodel, oh dear, my fleet is getting stronger! Can't wait to see some SP cut-ins in the future! :D 

 [[File:VAcWH9r.jpg|thumb|311x311px]]- There are some girls I like a lot but won't drop anymore (e.g. Teruzuki), they will not be listed unless they join my fleet in the future. 

Also playing World of Warships, I'm XRRoy with Kongou, Minekaze, Furutaka, Tirpitz, Warspite or Nassau. 

BIG GUNS FOR LIFE!! <3
