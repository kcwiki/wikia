Play Kancolle since 2015, enjoy some salty and joyful moments, usually get misfortune everytime I sortie or during crafting/construct something. Can speak Indonesian and English language, also basic Japanese and German language (still learn a lot though). Also, loveÂ history and engineering stuffs like aircraft.
My favourite ships are Kaga and Kinugasa in terms of personality and ability.
I love Kantai Collection, because this is what makes me found what I truly for.
Anyway, nice to meet you !
