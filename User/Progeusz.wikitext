KantaiDex: Complete

Fall 2014: first event, as two weeks old admiral, I was in HQ40-80 tier. Akizuki and Prinz Eugen rescued.

Winter 2015: E1-E4 Hard clear. E5 Hard was too much for my lv60-80 fleet and mediocre eq. Farmed Shioi and Unryuu on E4 Hard.

Learned basically everything available about game mechanics around this time.

Spring 2015: full Hard clear in two days, ~30k. All girls rescued, all farmed on Hard. Got ~20 new girls, farmed until the last day, obtained every single droppable ship.

Crafted Yamato, first LSC ship, after 42 attempts.

Summer 2015: full  Hard clear. All girls rescued, all farmed on Hard. Two Akitsu Maru. Less than 50k spent over the course of whole month.

Crafted Musashi and Bismarck, total 54 attempts.

Fall 2015: full Hard clear. All girls rescued, Graf on easy, Arashi on Hard.

Crafted Taihou after 23 attempts, KantaiDex complete.
