Hi there, I'm Mystia Lore.

I've took interest in Kantai Collection between Summer 14 and Fall 14 Events, and I've started to play on 2015, July 6th. Maybe my english isn't the best for the roleplay with my naval base, but I hope it will be enough understandable =).
==Currently : Lot of things happened, and future Winter Event==
Destroyer Hime : Why all that heavy defensive system in your office ?<br />Myschin : Because it's Pocky day, right ? [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Tadano_Hitoshi/Ragtag_Hustle_Kancolle_Edition_-_Everyday_Hustle_5_-_Pocky_Madness_%26_Strange_Maya_%26_Fall_Operation_Preparations I remember what happened once to a fellow admiral]...<br />Destroyer Hime : ... This base isn't chaotic as far as I remember.<br />Myschin : What if some girls make an alliance to kidnap me ?<br />Destroyer Hime : You are too paranoid about that...<br />Inazuma, holding a pocky : Awawa-nanodesu, and we have already decided on a order to play the game with you...<br />Myschin : Ok... Ok... I was wrong...<br />Sendai, appearing out of nowhere : GOTCHA admiral, now play the pocky game with us, or night battle with me <3.<br />Myschin : ... How about this ?

The admiral suddenly gives a ring to Sendai.

Sendai : Hu ?!<br />Inazuma, Destroyer Hime : ... ?!<br />Myschin : You didn't see that one coming, didn't you ?<br />Sendai : ... But admiral, do you know what have you done ?<br />Myschin : Yes, I've unleashed an even more stronger ninja.<br />Sendai, blushing : ... Thank you admiral, but now you must have a real night battle with me.<br />Myschin : Later, I promise you.

Inazuma : We did it-nanodesu ! [https://www.twitch.tv/mystialore/v/101439375 We have finally cleared Sav Island].<br />Myschi : It's all thanks to everyone. You can take a rest until the Event start. And somehow The Slot Salmon Sea Area is way easier than Sav Island. We will take our take to clear it anyway. I can't wait for the Event, because it's now 100% official : there will be a french Seaplane Tender to find, and it will probably be Commandant Teste.<br />Mizuho Kai, full Yandere mode : Admiraaaal !! You can't cheat on me with another *** seaplane tender !!<br />Kongou : Woah there, calm down.<br />Mizuho Kai : No. Freakin'. Way ! I'm gonna kill that foreign girl when she will come !<br />Myschin : Yeah yeah...<br />AkitsuShima : You are not afraid ?<br />Myschin : Not at all, Mizuho Kai is too slow to be a real threat because of her turret.<br />Mizuho Kai : Damn it >.< !



Myschin : So here it is, the Fall Event of 2016... I have mixed feelings about it.<br />Inazuma : Why-nanodesu ?<br />Myschin : First, I'm gonna attempt a full Hard Event. Second, the final objective of this Event is to bring back... Miss Saratoga.<br />Ryuujou : ...<br />Myschin : Yeah, even if she's looking nice and kind, you still can't face her right ?<br />Ryuujou : Yeah sorry, it was traumatic for me...<br />Nagato : But admiral, she's a part of the Operation Crossroad...<br />Myschin : I know that too.<br />Prinz Eugen : The light...<br />Sakawa : Don't tell me we will have to face that light again-pyaaa...<br />Myschin : Nah, it won't happen, don't worry. We will find a way to please everyone... But there is already a THIRD problem here.<br />Inazuma : What do you mean ?

Myschin : First map is a Transport Escort AND guess who is the boss this time again ?<br />Shiratsuyu : Submarine Hime-chan ?<br />Myschin : GOD DAMNIT ! I have enough to bully her again and again !<br />Destroyer Hime : Why you don't just invite her to stay in the base ?<br />Myschin : I asked her once, but she prefers her abyssal homeplace. Also, there is some surprises in this map, like Uranami...<br />Isonami : You didn't tried to search her before...<br />Myschin : Because I didn't want to go in Okinoshima Islands for her, but we will search Uranami here... There is also Akizuki and... Hatsuzuki who can be found in the area.<br />Hatsuzuki, shocked : Already ?!<br />Teruzuki : What about me ?! (°A° ) ?!<br />Myschin : I really want to keep another Akizuki and Hatsuzuki.<br />Hatsuzuki : But... Why ?<br />Myschin : Because they are cute when you are still innocent, and you will have another little sister.<br />Hatsuzuki, blushing : Little sister... Auuuu...

Myschin : Now the unexpected new ! Apparently, Yamakaze can be found in E2 and E3...<br />All of the Shiratsuyu-class : Our last sister !<br />Shiratsuyu : Admiral, Yamakaze is a fragile girl in both physical and mental conditions. Please be very patient and kind with her.<br />Myschin : Do not worry... I think she will remain Lv1 if she's too weak.<br />Umikaze : Then, it will be the same case as us.<br />Myschin : Yeah, at worst, we will search for another one later...<br />Shigure : Admiral, please don't forget your promise...<br />Myschin : I won't, you will be the next shipgirl to reach Lv99.

Myschin : And there is my personnal climax of the Event : To rescue Commandant Teste in E3.<br />Shouhou : She's a Reward so we just have to win against the boss, right ?<br />Myschin : Yeah but... We're gonna do it in the Hard way, and it will be a HUGE battle apparently, because it will be 12 VS 12 !<br />Nagatsuki : Woah, we will face some abyssal combined fleets ?!<br />Myschin : It will prepare us for the future when we will reach the 6-5 area.<br />Mizuho Kai, even more yandere than before : Gonna kill this girl...<br />Sendai : Admiral, she's so slow it's not even funny to stop her.<br />Mizuho : Ara ara, such reaction...<br />Myschin : Oh Mizuho... Are you going to be yandere too ?<br />Mizuho : Why would I turn into a Yandere ? This Commandant Teste is still a foreign girl so I will invite her in my drinking club. Now Mizuho Kai, please calm down.<br />Mizuho Kai, still yandere to the core : I will not fall into this trap !

Submarine Hime : IT HURT !! PLEASE STOP !!<br />Myschin, suddenly hugging Submarine Hime : YAY ! You're back now with that voice of yours !<br />Submarine Hime : Spare me please ! I don't have Sakawa !!<br />Myschin : Worry not, we have found everyone we were looking for and we didn't have to sink you to clear the area. Now you can relax until the end of the Event.<br />Submarine Hime : I don't want to come back later !<br />Myschin, giving another hug to Submarine Hime : I can't promise anything to you about that.

Myschin : So, in the end, that E-1 Hard was... Kind of easy. And as I said before, we have found everyone we were looking for...<br />Uranami : Who called me a Potatoe ?! I'm gonna hit them with my anchor !!<br />Isonami : Erm... How about spending time with Ayanami, Shikinami and me ?<br />Uranami : Right, we have a lot of things to talk about...<br />Myschin : And there is also...<br />Loli Akizuki : Uuuuh, I'm hungry...<br />Akizuki : Worry not, you will never starve again in this base.<br />Loli Hatsuzuki : ...<br />Hatsuzuki, blushing : Eh... Ah... So cute...<br />Isuzu, Zuikaku, both nosebleeding : Good job admiral !<br />Loli Zuikaku : Big sis, there is blood coming out of your nose !<br />Shoukaku : Will this be alright ?<br />Myschin : Yeah don't worry. I really wanted to keep them. We will do the same with Teruzuki later.

Kamikaze : Commander ? What is the meaning of this ?<br />Myschin, holding another loli Kamikaze in his hands : Don't you want to have another little sister ?<br />Kamikaze : But I have Harukaze, and there is Asakaze to find, right ?<br />Myschin : Yes, but since you are very cute, I want to keep a loli version of yourself.<br />Loli Kamikaze : Onee-chan, play with me !<br />Kamikaze, blushing : Yes.<br />Myschin : And same goes for Harukaze =)<br />Harukaze : Oh my, this younger version of myself is more adorable than expected !<br />Loli Harukaze : * Deep stare at her elder self * ... ?<br />Sendai, in the back of the admiral : Why did you keep them ?<br />Myschin : Come on, don't worry, the lolis ancient DD won't cause you any trouble... I hope.<br />Sendai : Ths base looks more and more like a kindergarten...

Myschin : How do you feel right now ?<br />Yamakaze : Huuu, I just want to die already...<br />Myschin : Please listen to me Yamakaze, I can see that you don't want to fight on the battlefield.<br />Yamakaze : Don't wanna sortie ! I will sink in an instant !<br />Deumikaze: There there, let me give you a hug.<br />Yamakaze, blushing : Ah... It's warm... Please continue...<br />Myschin : I can hug you too.<br />Yamakaze : Please leave me alone... But...<br />Umikaze : You don't have to fear him Yamakaze, he's totally trustworthy.<br />Harusame : And he will play with you whenever you want ! And he's kind !<br />Harusame Kai : And there is our big sister Shiratsuyu who will take care of you as well.<br />Myschin : I leave Yamakaze to you until she wants more, OK ?<br />All of the Shiratsuyu-class girls : Yes admiral.

Myschin : SO ! I want to adress a big middle finger to all those peoples who still think that you are useless !<br />Nagatsuki, embarrassed : I... I just did what you told me to do admiral...<br />Myschin : Yeah but look, you were part of the team who cleared E-2 in Hard !<br />Nagatsuki : ...<br />Myschin : Considering what you went through, I dare anyone to laugh at you once more. I'll teach them ! ALSO ! Some veterans told me that both of you are pretty weak even if you have a Kai 2.<br />Furutaka : Eh ?<br />Kako, sleeping : * zzz *<br />Myschin : You've done a really great job too.<br />Furutaka, blushing : But... I want to thank you again admiral... Because I'm now even closer to Kako.<br />Myschin : Why don't make a wedding proposal to her ?<br />Furutaka : KYAAAH, it's too fast !<br />Myschin : I'm sorry. Just do it the way you want.<br />Shouhou : Admiral... Thoses planes... Those are from Saratoga, right ?<br />Myschin : Yeah, but they are rather weak. I expected them to be stronger to be honest.

Myschin, shooting with all his rage : WE. HAVE. FREAKIN'. DONE. IT !!<br />Nagatsuki, even more embarrassed than before : Awawa...<br />Myschin : Nagatsuki, you're definitively one of the strongest girls in the base.<br />Nagatsuki : Please stop. I don't deserve all that praise...<br />Myschin : You were a part of the E-3 battle until the end, you managed to sink a BWS all by yourself and you still think that you don't deserve some praise ?<br />Furutaka : Just accept it Nagatsuki, like us...<br />Kako : Yeah, we can be proud of what we have done.<br />Shigure : ... Admiral, I must admit it... I don't understand how you work...<br />Myschin : Because I doubted you ?<br />Shigure : Yes...<br />Myschin : Yeah, I'm sorry about that, but look, in the end, you managed to finish the boss. You are definitively thrustworthy too... And so now, I'm really proud to have rescued Commandant Teste.<br />Commandant Teste : Je vous remercie et je suis désolée amiral, je n'arrive pas à parler correctement la langue locale...<br />Myschin : Je te rassure, parfois j'ai aussi beaucoup de mal. Le français est une langue bien compliquée après tout.<br />Commandant Teste : En tout cas, je vous remercie énormément de votre accueil. Serais-ce à cause du fait que vous ayez des origines françaises que [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/103938121 vous avez joué l'hymne national de la France dans son intégralité à mon arrivée] ?<br />Myschin : Tout à fait. Les américains étaient très fiers d'accueillir Iowa et ils font de même pour Saratoga. Alors pourquoi je me priverais de le faire avec toi ?<br />Commandant Teste : D'ailleurs amiral, j'ai pu rencontrer cette Mizuho Kai. Elle avait l'air en colère au début...<br />Myschin : Et au final, elle est plus que ravie que tu la considère comme une personne dont il faut suivre l'exemple...<br />Mizuho Kai, sparkling : So sorry admiral !<br />Myschin : It's fine, it's fine... Now you have to teach Commandant Teste all the goods sides of the Seaplanes Tenders. I count on you.

Myschin : Now let's talk SERIOUSLY. Since I was assigned as an admiral in this base. My main goal was to have fun and to let you live a peaceful life, right ?<br />All of the shipgirls : Yes admiral.<br />Myschin : We all agree that the E-peen medal is a reward reserved to those who work hard to fight the abyssals ?<br />All of the shipgirls : Yes admiral.<br />Myschin : I don't take things seriously, I train more the shipgirls that I like rather than the shipgirls I should need. I'm taking the whole thing lightly ! I don't search glory, I just want to take pleasure in what I do. And what give me pleasure is to gather datas about the farming part.<br />All of the shipgirls : ...<br />Myschin : SO ! Screw the glory or pride. I'll only do Medium or Hard in futures Event only if it worth the effort and depending on the rewards. For that E-4 right now ? Does it worth all the pain we suffered in the TP Transport phase ? No. Sending Akatsuki and Fubuki as AACI ship was an error. Teruzuki wasn't prepared for all of this...<br />Teruzuki : Eheheh, sorry (°v°")<br />Myschin : Please don't apology for this.<br />Harusame Kai : Admiral... You saw my panties too much time you know ?<br />Myschin : I'm really sorry about that.<br />Harusame Kai : But you know, since it's you, I don't mind at all <3<br />Myschin : ...<br />Murasame : Hey hey Harusame, it's MY job to seduce the admiral...<br />Harusame Kai : Do you have a problem with this, NEE-SAN ?<br />Murasame, panicking : Not at all !!<br />Aircraft Carrier Hime : Please stop all this teasing. I am worried again you know ?!<br />Myschin : Like always.<br />Aircraft Carrier Hime : Seriously, I wanted to see how much did you progress since our very first meeting.<br />Myschin : And you got your answer. If I cleared the E-4 in Easy, it's because I didn't want to fight you with all I have. I'm not ready for this and you are among the strongest himes around.<br />Aircraft Carrier Hime : OK, but please come and see me in 6-5 later please, otherwise I will worry again !

Myschin : And, for the last part. An area that bring back a lot of traumas for some of you...<br />Nagato : Operation Crossroad, the light, the flame...<br />Sakawa, Prinz Eugen : ...<br />Myschin : I must admit that you were very courageous to take part in that operation despite your lack of skill at the beginning.<br />Sakawa : Because, because I can show you that I can be useful too ! Your intense research for me back in the Winter wasn't for nothing.<br />Myschin : That's true.<br />Prinz Eugen : And now I will have the pride to tell Bismarck onee-sama that I faced my worst trauma and now I am a big girl !<br />Myschin : You can relax now, it's over.<br />Nagato : Admiral, I understand your choice about the fleet, but you could have let me go at once in the area, don't you think ?<br />Myschin : Yes, I'm sorry about that, but I really wanted to farm this area in order to find more Pola, Prinz and some girls like Hatsukaze.<br />Nagato : Do you think it's because of the fact that I didn't went in the area, for that you found 32 other myself ?<br />Myschin : I always have some kind of back luck. Some of my friends even called it the "Myschin curse", for find too much Nagatos in few sorties.<br />Maya : Ah, but we met again with Light Cruiser Oni.<br />Myschin : Yeah, I didn't go see her live concerts too often so she was mad against me, I can understand her.<br />Destroyer Hime : Nakano is a sensitive girl too.<br />Myschin : And there was the boss herself, Emrakul.<br />Abyssal Jellyfish Hime : HEY ! Please stop with that nickname ! Only you alone called me like that.<br />Myschin : Well, you DO look like her a little.<br />Asakaze : JUST WAIT A MINUTE YOU CADDISH ! You totally forgot about me !!<br />Myschin : But we found you at the SECOND battle at the boss node...<br />Asakaze : Yeah yeah, but I feel left behind.<br />Myschin : It's just an impression.<br />Kamikaze, holding Loli-Kamikaze : Oooh, another little sister !<br />Asakaze : Eeeh ? There is 2 Kami-Onee ?<br />Harukaze, holding Loli-Harukaze : Oh my, don't forget us too ufufu.<br />Asakaze, confused : Am I drunk or what ?!<br />Myschin : Actually not, it's just a selfish desire of my own to keep 2 of the same.

Later, in the admiral's office, without anyone other person in.<br />Saratoga : Do you hate me ?<br />Myschin : I can't say that I hate you, but I have a problem with the fact that you are part of the US Navy.<br />Saratoga : I guess Iowa's arrival was akward...<br />Myschin : Pretty much yes.<br />Saratoga : May I ask where she is now ?<br />Myschin : She's currently in her homeland. Even if it's highly not sure, I can call her back whenever I want.<br />Saratoga : So... You're not gonna dispose of me ?<br />Myschin : Nah, I don't like US Navy, but I'm not a monster too. You are still shipgirls like the others. So, I have a deal for you.<br />Saratoga : Eh ?<br />Myschin : I realise that Christmas is soon. And I'll probably going to my mentor's base for the new year. Why I propose to you is to go to Iowa's place, until I will call both of you back for Christmas and New Year. And, I have something else.<br />Saratoga : Something else ?<br />Myschin : I'll let your fellow comrades from Operation Crossroad to come with you until your return.<br />Saratoga : You mean ?<br />Myschin : Yep, Nagato, Sakawa and Prinz Eugen.<br />Saratoga : ...<br />Myschin : You don't need to worry, they already accepted this.<br />Saratoga : You're very kind, thank you very much admiral.

Destroyer Hime : I see that Ancient Destroyer Hime can cause you some problems.<br />Myschin : Hum yeah, but the reports are so stranges. Why Pola is "only" on A-Rank and not S too ?<br />Destroyer Hime : The usual announcement from the Headquarters I guess ?<br />Myschin : Probably... Anyways, a search has come to an end.<br />Kagerou : Yes indeed, thank you so much admiral !<br />Hatsukaze : I can * STARE * at you for so much time you will pray for me to stop.<br />Myschin : I don't mind.<br />Hatsukaze : Also please explain why Myoukou-oneesama is only Lv27 while her hot-blooded sister is Lv99.<br />Myschin : Because personal preferences and... Wait, how did you know the level of Myoukou ?!<br />Hatsukaze, deep stare : I KNOW about the game.<br />Naka : Whoah, playing with the fourth wall is dangerous you know ?!

Myschin : The Event have finally ended... And we failed to found a second Yamakaze.<br />Zuikaku : Yes admiral, but apparently nobody reported to have found her a second time.<br />Myschin : I remember that someone showed to have found 2 Umikaze back in the Summer 15 but oh well, we can wait until her next appearence...<br />Yamakaze, clumsily hiding behind Deumikaze : It means that I will have to sortie ?!<br />Myschin : Of course not.<br />Yamakaze, tears in the eyes : I'll rather kill myself instead of sortieing even once !<br />Deumikaze, patting Yamakaze's head : Calm down, calm down. The admiral promised he will not sortie you at all and he will keep it. Now come with me, let's go play with your sisters.<br />Yamakaze : Yay...<br />Myschin : (So cute !) Oh yeah, let's now talk about that hot news that came out of nowhere.<br />Shoukaku : The Jets ?<br />Myschin : Yeah. Why now ? Headquarters didn't say anything about them coming now.<br />Zuikaku : They do have say they would come this year ?<br />Myschin : I don't know, but now I fear for the future Events. Also, it seems that now Headquarters likes to let us choose a reward between severals... I don't know if it's a good idea...<br />Zuikaku : At least you can get now a free Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai.<br />Myschin : Thoses jets also raise another old debate.<br />Shoukaku : Oh, you mean... About our potentials Kai 2 ?<br />Myschin : Yes...<br />Zuikaku : Please don't worry too much about this admiral. We will see about that later, the quests won't escape or disappear at the next announcement.

At the admiral's mentor's naval base.

Suna : Thank you for coming in my place again.<br />Myschin : Nah, thank you for inviting me for the New Year.<br />Suna : We won't do much things... Maybe some cleaning stuff<br />Inazuma : It's very cold...<br />Suna's Yuugumo : Yes indeed, Winter is here after all.<br />Suna : There will be some Yukata assignment, and new year quests...<br />Myschin : This time, I'm almost ready for any of thoses, unless it involve World 6 again.<br />Suna : I'm surprised you bring EVERYONE.<br />Myschin : What do you mean ?<br />Suna : You brough even Iowa...<br />Iowa, blushing : Eheh... Eeeeh... Well...<br />Myschin : I made an exception for this trip. It's not everytime I can come here.

Suna's I-8 : Happy new year everyone, here is the list of the shipgirls who got a yukata assignment.<br />Myschin : * Please let Umikaze and Deumikaze have one ! *<br />Suna : * Please let Samidare have one ! *<br />Suna's I-8 : Let me cut the suspense; There is no Yukata for Umikaze or Samidare.<br />Myschin, Suna : DAMNIT !<br />Suna's I-8 : Everyone from last year can officially wear a Yukata again, and for the news one... There is Houshou...<br />Myschin : Meh...<br />Suna's I-8 : Iowa...<br />Everyone else : WHAT ?!<br />Iowa : Oh...<br />Suna's Iowa : Isn't that GREAT ?!<br />Suna's I-8 : And finally, there is... Yamakaze.<br />Yamakaze : Eh ?<br />Myschin, deep stare at Yamakaze : ...<br />Yamakaze, blushing very bright : I'll kill myself if you stare that much !!<br />Suna's Yamakaze : Daddy... What do you think ?<br />Suna, Myschin, both nosebleeding : * Damn, so cute ! *<br />Suna : We will protect you !!<br />Suna's Yuugumo, stare at his admiral : Ufufufu.<br />Suna : Uuugh.<br />Suna's I-8 : And there is one last yukata... For the Northern Ocean Hime.<br />Everyone : ...<br />Suna's Shoukaku : And there will be a quest in the 3-5 map.<br />Myschin : Damnit, they want to force us to bully the abyssal again ?!<br />Destroyer Hime : ... I'm jealous. I want a yukata too !<br />Suna : Look at the bright side, you can even get a Shiun.<br />Myschin : That's very nice indeed.

Northern Ocean Hime : GO HOME ! And please give me a Reppuu !<br />Myschin : Well, I want to apologize to you. The last time with Kako was an accident...<br />Northern Ocean Hime : Meanie ! GO HOME !<br />Myschin : WAIT WAIT ! This time, we don't have to fight !<br />Northern Ocean Hime : ...<br />Myschin : Zuikaku, please give her a Reppuu.<br />Zuikaku, sighing : You're too kind admiral.<br />Northern Ocean Hime : Yay ! A Reppuu ! I can play planes now !!

While the fleet leave, Nagato took a last look at the young abyssal hime playing with her new toy.

Myschin : Nagato ?<br />Nagato : Admiral, I wasn't thinking of anything twisted OK ?!<br />Myschin : I didn't such a thing !<br />Nagato : She reminds me Sakawa.<br />Myschin : I just hope this time, Seaport Hime won't be mad at me...

Suna : Ok Myschin, here is one last thing before you leave.<br />Myschin : This is... The Vita version of Kancolle.<br />Suna : Yes, remember that you asked for it a long time ago ?<br />Myschin : Yes... I'll keep it sealed until maybe someday. I still don't have the device to use it.<br />Suna : Well, it's all up to you, but remember that the Headquarter erased all existence of it?<br />Myschin : I don't care, it's still another proof that nobody can be perfect, such as the manga Side:Kongou.

Myschin : Great, girls, you are awesome.<br />Asashimo : Oh come on, it was just a single raid in 5-4.<br />Myschin : Yes, but now the area is cleared and World 6 is open to us.<br />Destroyer Hime : Don't forget there is world 5-5 too <3<br />Myschin : Glups...<br />Arashio : Admiral~, with my Kai 2 come a quest that require ME and a sister of mine to go to that 5-5 area~<br />Myschin, panicking : NO. FREAKIN'. WAY !! Even the veterans have difficulties to deal with 5-5 with CVB and Yamato-class, and now Headquarters ask us to go with DESTROYERS ?!

Somewhere in the 5-5 area.<br />Re-class Battleship, sneezing : ... Somebody talk about me I guess. I can't wait for them to come ! Then it gonna be a great party !!

Myschin : With this, all we can do is pretty much waiting for the next Event to come, and try crafting some LSC ship sometimes when we hit max resources everywhere.<br />Kongou : HEY Admiral, tahnk you for bringing me to Lv 99 ! Now I can stand against Fusou.<br />Myschin : Please don't do that this much... I don't want to deal with the dark side of Fusou again.<br />Nagatsuki : Are you sure about your choice admiral ?<br />Myschin : Yes Nagatsuki, I have finally made my choice. Between you and Shiratsuyu, you will be the next.<br />Nagatsuki, blushing : I... I don't deserve this...<br />Myschin : Of course yes. I hope to give you the ring for Valentine Day.<br />Nagatsuki, still blushing : Hawawawa...<br />Inazuma : That's my line.
