2nd Wikia account, since I used to log in with Facebook, until abandon it :V.

Grinding Kantai Collection since August 16th of 2017.

Ultimate goal as Teitoku... Seeing Ikazuchi, Inazuma, Shikinami, Kuma, Tokitsukaze, Amatsukaze, Prinz. E, one ducky and Taihou Kai ni'd... (... ANd, Shimakaze, with slight differences in relation to base :V)

[https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Hiei Hiei]/[https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Zuikaku Zuikaku]/[https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Kitakami Kitakami]-sama best characters :3. 

(... grew to like and appreciate [annoying, but likeable?] [https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Ryuujou Ryuujou], around May 2018)

Ultimate goal as TTK completed: 1) Shikinami Kai Ni'd! (February-2020)


Last entry in this profile 18/04/2020 (for now).Entering in a hiatus for indeterminate time, due to university and job (in the worst time possible, worldwide quarentine...)

I only regret not seeing Hiei's third remodel. Inazuma's, Ikazuchi, Kuma, Prinz E, one ducky and Taihou's Kai ni.

Papa bless this western Kantai community, my senpais in it, frontliners and this dying game in which made me a lot of company, being a "auto-played" entertainment. Best wishes for all of you that still believes in the developers.

To my beloved ship girls, thanks for everything, my very favorites are still the same, I practically never hated/disliked any character, and hopefully we'll get to see more of you animated in future anime projects :). <3.
