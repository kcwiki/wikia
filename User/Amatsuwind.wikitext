I've been around Kancolle for a long time, but I never actually played it until July 2015. The main reason being that Amatsukaze was rare to get and playing the game without my favorite Kanmusu felt pretty hollow to me.

After friends constantly saying I couldn't like her because I didn't even have her, I decided it was time to stop quitting before even trying and give Kancolle a go. 

I started my journey with high hopes and rushed all the way to 3-5, but the difficulty of the map for an HQ level 60 ttk easily crushed my dreams and rekt my fleet.

Lucky for me, my friend told me that there would be an event which means rare ships can be obtained through these alternate maps. Unlucky for me he said it would most likely be a very hard event for new teitokus like me.

August 12th 2015 was the day I finally met my Amatsukaze, but that doesn't mean that I'll stop here. We've still got a long way to go, but each day is something to look forward to now that I'm with Amatsukaze!
