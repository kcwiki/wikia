During the time I started the number of the ship girl in the game aren't big. My starter is Fubuki and she still one of my favorite destroyer, her main job now is became the Flagship of Tokyo Express because her high level (70).

My first Light Cruiser (including Torpedo Cruiser) is probably Kiso. Though I she haven't caught my interest until I know that she is very powerfull once she reach Kai Ni. Torpedo Cruisers are very powerfull in my opinion. Ooi and Kitakami mainly join in my PvP and clearing lots of hellish map. I have reward them with rings. :3 (Kiso won't get her ring, but I will level her 99)

I played Kancolle because of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio ~Ars Nova~. I really like both Heavy Cruiser that being featured in the show, Takao and Maya. Alas, I missed the Kancolle x Arpeggio event and didn't have the chance to see them. Maya is my first Heavy Cruiser, she become one of the main ship at first because of her battle performance. Eventhough she isn't one of the main ship now (because of Myoukou and Haguro), she always have place in my heart.

Haruna, also one of the ship featured in Arpeggio which I love the most, is my first battleship. Her voice is really cute. She is the one who I gave the ring from the quest. She is always become of the clearing team (in map that didn't prohibit BB), from the 1-3 until now 6-2. She always participate in 2-5 with her sisters or heavy cruiser. In Extra Operation 3-5 now, she become the only Battleship when I am using Hoppu route. I haven't cleared 5-5 because I don't think it is worthy enough. Though recently, I finally kill the boss once using Haruna, Kirishima, Hiei, Hiryuu, Soryuu, and Zuikaku. The drop is Present Box, I think I will keep it because it is like a gift from Haruna and it is the only present box I got.
