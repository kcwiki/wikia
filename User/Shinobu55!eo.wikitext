==Operation 1-5==
<br /> 
<strike>I use Line Abreast all the time, except on the first node. There I use Echalon Formation to increase survivalrate (damn trollsub). If you don't have sufficent Akitsumaru planes, you should use Saiun instead to disable Red-T, but in my case red t doesn't matter because the boss sinks anyway.</strike><br />
Thanks to preempitve strike to subs it doesn't matter anymore. Just pick Echalon or Line abreast for damage improvement. Akitsumaru planes are nice, but not probably don't matter on this map anymore. 
<br /><br />
Formation: 2x DD/CL (with asw value above 100/isuzu kai ni, to get preemptive strike), 1x CVL, 1x BBV

I usally go for Echalon on Night Battle nodes, if I have no Intention of sinking the whole abyssal fleet. Everything else is line ahead.

Sadly it has no 100% routing, but it nearly branching north on the first node nearly never happened to me. Makes it a lot easier to reach the boss via south route.

I normally don't use buckets on eo besides 5-5, therefore I need a backup composition to clear this eo quicker.
