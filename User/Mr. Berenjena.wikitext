Kongo was the reason what it makes me want to play KC on 2014 but i actually started to play since fall 2017.

-  Kongo Lvl 150+



~ My first event was winter 2018, Leyte pt.2 and i still don't know how i cleared all maps and get my lovely Intrepid, the cool Ark Royal, Richelieu, Saratoga, Tashkent and Akizuki, but the most important thing is, Iowa droped and i don't even knew she exist. I was lucky, i guess.

~ I started the ranking thing on late summer-early fall 2018 event, after the overhaul to html5, when i cleared the event. Since then, im a top100 ranker on Lingga server, but sometimes im a t500 and t20 on July 2019... and never gonna do that thing again, seriously.

~ The first last map hard clear was the Atlanta event, Fall 2019 and it's all thanks to the mighty Nelson-Kirishima-Hiei snipe touch.
