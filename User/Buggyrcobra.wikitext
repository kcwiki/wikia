Hey, I'm Buggyrcobra. I'm from Australia. My interests include manga, Touhou, and Kantai Collection.

I love to study history, and I'm very interested in modern history. Also, thanks to Kancolle, I now like to learn about the IJN and other navies such as the USN, RN and RAN.  

My favourite ship class is probably destroyer. They are quite versatile and simple to make and repair. I also don't mind how many there are, I just kinda like collecting them and then feeding most of them to my other ship girls :V
