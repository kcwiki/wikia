{{FitData
|date = 26-09-2017
|ship = Richelieu
|lvl = 98

|morale = Normal
|acc = 0

|CL1 = 1882
|CL2 = 306
|hit = 93.91%
|calculated = 99.80%
|difference = (-5.89%)
|note = If we are going to assume 46cm gives -10 penalty, then we also have to assume class A has a 4-5 fit bonus on Richelieu. Assuming +4 on 35.6cm due to being more common.

|note = Assuming 46cm is -10, the fit bonus is assumed to be around 2-3. Minor deviation from the proposed class A, more concrete proof needed if I want to disprove 30.5cm guns having the same fit as Class A guns.
