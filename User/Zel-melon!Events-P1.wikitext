This event is a mix. It reeks of poor ship-tag and stupid historical buff, but better gimmick design. It is a blessing that enough warning was given to determine how to get the Nishimura tag instead of Kurita tag in E-2. Then there's this Casual Difficulty, which must be elaborate. It is not casual as in "game so easy you can just finish it while farting". Remember, this game has map rewards, and if you can obtain the final ship easily then what is the point? It is why Casual is pretty much "Very easy" and most fresh meat should be able to clear till E-4.

E-1 is a sub map, moving on! E-2 is where the fun starts. If you screw up the Nishimura tag it will be more annoying but doable. Honestly, you don't even need Nishimura fleet for Nishimura route this time. Sink the boss and carry on!

E-3 is actually an odd-ball, the tag is only used once and most of the ships that participated are your heavy power CVs, which can make this either really easy or strangely hard. However, nothing much here, it's just a bauxite sink.

E-4 is where everyone meet their first wall. So-class wall is no joke. Ru-Kai wall is no joke. And the infamous 6 Ru-wall will block you even at Casual. The boss itself is pretty much another wall of pain with her armor being ridiculously high. This is where the issue of Historical buff first comes in because of how helpful it will be.

E-5 is TP + HP map where it's just resource sink, moving on!

E-6 is where the pain train starts. First boss has a cancerous routing but easy boss. Second boss has decent route but annoying boss. Final boss is the combination of the first two. Just pray, and hope you have some Toukai to deal with subs.

E-7 has Phase 1. Phase 2 is just there for Medium/Hard. But for Easy....ho boi....Easy is actually harder because you don't have buff. Talking about some design decision. However Medium/Hard is where people starts to question the historical buff. The historical buff did not make the map easier, it becomes the core reason for you to clear the map. This problem is there in E-4 and E-6 too but nowhere near what was shown in E-7. This is because the gimmick did not debuff the enemy's fleet, it buff historical fleets. 

Now, what part of the gimmick design is better? Air Raid requirement is now just AS. That's a fucking blessing compared to "No-damage". Oh wait, the AS requirement is pretty high. Well, still controllable compared to the "no-damage" shit.

Overall, I enjoyed the event enough to let it pass but I need to question my feeling if I want to continue. I'm waiting for you, Phase II. Tashkent best girl (yes, I'm Yadokari fag). Jervis is mini Kongou. Gambei is bei. And the other three are there I guess.

See you guys in Phase II!

The event was bailed on 3rd December 2017, 9 days before the end of the event due to real life issue. As such, Easy was done to cut-loss. 

I ain't going to sugarcoat this shit; this is one of the worst and best event I've ever experienced. The complexity of the map is too much when you realize that we just came out of a Large-scale event. Also, the 'scale' of an event is officially dead. The presence of "phases" renders 'scale' meaningless as this event is a pretty much Small-Large-scale event.

However, I do enjoy the thematic of Nishimura fleet UNTIL the final boss, which I believe is a slap in the face to the Nishimura fleet as it feels out of nowhere. If the event ended with Strait Hime, I would consider this event dedicated to Historical enough (seriously, that final lines from them are great. It made me regret not continuing Hard a bit) to let it go but nope...now I shall complain about the 6-Nishimura requirement for Hard Mode (instead of 4 or 5) being the stupidest requirement ever. Also, Perfect LBAS as the requirement to unlock E-3H is stupid.

Z6 is the most cancerous path of this event, similar to E7 of the previous event in a small package. You better pray hard. The real issue is S-ranking it. A-rank would solve a lot of problems.

However, the worst of the worst must go to the 6-Nishimura requirement for Hard, hands down. You can say that they warned us early and that we should have prepared for it, but most would expect 4, 5 at worst, not 6. 6 locks out too many players who don't have either Asagumo or Yamagumo; yes, they are farmable, but how horrible does it feel to be told that you need to go farm some ship first just to unlock the boss node? This is not an "A certain ship makes the map easier"; this is "You must have this ship to unlock the boss". It is disgusting. Luckily, they still had some sense to have the requirement for Easy as 0 (or 2 if you come from the south route) and Medium as 3.

This event is quite friendly for Medium and Easy players despite its brutal map phases. It is a wise decision for them to make most of the Medium and Hard rewards similar due to how historical-dependent many of these maps are.

Nevertheless, I shall pay them my respect by using all 7 of them for 1st LD (no, LD for AA-hime does not deserve it). Respect is totally only for these girls, not related to real history.

I didn't give up on E7H. This one, I didn't bother. E-6 is the most boring map they have ever made so far. Even worse than E-1.
