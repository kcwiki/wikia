==Info:==

So far I have....6 Hard Mode Medals (Summer 2016, Fall 2016, (not Winter 2017, damn you last map ship lock!) Spring 2017, Summer 2017, not Fall 2017 (fuck that Event and especially not Winter 2018. Fuck that event²), Early Fall 2018 and Winter 2019. That's already pretty much it from the luck-depraved "Ima get fuck all during farming" TTK from Germany.

* '''Left Behind''': Kaiboukan Nr.4
* '''General Thoughts:'''
'''E1:'''

A Submarine map like any other with a rather small DD Fleet and a sub as final boss. I have no recollection about this map and it's quite forgettable

'''E2:'''

Installation Map more or less, not much to do but to blast the first Installation boss and the straight on to the final boss. Battleship Water Demon to soak up damage but the Wo-Class that has to sink does just that quite well.

'''E3:'''

A bit of unlocking and straight on to the Map Boss. Retreated once or twice but overall nothing really happened. The mix of Submarine and surface fleet at boss was a bit annoying.

'''E4:'''

Ho boy. I did it on Medium as the rewards for hard were...basically non-existent. But even though the map was tedious with 2 Bosses before the final one and unlocking everything was more or less smooth sailing. Only preboss Node was extremely annoying with a Re-Class being there. Till final Boss LD it was alright. However after that I have seen the most bullshit RNG since...well..last Event. It got so bad that I dopped to easy as even with Debuff I was unable to get her to sink with such RNG as entire Yasen fleet dealing 8 damage total while none being even Chuuha.

'''E5:'''

So much unlocking. I even forgot there was a CL Princess you dealt with. Nothing much happened, around 2 retreats maybe but pretty easy..it was on Normal Mode after all.

'''E6:'''

First Boss was so annoying. The Night Battle Node was really a cockblock and after unlocking the shortcut for the final Boss it became more manageable and the boss itself did not pose much of a problem and was done in 4 LD attempts. However that was probably due to merciful RNG as I has everything from daytime S-Ranks to D-Ranks.

'''E7:'''

This map... the rewards were absolut trash and the only options were Hard or Easy. However this map, the final map of a large scale Event (and as we know large scale back then may have been L, but todays ones are XXXL) having a lock on its own, 3 even, made me do easy as the rewards were pretty bad. So easy on Easy and I killed the boss undebuffed on accident. It was just tedious to unlock everything. On Hard however it seems to be absolute hell, especially Boss 2.

'''Conclusion:'''

Drops were quite good, rewards could be better, especially for the final map. E7-H should not have had any shiplocks on its own. 

Overall: Tedious unlocking was too much and some bosses were completely unreasonable.
