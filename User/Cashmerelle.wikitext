Personal Info

Last Updated: 26/09/16

Hi! I'm known as Sarah, Cashmere or Candi. I'm most active on the utaite wiki, though I spend most of my time in the Touken Ranbu wiki chat.

I love games but I'm not very good at them. I love writing and drawing and have many interests and fandoms. Too many to list.

For info about me in-game (Kancolle, Touken Ranbu, etc) please visit my page on that wiki!

Kancolle Info

Last Updated: 26/09/16

I am HQ level 100. I still need 24 ships, the ones I want the most including Bismarck, Warspite, Iowa and Aquila. My highest level ship is Haruna at 93. I am steadily working on leveling up many ships at once. I log in almost every day. I have 11 wedding rings, and intend to marry Amagi, Katsuragi, Akatsuki, Hibiki, Ooi, Kitakami, Abukuma, Kumano, Suzuya, Kongou and Haruna. Working on leveling them up now! I love all my shipgirls, and even to narrow down to a few favourites would be difficult. My starter was Murakumo.
