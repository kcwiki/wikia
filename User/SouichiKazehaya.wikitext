Just call me Souichi; Shutenjin was just something I came up with off the top of my head. In fact, I don't even remember why I chose that name at all. Either way, it's nice to meet you.<br /><br />Player Status: Semi-Active (school gets in the way a bit, but I'm doing what I can. ~_~)<br />
Unique Shipgirls: Approx. 93 with Chitose/Chiyoda duplicates<br />
Married to: Kongou<br />

Below is something that will likely always remain a work in progress...tread here, if you want to read something silly. (For the purposes of any biographies, the Admiral is Jinguji Masato.)

Fleet Leader / Secretary Ship: Kongou (LV100+)<br />

She needs no introduction at this point. She's loud, she's energetic, and she's captured Admiral Masato's heart in a flash, more or less. When off-duty, she often clings to him like a leech -- though he doesn't mind it, and even welcomes it, it does get a little bothersome when he has to take care of upper-brass affairs.<br /><br />
Fleet Sub-Leaders / Substitute Secretaries: Traditionally, this role goes to one of four other ships, taking Kongou's place: Haruna, Nagato, Akagi, and Kaga. Recently, however, Kirishima has begun filling in this role as well, and as of September, Taihou has as well. Masato dreads the day he has to let Hiei fill in this spot...<br />[[File:151 Card.jpg]][[File:BB Nagato Kai 275 Card.jpg]][[File:CV Akagi Kai 277 Card.jpg]][[File:CV Kaga Kai 278 Card.jpg]][[File:152.jpg]][[File:CVB Taihou Kai 156 Card.jpg]]<br>
Kaga is silently appreciative of how committed he is to his work, though there's a lingering sentiment that he needs to stop letting Kongou be so clingy, especially when they're supposed to be on duty. Not that it keeps him from doing exactly that, even when the order is given. Akagi, being Kaga's counterbalance, often has to tell her to just relax, since it's not as if he's hurting anyone.<br><br>
Nagato, meanwhile, often lays out the groundwork, and is significantly more no-nonsense towards him than Kongou is. Even though she does have her moments of tranquility, it's often up to the prideful, stern battleship to make sure things get done in the Admiral's office.<br><br>Kirishima, while having a little more common sense than Kongou, often says things that flabbergast Masato -- such as giving something a hard whack when equipment isn't up to snuff. This has led him to believe all of the Kongou sisters are, to put it lightly, 'a little loopy'. Haruna's presence in his office slowly changed that, though -- as she proves to be the most grounded of the four of them, even humble and apologetic for their behavior.
