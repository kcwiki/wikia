Mwuhahahaha. I am the mad scientist, Jebediah Kerman!

If you're reading this page, you're either dying of boredom or drowning in a sea of salt. Anyway, welcome!

(Well, since this page is still a WIP, there probably won't be anything worth looking at here. Just don't waste your time reading this and move along. Maybe go level up your ships and prepare for the next event if you haven't yet #JUSTDOIT)

Some info about myself:

- A really shitty and lazy TTK from the Kanoya Airfield. Been rolling around the naval district since Spring 2014.

- Currently HQLv98 but still single due to laziness and generally not bothering to level up the fleet (ikr...)

- Tried to save pudding from the abyssals since news of her appearance first arrived. After multiple failures during every event, sanity is broken and left the wikia community for around half a year. Returned as of the Summer 2016 event and finally succeeded as of 22nd August 2016. Sanity restored.

- Tried to save Warspite during the Summer 16 event but failed by getting stuck on E3 due to the twin Summer Dysons and finally running out of fuel/buckets. (Lesson learned: DO NOT attempt events without stockpiling buckets) Darn. The next time she is sighted, I will be prepared with a whole combat-ready fleet coupled with sufficient resources!

- blah blah blah blah etc.

(Wait, how come I was logged out during the last edit and it was somehow still working? Dafuq?)
