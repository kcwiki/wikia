Last update 7-5-2015. Right after Spring Event 2015

I joined the Wikia on 5'th of December 2014 because I was trying to get into Kancolle but I was curious if there was a chat or anything for it. Then I went googling and I found this comment on the Wikia of [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User:ArcticaFrost ArcticaFrost ] saying to some anon to create an account and join the chat. So I did that and I happen to have a great first day in there despite still not being in the game. The next day I joined the Lottery and got in. The same day I spend in the Wikia chat to get to know people and well.... that's how I made some amazing friends there :3.

A little list of ships I'm still hoping to get.
