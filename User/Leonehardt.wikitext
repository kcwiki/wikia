I'm a big fan of Kantai Collection. Though I couldn't remember all the ship girls since there are too many of them.

I really like Hoppou. (Please join my fleet. I'll give you the Zero)

Also I have FanFiction account and I've been an author since 2014, but I deleted some of my stories. Anyway, I'm currently focusing on my Kancolle FanFic which is about my take on the Abyssals as sunken ship girls with the focus on Fubuki and Mutusuki (and the female Admiral)
