Quests are categorized into seven types.
*Quests, like [[Expedition]]s, can be a great way to gather resources.
*Completing quests may also reward rare equipment, ships, and one-time-use items.
*[[File:Quests-Page-Info-Picture.png|500px]]
<br />
To activate a quest, simply click on it and an orange icon will appear to the right of the quest.
*This means that the quest has yet to be completed and your progress is being tracked.
*[[File:Quests-Page-Info-Picture-2.png|500px]]
**'''You can only have 5 quests active at any given time'''
**However, completing [[#D18|Quest D18]] will reward a [[File:Headquarters Personnel.png|30px]] '''Headquarters Personnel''' which, once consumed, will permanently increase your active quest limit to 6.
**The maximum active quest limit can be checked in your admiral profile page.
<br />
When you satisfy all the requirements of a quest, the orange icon will turn blue.
*This means that the quest has been completed and you can collect your rewards.
*[[File:Quests-Page-Info-Picture-4.png|500px]]
**[[File:Quest composition.png|30px|link=#Composition Quests (編成)]] Composition quests are completed upon organizing the correct fleet (Most will be organized in your first fleet).
**[[File:Quest sortie.png|30px|link=#Sortie Quests (出撃)]] Sortie quests should be activated '''before''' sortieing, and as long as you met the correct requirements, you will have accomplished the quest.
**[[File:Quest expedition.png|30px|link=#Expedition Quests (遠征)]] Expedition quests require that the quest be active upon '''return''' of the expedition fleet. If the quest is inactive when the fleet returns, it will not count towards your progression.
**[[File:Quest building.png|30px|link=#Arsenal Quests (工廠)]] Arsenal and [[File:Quest supply.png|30px|link=#Supply / Docking Quests (補給/入渠)]] Supply quests are evaluated immediately upon performing an action such as building, docking or resupplying. There is no need to keep these quests active while the timer counts down.
***For scrapping quests, you cannot scrap more than one equipment ([[#F12|Like F12]]). You have to scrap each individually for it to count towards progression.
***For resupply quests, the fastest way to complete them is to resupply ships one-by-one and by one type of resource at a time (i.e. two resupplies for one ship). Full fleet resupplies only count as one.
<br />
Some quests are repeatable and reset after a specific time interval.
*'''Daily''' quests reset everyday at 05:00 JST. 
*'''Weekly''' quests reset every Monday at 05:00 JST. 
*'''Monthly''' quests reset on the first day of each month at 05:00 JST.
*'''Daily, weekly, and monthly quests are deactivated when reset occurs'''
<br />
'''For a complete list of ships required by quests, please visit [[List of ships required by quests and expeditions|here]]'''
<br><br>
'''You can mouseover a ship's name to display its picture.''' This feature can be [[Template:LinkImageTooltip#How_To_Disable_It|disabled]] if you wish to do so.

Limited-time quests (e.g. [[Seasonal/Hishimochi_2015|Hishimochi]], [[Summer 2015 Event]]) are not included on this page.

== Notes ==

* When a quest requires specific ship in Base, Kai or Kai Ni form, higher forms (Kai, Kai Ni, Kai Ni A for Base form, Kai Ni, Kai Ni A for Kai form, Kai Ni A for Kai Ni form) also count, unless specified otherwise.
* Some quests have identical titles, you should look at descriptions (see [http://wikiwiki.jp/kancolle/?%C7%A4%CC%B3 here]) to distinguish them:
** [[#B17|B17]] and [[#Bm2|Bm2]] both titled {{SpanJa|「潜水艦隊」出撃せよ！}}
** Model conversion quests (rare equipment is used): [[#F13|F13]], [[#F14|F14]], [[#F15|F15]], [[#F19|F19]], [[#F24|F24]] and [[#F25|F25]] all titled {{SpanJa|機種転換}}, [[#F27|F27]] and [[#F30|F30]] titled {{SpanJa|機種転換＆部隊再編}}, [[#F26|F26]] and [[#F28|F28]] titled {{SpanJa|「艦戦」隊の再編成}}
*** Equipment that is being converted should be unlocked in order to complete the quest.

== Known / Unconfirmed Quest Bugs ==
* Currently as of April 10, 2015, if you accepted quest [[Quests#C2|C2]] and [[Quests#C6|C6]] at the same time, there is a bug where your victories are counted in [[Quests#C3|C3]] even if [[Quests#C3|C3]] is not accepted (without completing [[Quests#C2|C2]]).
* [[Quests#D7|D7]] has a bug where upon unlocked, it will appear with 50% mark. However you still need to run Expedition 30 '''2''' more times to complete it.
* A bug happens when both [[Quests#Bd5|Bd5]] and [[Quests#Bd6|Bd6]] are available at the same time - even when you have only one mission active, the other one is progressing as well (e.g. getting marked as 50% or 80% complete)
** In this case progress for inactive quest stops at 80% mark, so you have to activate it in order to clear it.
** When you have both active at the same time, you need less transports kills to clear either of them.
* There have been reports of [[Quests#Bd8|Bd8]] already marked as 50/80% when unlocked.
* Bug that causes [[Quests#B12|B12]] to reappear :
** There have been reports of B12 reappearing after clearing [[Quests#Bw3|Bw3]]
** However, there have also been reports of B12 not appearing even though [[Quests#A10|A10]], its requisite, was cleared, or of B12 appearing for the first time after clearing Bw3, but before A10 had even been unlocked yet, which could point towards the possibility that Bw3 might be a requisite for B12, too.
