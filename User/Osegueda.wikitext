Iwagawa Airfield, Kagoshima Prefecture.

Well, It's been a while since I became an Admiral. Never though the day would come when I would actually have more than one ship at my command (My canoe was a ship alright!)

Far is today the time when I left Fubuki waiting for me while I went to the docks and build Isonami, Yuubari and the rest. She was rather nice to not scold me, hahaha. Those were funny days... working my ships to death, receiving them with buckets on just to send them back again to battle... Poor Yuubari, she accumulated 40 something levels in just one week... Ugh, maybe and just maybe, I worked them too hard?

Now as a new operation draws near... I can only hope I don't screw the pace for my girls.
