{{Ambox|type=construction}}This page displays existing visible equipment stat bonuses for different ships.
==Definitions==
'''AIR Radar:''' Any Radar that has an {{AA}} stat on it.<br />
'''LOS Radar:''' Any Radar with 5 or more {{LOS}} stat on it.
*Radars are able to function as both types provided they fulfill both conditions. (Example: {{EquipmentLink|Type 42 Air Radar}})

==Things to Note==
As of 30th January 2018, the following bonus stats have effect on gameplay:
*{{ASW}}: Counts toward OASW value requirements, but does not affect damage.
*{{AA}}: Does not have any effect on gameplay. AA Guns will not have increased shotdowns, Plane bonus AA will not have increased Air Power.
*{{LOS}}: {{EquipmentLink|SG Radar (Initial Model)}} Visible Fit Bonus does not work. {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft}}'s LOS Bonus has been tested to work on routing.

{{Firepower}}, {{Torpedo}}, {{Armor}} and {{Evasion}} have been confirmed to be working normally.
