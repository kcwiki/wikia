=== Summer 2015 Event ===

* Yuugumo
* Yamagumo, the ship that people sacrificed their souls to to get when she first came out
* I-19. It's been 2000 years.
Biggest mistakes: 1) Locked Kaga and Zuikaku beforehand just to test whether I can clear this particular map through the brute force way so then I was forced to use 2CVs + 2 CVLs in E-6 instead of 4 CVs. 2) Scrapped Shoukaku at the start of the event only to find out that there was an upgrade quest involving her. 3) Not levelling Maya, Abukuma, Chiyoda and Littorio the most broken CA, CL, CVL and FBB respectively. 4) Believing in Yukikaze.

Desperate times a.k.a. Innovations: 1) Engines on Taihou and Souryuu. We'll give those abyssals a taste of their own medicine. 2) 2BBVs instead of BB+BBV. Musashi really blows when it comes to resources and it turns out I can still get the same result with Hyuuga+ Italian gun and Yamashiro. In a combined fleet at least. Musashi's firepower is excessive there while Hyuuga's is 'just right' yeh.

==== About Lord Kitakami: ====
[[File:Summary of Kitakami.png|thumb|174x174px]]
And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, "Save us, Lord; we are perishing!" He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm. The men were amazed, and said, "What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?" (Matthew 8:26)

== Winter 2016 Event ==
waiit I didn't write about fall event? meh

''Shizuminasai!''

E-3 Last Dance was the most important part of this event, in fact it eclipses over every other moments I remember in this ... event. I have no creative words for this so bear with my repetition if you are ever going to read further.

This event was so important it holds a special section in my profile page. yeah.

So I started E-3 on hard mode with the following logic: My main ships are already pretty high level (80-97) and normally hard mode isn't so much harder than medium mode so going by that, it would be worth it to try hard mode for the 10 extra screws i.e. the first class medal. Oh but how horribly wrong I was. This map is just a whole new level, another extra dimension in hardness and one truly efficient large scale salt manufacturing plant. When I beat the transport gauge, I thought it would be smooth sailing afterwards. Even that part is hard, I had to switch over many different configurations, even trying Akitsumaru in desperation since my Kasumi was only level 40+ back then. But anyway yeah to the actual boss killing part.

The preboss HP knockdown was pretty simple. There were a few occasions where I got to the boss with all ships on green and I thought this would be pretty easy. But then I noticed one thing. My success rate at lowering the boss' HP significantly lowered when CV hime was present. Indeed, in my pre-last dance, I have only managed to get S rank victory once and that was when CV hime wasn't there.

For the last dance, I had well over 40 runs to kill the boss. I'm pretty sure it was over 50 runs I think. In all those runs, I had a pretty great lesson in statistics. I finally knew how hard it is to get 3 major hits to the flagship and how hard it is to get pass 3 nodes and survive with enough fighting power for the night battle. Anyhow, the key to defeating the boss is just two things

1) You can get 3 big hits on the flagship (cut ins preferred but I've seen a user here named Archer who sank the boss with non cut in torp). This requirement has a 'loose' prerequisite that

2) There are only 3 enemy ships left standing after day battle

If you don't satisfy condition 2, it would be very hard to get those 3 big hits on the flagship. I've seen my fleet hit BB/CV hime countless times when the boss only had slightly over 100 HP left. It is soul crushingly depressing but this is kancolle. I thought there would be more justice in these waters, but no they were just salty waters. Saltier than hidden power salt of pokemon hax.

As for the things that didn't work out for me, well I have to mention because it worked for others but it didn't work for me so there we go. Believe who you want to believe.

1) Don't use 2 CVLs (surface task force). Two light carriers give you an easier time with fighter power and contact by holding saiun but I am a being who is cursed by all carriers so that my carriers always have something tragic that happens to them. Using the 2CVL build I was forced to retreat a multitude of times and spend a couple of Damecons on Chiyoda.

2) Don't use FBB in support fleet. I tried using Italia, Haruna and even spending 2 blueprints to remodel my level 88 Bismarck Kai to Bismarck Drei but they were all hopeless in night battle. Their damage was awful and AP shells did not help. Their bulk were also nothing special either with the armour shredding claws/horns/glare of the BB/CV/CA hime. In place of this I used luck boosted Myoukou Kai Ni, which turned out to be in the end the best decision I made.

3) Don't use 'better' low level ships. In theory I had Yukikaze and Kirishima who should in theory be statistically superior to Shigure and Haruna but in practice they fail. Level is the most important here because of accuracy and evasion. Plus the Yukikaze in my fleet is named by myself Yukikaze the Curse God since she will always make something bad happen whenever she is in the fleet. Oh wait she did manage to bring victory to me once but that was once. once.

4) Don't equip saiun. When you use CV(B), just roll with 3 fighters 1 torpedo bomber. Put the torpedo bomber on the biggest slot and check if you can get air superiority at the boss. If not, then do something about it.

5) Don't use Maya. Not getting double attack sucks, you better use a double attacking CA. The more you weaken the side mobs, the higher chance you can get 3 or less opposing ships at the start of night battle. For the CA I used Chikuma for extra fighter power and to carry a type 32 radar for line of sight. She managed to survive most of the time too which is amazing since she is usually tragic in the past events.

6) Don't equip radars in place of AP shells. I tried to substitute my max firepower ships (Italia, Musashi)'s AP shell with radar to increase line of sight and accuracy but that will only result in taking worse damage in the 1st battle node (Double Dyson). You need the AP shells to deal significant damage so that they might sink before they do something really bad. AP shells add accuracy anyway when improved by Akashi ... maybe.

7) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE NEVER GIVE UP]. I don't know what kind of twisted reasoning you'll use but here is mine: I wanted to test the power of my fleet. I wanted to prove that my fleet can do it and beat this insanely broken boss formation. As Yugi Mutou said, "Believe in your hand! Believe in the heart of cards!!!!" Why I'm quoting him I don't know.

Yeah that is all for now. Beating the map made me feel like the yu-gi-ou (Read: King of games). With this, I'll retire from hard core kancolle and go back to an easy life. One day I'll come back. and on that day, when I am finished with THE quest chain, I'll return to marry the slayer of CA hime, Myoukou.

Now for the photos

<s>waiiiit I left my fleet formation in my other computer so I guess I'll settle with this for now:</s>
