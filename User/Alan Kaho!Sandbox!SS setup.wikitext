Before level 10, can participate in opening torpedo only when equipped with midget subs. At Level 10 and higher, will always participate in opening torpedo.

Recommended Equipment for Submarines:
* '''Torpedo type''' ({{TorpedoWeapon}}Torpedo x2)
** Only setup for submarines that allows for night cut-in.
** For maps where night battle is important or to increase preemptive torpedo damage
* '''Aerial Bombing type '''({{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane]] x2)
** SSV are capable of equipping Seaplane fighters as well as bombers.
** As your plane sizes are really small, trying to use seaplane bombers is not recommended at all.
