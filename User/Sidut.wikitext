A very nice piece of italian teitoku meat. Shame not many knows of this game here.

Kancolle is best game ever, and of course, '''KAKO''' is best <u>WAIFU</u>.

Currently at HQ 111, I ended up getting almost all the ships I long waited for. Almost 3 years into this game Only Musashi and Graf are left for me to really look for. Day by day I keep struggling with my archnemesis in this game... GETTING SCREWS.
