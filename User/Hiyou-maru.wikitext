'''Name: Charlotte'''

'''HQ Level: 105'''

'''Base: Paramushir'''

'''Date of enlistment: February 15th, 2015'''

A female admiral of unknown age. Charlotte dares not reveal all of her personal secrets (including her true name) to anyone except her closest shipgirls. All that is known about Charlotte is that she became an admiral in a time where she had been living in a neighborhood who cut down anyone who dares to strike down their ideals and had lived with an abusive family. Having seen navy enlistment as an opportunity to get away from what she called hell, she signed up immediately and took her dear sister with her when she was assigned to a base. She once feared the potential to abuse her shipgirls due to her past, but has now since gotten over that fear with the help of friends and the very first shipgirl she met, Inazuma. Calls herself the Passing Demon because of the things she's seen and how twisted her thoughts can be. 

<strike>I'll be able to help with event prep in any way, as much as possible with the information that is provided through the Kancolle twitter. Any advice I give is usually the bare mininum one needs to pass an event map unless you specify otherwise.</strike> Or I would if I didn't feel completely unsure with my analyses. -twiddles fingers-
