I'm a big fan of World war II Naval battles and warships, namely the Japanese. I search the internet on information how certain warships sunk.

I watched a documentary called "''Sinking the Tirpitz''" and because of it, I greatly admired and sort of fell in love the Tirpitz as a result. She's my currently favorite battleship, but I love the Revenge class more.

'''P.S'''

I joined Kancolle last July 17 2017.
==My Summer 2017 Event in a nutshell==
E-1: I don't like sinking loli hime and SS hime's musume, but she's creepy as hell....but cute!

E-2: Yey. I cleared it and got Hatakaze. Nice progress for this Admiral.

E-3: 2nd phase murdered me, but hey....I got Absgiri as a compensation. So all's well, ends well I suppose?
