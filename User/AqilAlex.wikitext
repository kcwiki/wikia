}}Welcome dear stranger! It would appear that you have stumbled upon my profile, for some reason.....

I'm AqilAlex, aka DoubleA by most peeps, but in Kancolle, it's Arexandaru, cuz why not :D

I'm just your average teitoku,living on nothing but packets and packets of instant noodles, learning new things along the way, don't expect anything grand from me.

Been playing this game for about 2 years now (by the time I wrote this). Dang, it's been one heck of a journey. From the little Inazuma as my starter, to all the Europeans and Americans that I'm getting. It's been one hell of a ride. But by golly, I don't intend on stopping here. Just because Phase 1 is ending, doesn't mean my career has to as well. Darn it it has just started. And for as long as these girls are around, so will I!!!! UURRAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Aaanyywayyysss, make yourself at home, or whatever they say to people looking at other people's bio....

Also Kongou best shipgirl. Though Kuma is up there in a close second place.

Complimentary Kongou desu~

|-|Story Time =

{{#tag:tabber|The Beginning of an Adventure=
--- March 2016, a cold morning, AqilAlex was busy sipping his hot coffee, when a doorbell could be heard ringing in his house.

"Huh, this early? Who could that be?" he asked, as he walked towards his front door, only to find a letter that was slipped under it.

"Hmm, what's this?" He pondered at the letter. It was blank, at least for the cover. Curious, he opened it and found an official-looking letter.

"For AqilAlex", he read out loud. "From the Kantai Collection Naval Base, Shortland Anchorage. ''Bla bla bla~~ ''You've been selected to be an admiral for a newly formed base at Shortland Anchorage. Should you accept this offer, please dial the number listed and a transport will be arranged for your arrival"

He pauses for a moment, and thinks to himself.

"Hmmmm, an admiral, you say? Interesting......... Eh, what could go wrong, huh?" 



And that's when his wild, crazy adventure begins..... ---

{{!}}-{{!}}The Final Push for the Royal Ark=

September 9th, 2017
10pm

It was the time of the Summer Event. Within the next 3 days, the operations would come to a close. After countless tries, failures, and a 2 week (ragequit) break, AqilAlex has decided to give up on E-7, and redirect his priorities to farming. In particular, Teruzuki, the sister of Akizuki that AqilAlex already had in his fleet. But even that turned out to be tedious and frustrating, as despite the dwindling resources, Teruzuki was nowhere to be found. He decided on ranting it out at the popular cafe house, "Comment". There, he found a few people willing to listen, and he vented out his frustration. But their responses weren't quite what he was expecting.

"Finish E-7, then farm Teruzuki man," said Kenji135. "Who knows, Ark might be the next Iowa and you'll miss her for years to come.

Ether Real agrees, and said, "Especially since you're just one step to clearing the event, no reason not to do it prior to farming. Heed the advice and shut down E-7."

SSTHZero gave his opinions too, saying, "Clear the event first, farm later. I always do that, and most of time I get the new ships while clearing."

After further chatting and discussions, AqilAlex called it a day and returned to his base. Along the way, he pondered over the statements made by the people he talked to, wondering if he just wasn't trying hard enough. He looked up, straight into the night sky, and just stood.

Minutes passed, then an hour, before he finally made his decision. One that changed the course of his career.







It was 9am the next day, when Ark Royal was found.....

{{!}}-{{!}}The End of Leyte, and a New Start=
''"It's not usual for me to start crying from a game. Especially a game which I'm essentially not doing much, if not anything.''

''When I first started playing this game over 2 years ago, I thought I wasn't going to play it for long. I wasn't sure what I was doing, I didn't know what everyone was saying, and I fail (and still fail today) in knowing who's who.''

''It's interesting how today, I don't see these girls as just pictures with voices. I see them as individuals, teeming with life and personality, each with a reason to be loved. It has done what no other game, book or documentary has ever done, make me cry over a freaking boat.''

''When I started this event, I was so sure I was gonna fail. After the failure of last event and hearing how difficult this one is. I knew I wasn't gonna make it. At one point I even wanted to give up, delete my account (or something like that), and leave for good. But something told me no. Something told me to keep believing. And to keep trying.''

''Now here I am. No, let me rephrase that. Now, here WE are. beating the odds and doing what I once thought was nothing but impossible. We've finally succeeded in finishing this event. I'm sorry for having given up. For wanting to quit. Please forgive me, for everything.''

''And lastly, thank you. For everything. Let us go to sleep now.''

''ありがとう"''
