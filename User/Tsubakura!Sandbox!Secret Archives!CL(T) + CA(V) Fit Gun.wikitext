'''Note: Fit gun mechanics are still being investigated to this day, hence the values are not final and may be subject to changes. Values with a question mark means that it is potentially outdated and might no longer be correct.'''
* The table shows an estimated accuracy and/or firepower fit bonus based on having '''one fit gun''' equipped.
* Bonuses from guns of different classes are simply added together.
* If more than one gun of the same class is used, multiply the modifier by the square root of number of guns (Ooyodo with two 15.5cm guns equipped for example, that's √2 x 7 = 9.89). Note that this also applies to firepower bonuses!
* The night fit bonus from the '''20.3cm''' series used to be capped at +15%. However, it is unknown whether this cap has been removed or not from the recent updates.
* There is a possibility that certain fit categories only work during the day. The possibility is plausible, but there's no concrete data proving. The alternative theory is that the night bonus from the '''20.3cm''' series overrides any other categories.
* The fit mechanics for CL(T)/CT is currently broken, preventing them from gaining any fit bonuses. This bug has not been fixed yet as of February 15th 2018.

Use [[Destroyer Ha-Class]] as basis for map [[1-1]] and [[1-2]], the stats are 16 {{Evasion}} and 1 {{Luck}}.

If you're absolutely sure that the map used in tests is [[1-1]], use [[Light Cruiser Ho-Class]] as basis instead, which has 15 {{Evasion}} and 1 {{Luck}}.
