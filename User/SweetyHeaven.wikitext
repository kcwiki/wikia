Got Yamato! Now it's time for Taihou!
[[File:Qt picnic girls.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]Currently farming 3-2A for levels and shipgirls so I can do upgrades on my DDs - done but haven't started clearing 3-2 yet, I'm farming levels on other ships. I'm also thinking about crafting some equipment as I haven't made any yet, I'm just not sure if the time has already come to try and get better weapons/aeroplanes (especially aeroplanes if I'll get to it).

Base level: 50 (as of 13-11-2015)

Base level: 55 (as of 02-01-2016)

Secretary: Yamato Kai (lvl 62) previously Kongou (lvl 64, still can't decide if I won't select her back as my secretary, she kinda won my heart).

Taken part in 2015 Fall Event: cleared E1 and E2, didn't had proper nor leveled ships to successfully attempt E3.[[File:Yamato cosplaying.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]

I think deep sea girls are cute.
