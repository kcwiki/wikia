|-|Expeditions=
=Expeditions for [[File:Greatsuccess.jpg|250px]]=
<hr/>
Expeditions can be divided up into a few categories based on their duration.  

Short: Under 1 hour.  These are good for working towards the 3 + 10 expeditions daily.  The 10 expedition daily is worth 150 {{Fuel}}, 300 {{Ammo}}, 300 {{Steel}}, 150 {{Bauxite}}, and 600 furniture coins.  These are usually not worth sparkling for but still have decent efficiency.

Medium: 1.5 - 3 hours.  These expeditions are bulkier in that you might only be able to run them a few times a night depending on how long you play.  You should sparkle for these as they tends to have the best efficiency when sparkled.

Long: 4 - 9 hours.  These are usually reserved for overnight or when you are at school/work.  Their returns/hour aren't as good as shorter expeditions, but they require less visits to 1-1 for sparkling and you aren't playing the game during this time anyways.  Always be sparkling.
	

When it comes to sparkling and expeditions, you can't just sparkle the minimum number of required ships.  To guarantee great success you will need to send a full fleet of sparkled ships.  

Feel free to mix and match expeditions based on your needs, time, and what you have available.  This is just a list of the expeditions that I regularly run.

Expeditions with good returns are marked with: {{fuel}}{{ammo}}{{steel}}{{bauxite}}[[File:Instant repair.jpg|20px]] 


=Short Expeditions=
<b>Expedition 2: 30 minutes</b>{{Ammo}}[[File:Instant repair.jpg|20px]]<br/>
Short and a great source of ammo and buckets.  If you have spare lv 1 DDs from 1-1 sparkling, you can put a SS as flag, and add in 3 DDs to run the expedition once, then scrap/modernize the DDs and rotate in fresh ones.  Not worth the trouble to sparkle for as it doesn't increase bucket chance.

<b>Expedition 6: 40 minutes</b>{{bauxite}}<br/>
Short and a great source of bauxite.  Although it is a lot of work to sparkle for this expedition, if you are really desperate for bauxite then you gotta do what you gotta do.  I run this with 6 sparkled DDs (usually Mutsuki class)
<br/><br/>
=Medium Expeditions=
<b>Expedition 5: 90 minutes</b>{{fuel}}{{ammo}}<br/>
In terms of efficiency, this is one of the best expeditions out there.  It's also short enough that you could run it a few times a night if you are on a lot.  

<b>Expedition 21: 140 minutes</b>{{fuel}}{{ammo}}<br/>
A good return on fuel and ammo, but not as efficient as expedition 5.  If you are against sparkling your ships, you can run this unsparkled with a roughly 50% chance of still getting a great success since it's a drum canister expedition.

<b>Expedition 37: 165 minutes</b>{{ammo}}{{steel}}<br/>
Ammo and steel, although there's expedition 2 for that.  Expedition 37 and 38 are used in the D9 and D11 weeklies for additional fuel, bauxite, and 1 screw.  Another drum canister expedition.

<b>Expedition 38: 175 minutes</b>{{fuel}}{{steel}}<br/>
Fuel and steel, but a whole lot of fuel.  Unfortunately expedition 37 and 38 have long durations which limits how much they can be used.  I usually run these on the weekends to get the weekly quests out of the way.  Drum canister expedition.
<br/><br/>
=Long Expeditions=
<b>Expedition 36: 9 hours</b>{{fuel}}{{steel}}{{bauxite}}<br/>
You probably don't sleep 9 hours, so run this an hour or so before you sleep.  It gives a lot of fuel, steel, and bauxite, and if you have [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft|Daihatsus]] then you can use them on the AVs as well.  One of my favorites to run overnight and during the day.

<b>Expedition 35: 7 hours</b>{{steel}}{{bauxite}}<br/>
For bauxite this can't be beat, and a good amount of steel as well.  You could use AVs for this expedition as well if you have extras or if you decide not to run expedition 36.  

<b>Expedition 11: 5 hours</b>{{bauxite}}<br/>
The second best long expedition for bauxite but with a simpler fleet setup.  

<b>Expedition 13: 4 hours</b>{{Fuel}}{{Ammo}}<br/>
Started running this during events when fuel and ammo are taking hard hits.  It's second to expedition 38 in long term ammo returns but provides the always important fuel along with buckets.  Similar to expedition 21 though you probably wouldn't run expedition 13 during playing hours.

<b>Expedition 16: 15 hours (SUPER LONG)</b>{{fuel}}{{ammo}}{{steel}}{{bauxite}}<br/>
This expedition is long enough that you will only be able to run it once a day but it returns a lot of resources of all types.  
<br/><br/><br/>
=Sparkling=
<hr/>
Unfortunately it's boring, but the great returns from a sparkled expedition cannot be denied.<br/><br/>
The table below includes the cost of one run of sparkling in 1-1 which is worth about 4 expeditions.  The right columns are the equivalent additional resource cost of sparkling said ship for one expedition.  ex. 6 sparkled DDs would cost an additional 9 fuel and 9 ammo for one expedition vs. fielding 6 non sparkled DDs.  If you were looking at efficiency, you'd then have to consider the cost of fielding 6 DD instead of maybe 4 DD when comparing sparkled vs non-sparkled expeditions, but to put it simply it's just about always better to sparkle if you have time and energy to do so.  Most of the numbers below are for unremodeled and/or efficient ships.<br/><br/>

<hr/>
[[File:071_3.png|150px|right|thumb|Are you ready? I'm a first-class lady.]]
<font size="4">Development</font>

I'm placing this first as it can't be emphasized enough: develop, develop, develop.  You can begin developing good stuff at a low HQ of 20-30.  A lot of events have Line of Sight (LoS) checks which are highly equipment based.  Your carrier's default planes are also pretty crappy and can receive a massive upgrade with developed planes.  Developing equipment will help you succeed in events and sorties so there's no reason why you shouldn't start now.  The last thing you need to happen during an event is realizing that you are short X item and are burning resources trying to develop an item that only has a 2% success chance.  Following is a list of items that you should have developed before going into an event.  You can research recipes [[Development|here.]]

|<center>2</center>
|<center>4</center>
|The [[Type 3 Shell]] or Sanshiki can be equipped on battleships or heavy cruisers to provide additional anti-air or extra damage against installation type enemies.  Although absent from recent events, the possibility of an installation type event boss always exists and it is important to be prepared.  The [[Type 91 Armor-Piercing (AP) Shell]] can now be used in place of the [[Type 3 Shell]] on battleships for attacking installations as well, so these will primarily be used on your heavy cruisers.  Installation type enemies are also immune to torpedoes (but not torpedo bombers) and are difficult to damage without one of the aforementioned pieces of equipment.

|<center>1</center>
|<center>3</center>
|The [[Saiun (Iridescent Cloud)]] is used to prevent Red-T engagements which make it harder to S rank a boss.  They also provide 9 LoS which is then doubled in LoS calculations.  Event maps are almost guaranteed to have LoS checks along the way and these will help you to meet those checks.

|The [[Reppuu (Strong Gale)]] is the best craftable +AA plane in the game and are incredibly valuable for securing air superiority.  The [[Shiden Kai 2 (Violet Lightning)|Shiden Kai 2]] is a close substitute if you aren't able to develop enough [[Reppuu (Strong Gale)]].

|<center>6</center>
|Now moving on to not required but good to have equipment, the [[46cm Triple Gun Mount]] will help get your BB up to firepower cap while also providing additional AA cover.  These have lately fallen out of popularity amongst fast BB and BBV due to overweight accuracy penalties so they are primarily used on slow BB nowadays.  
|-

|<center>0</center>
|<center>4</center>
|AP Shells are popular choices for the 4th slot on battleships nowadays.  Although it lowers the double attack chance in a 2 reds + seaplane + AP shell daytime setup, it compensates for it with daytime cut-ins which tend to one shot targets anyways (or potentially heavy damage hard targets)
|-

|<center>6</center>
|Not to be confused with the [[Type 0 Recon Seaplane]] which you have a million of, the [[Type 0 Observation Seaplane]] has better stats and is cheap to make, but is pretty rare.  The +1 additional LoS is doubled in LoS calculations.  The more LoS the better when it comes to meeting LoS requirements during events.
|-

|<center>0</center>
|<center>6</center>
|The [[Type 33 Surface RADAR]] is the highest LoS radar that can fit on a DD.  As DD cannot equip seaplanes to help with LoS checks, all they can do is equip small radars.  These fit in nicely in their third slot should you need additional LoS.
|-

|<center>0</center>
|<center>6</center>
|RADARs are popular fillers for additional accuracy, but are often replaced with AP shells on battleships.  The [[Type 32 Surface RADAR]] still offers a large amount of LoS and accuracy for those times when you need it or when you can't utilize artillery spotting.

<br/><br/><br/>
<font size="4">AA Cut-in</font>

Since you can, you might as well.  You can... can't you?

There's roughly 3 ways to set up AACI.  

1. Destroyer<br/>
One of the most convenient ways to AACI is with a DD equipped with a [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] and an air radar like the [[Type 13 AIR RADAR Kai]].  You can also equip another primary gun so that your DD will be able to double attack at night.  This setup sacrifices little if anything though it requires bringing a DD.  Should you be lacking the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], you will have to resort to using a [[Type 91 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] or [[Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] with your primary high angle guns and miss out on the radar bonus proc chance.  If you don't have one of these, I recommend you level a [[Maya]] or [[Fubuki]] to kai ni ASAP.

2. Heavy Cruiser<br/>
For an alternative to the destroyer AACI, you can set up a heavy cruiser AACI.  The downside to this is that you severely reduce the daytime attack power of the heavy cruiser, so choose carefully when you use this.  An ideal composition would be a red gun, the [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], seaplane, and air radar.  This will at least allow weak artillery spotting and double attacks at night.  Combinations can also be made with fire directors should you not have the [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]].  Recommend you visit the [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Anti-Air_Cut-In Combat Page] to review alternative setups.

3. Anything Goes<br/>
As with the Heavy Cruiser setup, other combinations will often result in reduced firepower or effectiveness in other areas.  One alternate for example is with a CLT.  You can equip a [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] or [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] with an air radar and a [[Type A Ko-hyoteki]] for a CLT with weaker day and night power, but at least you have a chance to proc an AACI!  AACI setups on carriers in PVP, auxiliary ships should they be required, etc.

<br/><br/><br/>
<font size="4">Fleet</font>

The general rule of thumb is take 2 ships of each type and level them up.  It pays to be versatile though.  Focus on getting your ships to Kai status first and modernized, then gradually work your way to Kai Ni or higher levels.  Leveling up your ships is important, but so is having the appropriate ships for branching rules which you won't know until the event has started.  Don't neglect developing your equipment!

<i>"Two ships good, four ships better!"</i>

These are a few ships which I higihly recommend leveling either for their unique abilities or for their equipment.

|[[File:Yukikaze_kai_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Yukikaze]]Yukikaze
|With a torpedo cut-in setup and her 60 luck [[Yukikaze]] can one shot most targets at the boss node during night battles (assuming it procs).
|-
|[[File:Fubuki kai2 card.png|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Fubuki]]Fubuki
|Assuming you don't already have [[Akizuki]], [[Fubuki]] kai ni comes with the [[Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] and is required to ultimately make the best destroyer gun in the game, the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]].  This does require having an [[Akashi]], but at least you can utilize the [[Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] in the meanwhile.

Other ships for your consideration:

|[[File:Maya Kai Ni Card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Maya]]Maya
|[[Maya]] kai ni with the help of [[Akashi]] can make the [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], and comes with a [[Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]].
|-
|[[File:Choukai kai2 card.png|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Choukai]]Choukai
|Although there are probably better uses for your first blueprints, [[Choukai]] kai ni comes with both the [[Type 22 Surface RADAR Kai 4]] and [[Skilled Lookouts]].  In addition, she takes the lead for most powerful heavy cruiser.
|-
|[[File:Jintsuu kai2 card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Jintsuu]]Jintsuu
|In terms of raw power, [[Jintsuu]] leads all the other light cruisers.
|-
|[[File:Yuubari_kai_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Yuubari]]Yuubari
|I hate using [[Yuubari]] since her poor armor and evasion make her a liability.  Her only advantage is her 4 slots which i can't see using for anything besides carrying utility equipment.  [[Ooyodo]] is much better overall IF you have her. 
|-
|[[File:Ayanami_kai2_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Ayanami]]Ayanami
|With the second highest firepower, decent luck, and a [[Star Shell]], [[Ayanami]] is a good DD for both day and night battle.
|-
|[[File:Shimakaze_kai_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Shimakaze]]Shimakaze
|[[Shimakaze]] has both good offense and defense, well however much defense a DD can have...
|-
|[[File:Shigure_kai2_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Shigure]]Shigure
|[[Shigure]] is my go-to ship when I want a second torpedo cut-in.  She doesn't have as much power or luck as [[Yukikaze]] but it's close.
|-
|[[File:Tone_kai2_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Tone]]Tone
[[File:Chikuma_kai2_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Chikuma]]Chikuma
|In addition to being the best CAV in the game (but requiring a blueprint), [[Tone]] and [[Chikuma]] are good enough to be fill the roles of the other elite CA should pathing allow for it.
|-
|[[File:Kaga_kai_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Kaga]]Kaga
|With her massive 46 plane slot, [[Kaga]] can command the greatest air power and is one of the best CV in the game.
|-
|[[File:Souryuu_kai2_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Souryuu]]Souryuu
[[File:Hiryuu_kai2_card.jpg|link=http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Hiryuu]]Hiryuu
|You probably won't have [[Souryuu]] and [[Hiryuu]] if you are a newer TTK, but if you do get one it would be a good idea to level them up for their unique planes.  The [[Tenzan Model 12 (Tomonaga Squadron)]] and [[Suisei (Comet) (Egusa Squadron)]] are the best blue and red bombers in the game.  It does take quite a bit of work to both find them, level them to Kai Ni, and unlock the upgraded versions of their planes.

BB? BBV? FBB? CVL? SS?  While there are some ships which are better or slightly better than others, I'll leave that up to your personal preference on which you choose to level.  Just remember that BB and BBV are slow speed, along with SOME of the CVL.  Some branching rules might require a fast fleet or a slow feet so remember to be versatile.
