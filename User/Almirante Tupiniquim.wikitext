A newbie Brazilian admiral that loves caustic soda the most.Of couse,I play Kancolle and dissolve random things in caustic soda rather to watch the World Cup.

My prefered ships are BBVs,CAVs and CAs.I started to play in November 2013,however,I usually don't have much time to play so my ship's levels are kinda low(Between 30-60).

==My favorite girls==

* Murakumo
* Michishio
* Maya
* Fusou
