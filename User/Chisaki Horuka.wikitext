'''''Hello i am Chisaki Horuka, You can call me Chi. '''''

I have been playing since the Winter 2016 Event (1 Month Old at the start of the event), Lasted until E6 in the Spring 2016 Event, Beat Summer 2016 and walked away with so many more girls that i had to buy new slots. And i am currently hq lvl 99. (will update when i can be bothered :D )

I look forward to being good friends with everyone.
