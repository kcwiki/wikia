=== '''25-02-2015''' ===
Got through E-1, E-2, E-3 (with some struggle) and E-4 all on easy and got my rewards: Katori and U-511. 
* Yet to complete 2-4 sortie.
* Found out about the Kai Ni badge so i wanted to check about a months worth of progress. Turns out i haven't done much...

=== '''11-03-2015''' ===
Finally got 10 Hishimochi from the event after wasting the little resources i had. 
* I finally collected a team of submarines and the hishimochi event helped me level them up past level 30.Doing Expedition 29 right now and soon 30 and 31 since i can use my level 68 Kongou and level 56 Akagi with 4 of my level 30 subs.I'm aiming to do quests that leads to the creation of Bismarck. 
* The event inflated my HQ level from 40 to 70!? 
* Trying to get furniture coins to get the chest set of dolls that cost 20k coins.
* Also need to find last Kongou-class battleship Kirishima for my forth fleet.

=== '''19-03-2015''' ===
KIRISHIMA GET!

Fourth fleet is now in operation and ready to do even more expedition! After a few Kongous and Hieis and a billion of Harunas, Kirishima has guided her way to me...

* A few days ago, my first Kai-Ni was Kongou, who dominated the battlefield many times has now become a problem for other fleets. She misses just as often, too.
* Up to my last Expedition 30 for the quest before Z1.
* Grinding Maya like no tomorrow and i have started to like her laid back and friendly attitude who ridicules me now and then just like my real friends. (Ha! Real friends...) Now one of my favourite ships. Also, her AA is ridiculous for a level 42. I thought she would get that in her Kai-Ni but noooo.... 88 AA and counting.
* Wedding quest chain started so I've got that to look forward to. I'd marry Kongou but not exactly my kind of girl. Bismarck here i come!

I have been searching the wiki ten times over about different things and found out that unlocking damage CGs are a thing. As i have the heart of a completionist, this was exciting and worrying.  Bad thing is i made a list on paper on all the ships i wanted to keep from the first to last and used the ships i didn't want as modernization fodder. Now that they may be gone, i have no current way of unlocking their CG unless i get them again.
* Also, German Construction has been unlocked along with my questionable female Z1 and got my hands on Z3. Z1 damage CG art is just as questionable. Z3 is fine. :)
* Method to get these CGs involved unspeakable acts towards my ships so i won't speak of it and now i have most damage CG art unlocked now! (over 3 pages of kanmusu in the red and 2 in the orange)
* Made another list, on paper, involving every ship in KanColle. Giving a tick next to the names i've gotten normal CG from and another tick for their damaged CGs. I have a long way to go...
* Special thanks to Mutsu, Fusou, Yamashiro, Tenryuu, Ashigara Takao, Atago, Tone, Chikuma, Hiyou Kai, Yuubari, Kinugasa, Makigumo, Agano, Kongou Kai Ni Katori, Yayoi, Urakaze, Z3 for the eye candy; U-511 for the most serious and awesome CG and damage CG; and Ryuujou for the cute Santa CG.
* Damage CG is for research and completionist purposes. There is no doubt about that.

A lot has happened including grinding, questing, sortieing, remodeling, modernizing, stockpiling resources and all the stuff considered as 'standard' for those preparing for the event. Collecting information and gain more experience as an admiral is a must when it comes to preparation and organisation. Damaged CG unlocking has been going smoothly and I've decided to unlock them in a more convenient way rather than doing 'that' to them... (forgive me, sweet girl-shaped weapons of mass destruction).
* German construction is being postponed until after the event where i don't think ill need to worry about resources for a while. In the upcoming event, ill need to get all the little bits and pieces of help i can get but now the massive resource depleting ritual (aka LSC) for Bismarck. I will have you in time, Biz, so wait for me.
* The new Kai Nis that appeared since last time have some of my attention including Murakumo but , the thing is, I've thrown her away a while ago. I will need to wait a while before she will come back. Choukai also got a 2nd remodel but I'm reluctant to train her somewhat but her Kai Ni is nice and more appealing. I will come to it eventually.
* Speaking of Kai Nis, I have grinding quite a lot in sorties and PVP battles which have contributed massively to my currently adored ships. I now have an extra 4 Kai Ni'd special kanmusu (in the respective order of when they were remodeled):
*# Maya
*# Chiyoda
*# Chitose
*# Haruna
Hiei is almost Kai Ni as she is level 73 while U-511 has already reached the level for her 2nd remodel. But, i want to keep her as she is for now as i adore her, her CG and tone of voice.
* Also, over the course of my grinding sessions, I've obtained more Isuzus so I'm going back to Isuzu remodeled modernization fodder and radar farming because it is so useful. 
* On the note of Isuzu leveling, if you are in the Saiki Bay Anchorage server, see me on your PVP list, level 1-11 Isuzu as flagship, flagship doesn't change for a long while, and really hate me for it then I'm sorry. I am or was Isuzu farming until I became to tired. I can't have her on other fleets since i have them constantly on expeditions. :P
* Regarding HQ level, I've reached the endpoint before certain maps become harder for me as my HQ level increases a lot. As an admiral reaching a high level, i will need to step up my game as i fear some maps will get me "(ship)REKT" (sorry, i had to). Those extra operation maps in particular including 1-5 and 2-5 are the ones i can get medals from and trade them for blueprints. Making those maps harder may become quite a pain. My LOS and ASW are fine right now but i hope that it stays that way when i reach 80 and over.

One month has passed. The event is closing up as I'm writing this. This is not exactly good or bad, however, I am content with my progress.  

Two ships decided to get a Kai Ni during the month. Hiei is now a ploughing machine for enemy ships and Yuudachi evolved during the event just to kick some ass, which she did and does now. Hibiki is my next target with less than 5k experience until she speaks more Russian than usual. 

With my speedy and forceful expedition into the event, I have completed all 6 events. My ships are not up to my standards as of yet, unfortunately, so I've had to complete the events in either easy or medium. I went ahead and completed the first two events on medium. This was because the 46cm prototype was suitable for the ships i had so far. The hard event's reward was, I don't think, unable to be equipped by the battleships i had if i wanted no penalty of accuracy. 

The second map i completed on was much easier than the first. The rewards were quite nice so i also compromised with the medium difficulty. The rest of the maps were completed on easy because i thought E-3 will screw me over and i didn't have enough ships for 3 different maps because of ship locking. I endured all the way through E-6 last week and completed the event. 

Some rewards were quite nice, including the medals, high tier gear and especially the ship reward both from completing the map and defeating the bosses. The ships who have been welcomed are: Littorio, with her big cannons and free bulges full of armour stats, and Nagato, the one whose sister likes popping up in all ways possible, including several map drops, battleship construction, LSC, and event drops... Moving on we have some likable and random destroyers suck as Sakawa, Naganami and Kiyoshimo. Uzuki has also joined in and now letting me able to complete some quests. Light cruisers Yahagi and Kinu have been added to my repertoire as well as two carriers - Shoukaku and Katsuragi; both are doing well. The seaplane tender as the E-6 reward is questionable in combat. She seems very cute and useless right now but there seems to be some kind of mechanics, in the making, to give Akitsushima some purpose.

Resources were drained quite a bit except for bauxite. Over a total of 60,000 resources were used altogether and around 150 buckets. Time is really costly if you want to be quick... But since the early completion of the event, my resources are almost back to normal.

OK... Just trying to get back into the groove...  
[[File:Mealmightyme 09 08 2015.png|thumb|270x270px|left]]
Well, it' has been a while, and as i look back to the previous post, its been 4 MONTHS since i last bothered to make an entry on my progress. I need to do this mainly for myself and see how i change myself. Anyway, a lot has happened and I've must've been been too excited to write this all down so I'll start from what happened after my previous entry, my hiatus and this event.  
[[File:Bismarck Getto 2.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Basically what happened to me on a day like any other.]]
From the last entry, at around May-June i stopped playing almost completely, playing only once in a while to get around 20k resources but my bauxite was the slowest, of course. Every now and then, at the time, i did Large Scale Construction (LSC) over and over and never got Bismarck. I also knew i had to train, at least, some ships so i trained up Kirishima (At last!), Sendai and Kitakami to their Kai Ni levels. They were pretty easy to level so it took little effort and after that, i just waited for my bauxite to pile up again for LSC so i didn't play for a long time. At one point, i actually felt like just stopping playing Kantai Collection altogether because i was so bored at the time. When i felt a small urge to get on just to check, i noticed my resources were good enough for LSC so i set up my near-full German fleet of Z1, Z3, U-511, I-8 and Verniy (Why not?). I got another 5 hour timer so i was betting Mutsu over Nagato because, in my experience, i always get her if i were to get anything. I needed more space to finish the 3 ship construction daily quest so i wasted 10 flamethrowers and BAM... No picture but... the voice suddenly saying "Guten Tag. Watashi wa Bisumaruku-" then i lost it as i saw the name as well. If anyone were to see me getting excited, it would be awkward just seeing fist pump the air a few times and swirling on my rotating chair. So yeah, Bismarck is now officially in my fleet just to wreck havoc for the enemy ships. I became more inclined to play Kancolle but some 'things' came up.   

These 'things' were personal reasons and excuses which halted my Kancolle experience almost immediately after getting Bismarck. My hiatus postponed my playing until around mid-late August, right after the start of the Summer Event. The last few weeks, i was bedridden and doing almost nothing except eating and sleeping a majority of everyday.  

Being still slightly sick and missing the first 2 weeks of the Summer event, i went to look at the event details and logged in to my account to view my fleet. I listed the amount of types of ships i had available for the event and some suggested fleets shown in Summer Event guide. As someone who levels up ships when i feel like it, naturally not '''many''' ships were high leveled. Many were close to level 10 or around 50. My few destroyers who were kai ni were joined with level 30s and 10s to complete the event. I planned which ships to use because i was going for E-1 hard, E-2 and E-3 medium, E-4 and E-5 as easy and the rest as either medium or easy. It was going smooth until E-2 since my ships were getting wrecked left, right and centre. RNG was against me in this whole event. Maybe i was too sure that i could do medium with lower leveled ships. That made me waste around 80 buckets for no reason so i was super pissed. I got Kawakaze but was it worth it? Probably. Then there was E-3... I was getting destroyed every once in a while and i chipped the boss to almost no health left. But the last dance was so annoying. When i say RNG was against me, it was until the end. I didn't have extra initial torpedo power besides Kitakami and, even though i maintained air superiority, my attacks mostly missed. Even with more accurate setup or when they're sparkled. They tear through every node besides the boss. At the last dance, my support expedition either killed a destroyer or 20 damage on one of two 300+HP aircraft carriers. Kitakami either killed that heavy cruiser, destroyer or miss. Then after remodeling Littorio to Italia for her 90mm AA gun, i was wrecking the enemy planes with Maya's anti-air cut-in (AACI), my carriers would to 20 damage on the carriers and on a rare occasion, 1 and 2 damage. By the end of the day battle, my carriers either were moderately damaged or heavily damaged before their second turn. I've tried different strategies but the results were around the same but less destroyed ships and more misses. During night battles, i was always up against the SEAPLANE TENDER boss and two BS aircraft carriers with nonsense defense. The damage i did was either disgustingly low, which ended was the boss with moderate damage at least, or ridiculously high, at around 300+ or several 100+ damages, however, not at the boss, leaving it with almost full health. The closest i got to the end was everything being destroyed on the enemy's side except for the boss at 27HP... TWENTY SEVEN OUT OF THREE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING! You can imagine the buckets i used... or maybe you can't so, basically, its the amount of buckets i had minus the amount of buckets i had. Well, that was my experience until the end of the event with E-3 left unfinished. *sigh*  

Several hours after the end of the event, i collected my thoughts and decided on what i need to do to get better for the next event. As sad as i was, for missing out on extra ships to fill my ship slots closing in to 100, i looked at the event preparation guide to get a list of ships i need to level. I claimed a bunch of stored up furniture coin boxes and bought some sommer furniture. I heard news of the free BGM from the jukebox 'Kaga Misaki' which is great for a change of pace instead of non-vocal soundtracks, as good as they were.  
[[File:List for 'progressive' repairing.jpg|thumb|161x161px|Progressive repairing in progress.]]
Right now, I've set up my 2nd, 3rd and 4th fleets to collect buckets via expedition 2,  and resources from 21 and 38 respectively. Now i just need to work on leveling my ships to kai ni, stockpile buckets and resources, and slowly repair my whole fleet storage as i didn't heal the ones that i didn't need after their use in an event map if i didn't need to. So a good 30 of my ships are half dead and in need of repair. They will get healed in due time once the ship before them gets healed.

'Tis a good day for grinding. Except the fact Kancolle is going under maintenance.   

Supposedly there is a lot of transferring of people from one server to another because of 'issues' and, also, some extra Autumn CG for Ikazuchi, maybe, and another girl. The more exciting news is Shoukaku's Kai Ni.   

I've actually heard hints and rumours about her Kai Ni and Zuikaku's, as well. So what I've done is level Shoukaku a bit from level 50 to around 67 so far. I know its not enough but it closer to an expected 80+ than 50. Before i did that, though, I took apon myself to level up some kanmusu that needed it. Tone has reached level 70 and I'm postponing using a Blueprint until i clear 2-5, etc. and level up another heavy cruiser. Fusou, Ooi, Abukuma and a variety of light carriers have passively leveled using 3-2-A grinding and my small plethora of submarines. U-511 is even levelling up even though she is pretty high in comparison to all my other ships.Ooi has managed to reach Kai Ni and has enough space for a good setup. I've found Shouhou again and, now realising she has a new portrait when Kai'd, I've leveled her up to 25 and ready to get her damaged portrait, too.  

No other event has been standing out so what I've been doing is stocking up on resources slowly. My bauxite is finally recovering because of expedition 6. I just hope the event won't start soon but, at least, it is going to be a small scaled operation. In before everyone rages at an OP boss or pre-boss node.  

One thing i can mention is that I'm trying to clear 4-4 and it is really annoying when there is a health bar for the boss and I'm sent to non-boss nodes. What I'm trying to do is getting the first four extra operations unlocked and done so i can claim at least a blueprint every month. It will be troubling but i have to compensate for remodeling my Italian ship. There are too many ships that need blueprints than i can earn right now so it's going to be gradual. There is Bismarck, Tone, Katsuragi, Abukuma, Fusou, and possibly Shoukaku so i may start with Shoukaku first. Katsuragi, Tone and may need to be much later because of some map requirements and Bismarck can be easily replace with one of the Kongou sisters for now. I will need to earn blueprit for her later. Abukuma is a high priority has she is a CL with the power of a CLT. Katsuragi will be remodeled when i have spare blueprints lying around.  

I really need to level some destroyers like Shigure, some heavy cruisers like the Myoukou sisters to replace Tone as she will be an aviation cruiser soon and get Jun'you and Ryuujou to their Kai Nis.
