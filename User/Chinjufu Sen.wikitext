Second setup: '''2CAV+1DD'''

2CAV

2DD

1CV


Route:''' BCFIKZ'''

'''Explanation''': Both setups achieve the same route to the boss. From preboss to boss requires more than 1 DD hence 2 DD is always needed. It is known to us that starting at B requries Akitsushima+2DD and 2CAV+1DD, but since 2DD is needed anyway, Akitsushima may be a more efficient setup if she is strong enough.
