Oh I forgot to tell you my name. Nice to meet you, my Full name is Ginga Amirul Muizz Purnama. Ginga Amirul or Ginga Muizz for Shorts. Or Gingatsuki for Japanese Anecdots. :D




I plays War Thunder (IGN : ginga3294), World of Warships (IGN : ginga3294), World of Tanks (IGN : ginga3294), PUBG-M (IGN : Ginga3294), Azur Lane (IGN : cmdGinga3294, Server : Sandy), and Especially Kantai Collection (IGN : Cmd_銀河3294, Server : Saiki-Wan Anchorage).

[[File:67442581_p0.png|thumb|366px|My Another Fleet.]]I also had a mind and Ideas to makes another Kantai Collection game Sequels, It called "KANTAI COLLECTION = PENTALOGY". So the History learning about World naval battles from Stone-age will prevails and Simplify. For now, I must en-riches with CGs for Promotion Purposes.
