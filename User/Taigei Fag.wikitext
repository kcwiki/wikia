Whelp. It's time I finally joined in the wiki communities.

Hi!

I'm Taigei Fag. Actually, I go by many names, but I'm usually Eroniisama or Kosaki Fag. Anyway, I have joined the community with the main reason being Kantai Collection. Why is that? I just think it would be fun to make new friends in the community. After all, we all know the wrath of RNG Goddess. Don't you just hate it when she makes fun of you?

I aspire to have a gaming console, since PC master race doesn't have everything, esepcially the Hyperdimension Neptunia games. Or to be more general, the Compile Heart games. And also, Â I want to try out the Atelier series.

My hobbies are usually reading manga, watching anime, and playing games. A typical NEET life, if I lived one like that. I'm too busy with reality, so I seldom become able to fulfill my hobbies. But hey, social life is also important.I am tolerant of any level of sexuality, so disturbingly sexualized discussions go!
