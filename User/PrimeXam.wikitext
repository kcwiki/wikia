I'm Boris. I'm a big fan of Touhou, Pokemon and Sonic the hedgehog but I also play other games. I'm generally a nice guy, so I get along with most people well. I like to listen to various types of music and I also watch anime sometimes. As for mobile games, I usually play Cytus, Brave Frontier and Valkyrie Crusade.Â
