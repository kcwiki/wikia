__NOTOC__
This is an automated bot that logs the Kancolle Wikia Chat. She was NTR'd from [[User:Gensui Hime]] by [[User:Nanamin]]. Any concerns should be posted [[Message Wall:Nanamin|here]].

* A full list of the chat logs may be found [https://mega.nz/#!qFJVCYJR!e9sGdNerCMb47Zs7eE-EEoyl7eFGIrrB6PH0hCllsr4 here]. Logs are updated every 15 minutes.
* A full list of registered values/[[wikipedia:Infobot|factoids]] may be found [[#Factoids|here]].

Bot-chan also doubles as a link storage and way to kill time when chat is dead. To get her to reply, you must start your sentence off with "botchan" or "bot-chan". For example, "Bot-chan, poi."

To combat spamming, the following countermeasures are implemented:
*Usages of bot-chan's functions are weighted differently depending on the functionality. For example, help information such as the air superiority values is available at all times. Pointless responses such as the random responses or fun set responses carry a weighting of 3, which is the maximum. A user builds up weights from each their usage of bot-chan and cannot use her anymore when they go over the limit. If a user has 2 weights and attempts to use a functionality with a weighting of 2, they will be denied as 2 + 2 > 3. Similarly, a user with 3 weights can still use help functions because 3 + 0 is not greater than 3.
*Games have individual timers:
**Russian roulette is restricted to occurring once every 15 minutes.
**Reverse roulette is restricted to occurring once every 15 minutes for the person who triggered it and the loser.
