Event body completed on Hard.<br>
Event finished on Easy with about an hour and thirty minutes to go in the event, partly due to real-life and partly because I didn't know about the e-peen medal.<br><br>
First real event (commissioned during Fall 2014 event), so no documentation of resources used exists.

I was hoping to farm E-5 for Isokaze but since I cleared the map someone has been sent to red before the boss at least half of the time I sortie (up to and including Nagato) and the times I make it to the boss I can't get an 'S'. I'm kinda thinking I don't really care anymore. I'd be better off fishing for Yuus and Maruyus in E-6... <br>(EDIT: Or not.)

1-shots. 1-shots everywhere. I guess we'll just finish E-7 with Isokaze fishing at E-5.

Resources include a few hundred runs of E-3 [[U-511|Yuu]] farming pre-clear.<br>
Resources do not include a few hundred runs of E-3 [[U-511|Yuu]] farming post-clear.<br><br>
Honestly, I probably had the time and resources to do E-7 Hard, but the e-peen medal wasn't worth the SAN to me. Post-clear farming for [[U-511|Yuus]] took precedence. Began event with three [[WG42_(Wurfgerät_42)|Wurfs]] and one [[U-511|Yuu]], ended with five [[WG42_(Wurfgerät_42)|Wurfs]] and enough [[Prototype_FaT_Type_95_Oxygen_Torpedo_Kai|FaT]] torpedoes to equip my original [[U-511|Yuu]]. One more vote for never remodeling her. Five more [[Prototype_Seiran|Shiois]] (for a total of seven) is okay too, I guess, but I really would have liked six [[WG42_(Wurfgerät_42)|Wurfs]].<br><br>
Post-clear farming resulted in three [[Prototype_Seiran|Shiois]], [[Arashi]], and a dupe [[New_Model_High_Temperature_High_Pressure_Boiler|Amatsukaze]]. And [[Umikaze]] I guess, but whatever.
