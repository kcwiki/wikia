''  ''''' Greetings, fellow Admirals. My name is Hattington, or Hatt for short. I am a full-fledged KanColle fan who claims Kongou as his one and only shipfu. I look forward to meeting you all and contributing to this Wikia in a positive manner.'''


==My Naval Base==
''[[File:2018-06-27.png|thumb|left|400px]]''​​​​​












It's nothing fancy, but this is my naval base, located in Palau Anchorage (with Kongou at my side UwU). I am newer to the KanColle game than I am the community, so my fleet is not very progressed. 
==Contacts==
I am way more active on Instagram and Discord than I am the Wikia, so if you must reach me, it is best to do so using them.

==Good Things to Know about Me==
- I love all things Bongou

- I spam :UzukiLUL: and :Jervaited: in discord too much

- I can be sarcastic and cynical at times

- I love Halo just as much as I love KanColle but for different reasons
==Misc.==

I am just as involved with the Halo community as I am with the KanColle community, averaging a 6.0 kda and playing Halo almost daily. If there are any Admirals out there who also play Halo, then props to you. I will provide the link to my Twitch account for those who are interested.
