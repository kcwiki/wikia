Hello there! I started playing KanColle on 06/06/2016.
My first event was Summer2016 (I cleared it on easy). First A-class medal (and full hard clear) obtained in Fall2017 event : >

Nagato is the best boat. Fight her. (My Nagato is lvl160 and her ID is 58 ☀*°▽°* . Also I keep 12 because I can, but 11 of them are lvl1)

THEY GAVE HER KAI2 I LOVE THEM

Also I'm a hobbyist artist and draw cute things in my free time (I am a lot more into Fire Emblem with my art lately, but i still draw Kancolle girls sometimes).

Go see it here: '''[http://sunnyvaiprion.tumblr.com/ Tumblr]'''

Unique ship count: '''219/219''''

''I FINALLY HAVE ALL SHIPS, LIKE THE COOL KIDS!''

''Only 2 library entries I dont currently have filled and dont see myself doing any time soon are Suzukuma CVL forms. Save for their needless conversion remodels, I finally found enough BPs for every girl I have and have some spares in case of new K2s! Phew!  ''

May the RNG be on your side today!
