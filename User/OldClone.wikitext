Hello fellow admirals!

I'm a fairly new player; I started sometime in the beginning of March 2015. I'm somewhat proud of the fact that I was able to clear the Spring 2015 Event (albeit almost all on easy) with my under-leveled ships and rookie knowledge of gameplay mechanics. With the help of fellow players and this wonderful website, I was able to challenge the current event and clear it within a satisfactory time.

Summer 2015 Event Map Clears:

E1 - Hard

E2 - Hard

E3 - Hard

E4 - Medium

E5- Easy

E6 - Medium

E7 - Easy

Currently I am farming E5 in search of the mythical "Roma", who has eluded me for 10 days straight and counting.
