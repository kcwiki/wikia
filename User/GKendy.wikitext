Yo! 3 events veteran TTK here. Joined the game in last days of spring's event, 2015. Thanks to this wiki's help, guides below and lot of effort, I was able to achieve most of my goals on the first event I could prepare myself, Summer 2015. I'm a TTK who prioritizes collecting kanmusu over hard medals. Maybe when I finish farming all girls I'll try harder, and possibly join the frontlines too.

Summer 2015 - I've enjoyed clearing that event a lot, very challenging. Kudos for the devs! But that's because I didn't have to do E7 on hard. As my first event, I didn't feel my fleet and RSCs were ready for that level of hardness, and I really needed Teruzuki.

Fall 2015 - THE farming event. I'm glad the devs think about the new players and gives them the opportunity  to get Prinz/Akizuki again. But they aren't fools too, most players had to suffer to get them. I was no exception. Nonetheless, was very satisfied with the event. I've re-learned too that the best weapon against RNG, persistence, pays off. Wasn't a hard event to clear, so got my first hard medal even spending most of RSCs on farming.

Winter 2016 - This event I faced a major defeat, because I didn't get my second first class medal despite having a fleet good enough for it. Swallowed pride to secure Zara on medium, after reaching 4 digit RSCs on E3 hard last dance. Had bad luck with the last boss, so many times got close to finishing. But this result I brought on myself when I prioritized farming cute girls over clearing, and spent around half of total RSCs before trying to finish last boss. Can't complete every objective all the time. Not sad though, the new addictions to my fleet are worth more than the medal to me. "OMG, Kumarinko!! ... Suzuya, Kumano, please bring Mogamin here now!"  ☀http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm23195516  =`)

A bit about myself. I'm a gamer from Brazil, live in Curitiba. I have interests like history, military, other cultures, music and anime. I first came in contact with Kancolle when watching the anime. However, it took some time to start playing the game, mainly because I thought only residents in Japan could. I have half japanese ancestry and am still learning the basics of their language. So, hard kanjis for my level of nihongo scared me away too. But I realized later we can find all we need to play on the wiki. I'm very grateful to the people who made the tutorials and translate new information for the community. Also, after seeing the anime, browsing some Tenryuu-chan cool images on Pixiv and listening to some フフ怖Rock, I decided to know better the game. I can say it was the massive and fantastic fan-submitted content that really brought me to this wiki, and then, start playing. Each day, more awesome new videos/pics are released on the web. I love it! Waiting anxiously for the anime's season 2 and movie.

My most favorite characters are Tenryuu, Shigure, Yuudachi, Kiyoshimo, Akebono, RJ, Kawakaze, Yamashiro, Ikazuchi, Asashimo. Tried to pick only 5, but was too hard. The kanmusu are made to be loved. I swear I'm not a Lolicon, with all those DDs as most favorites. Chose Nachi to be the only one that I will raise to 155. "More than 1 waifu will ruin your laifu!". So that's why I put a nice image of her here. Her fierceness in battle and modesty caught my attention since the first days of playing. And I think she is misunderstood by some, who say she is "manly". Her in-game CG and speech could be considered not so feminine, but like some japanese said, it depends on the context. Although my first impression of her was while watching the anime.

Aside from quests B41 (no air support, BBs everywhere, have to defeat strong compass-chan AND S-rank boss with possible sub = much SALT) and B44 (thank RNG-sama for allowing me to complete this one), I'm not one TTK who likes to bad mouth the devs or Tanaka. Even those quests are entirelly optional and acceptable, a few very hard quests don't hurt. I'm enjoying this game a lot, and appreciate their good work. A game where they think about both veterans and new players, release new content often and don't try to steal your money with that, deserves our loyalty.[[File:52960554 p3.jpg|thumb|327x327px]]
