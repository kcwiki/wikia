I've become a Teitoku for a year now. I started playing around May 18 and I became addicted to Kancolle ever since.

I'm a huge anime and videogame fan. I'm not a complete expert in World War II, but I have knowledge about the history of several warships, namely the Japanese and the Germans.

My endgame dream is for Tirpitz to be implemented and get her. Until that happens....I must never give up.

'''HQ level:''' 101

'''WANTED:''' '''Akizuki.....probably on the next event.'''

'''LSC: Saratoga.....'''

'''[[File:Yamato_01.png|thumb|left|400px|My first LSC ship. My first love. I still love this big girl.]]'''

'''[[File:Almost_out_of_LSC.png|thumb|left|400px|Bismarck and Taihou came. I never felt this happy in my entire life.]]'''
