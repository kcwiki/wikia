Describing myself as a non-hardcore player, my headquarter LV is currently 106 despite the fact that I am an old admiral from Maizuru Chinjufu (''舞鶴鎮守府'').

Starter kanmusu is '''Fubuki'''. And still not yet remodeled.

As what you can tell from my username, '''Yahagi''' is my favorite Kanmusu.

First class medal obtained.
