Please be advised as of today January 11th, I have resigned as a KanColle Wikia contributor and from its staff.

It has been a wonderful time there since 2016 of when I joined, but due to its recent operation since 2018 of other staff members dropping out, it has become harder to operate the website while Personal Life and Work are prioritized. 

I have considered resigning for awhile since last year, and due to some life and work issues as of late, it has become harder for me to become as active as I was in the past (You can tell by the late and slow Youtube video uploads, where in the past I used to upload them much faster). 

There is also the fact the Wikia is majorly understaffed as of late (as mentioned above, a lot of staff members have resigned throughout 2018), with every staff member having their own life priorities, quick updates doesn't seem exactly possible anymore with there being no back-up staff members either, with the fact everyone lives in a different Timezone. 

I will still be updating my Facebook Page and be uploading Youtube Videos. However I will no longer be writing articles/guides on KanColle Wikia anymore. 

Thank you for following me and hope for your understanding of my decision.--->
