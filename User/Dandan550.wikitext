===Introduction===
Hello, I will be one those editors whom dedicated on that "historical" note. It will not be much, but I will try to make it as clear as possible for new/veteran admirals to understand more about the Kanmusu.


==Operations==
===2013 Operations===
Was a fresh recruit in the Admiralty. Although just a month before the Fall Event, however I learn quickly as much as possible despite the limitations the KC wiki has to offer at that time... In that moment, it's all trial and error. Blood, Tears and Sweat.
<tabber>Fall =
{{Progress|0}}
[[Fall 2013 Event|Ironbottom Sound]] Operations was the first and consider the most brutal of all operations I've face, what's more this is my first... Heckle it is like a fresh recruit being thrown into the hellfire itself

Sad to say, the experience was so bad that I barely remember this save for the few records I had somewhere.

3/5 Maps completed. 4th Task was fully postponed after the HP boss regen return back to full...

Ah, the [[Christmas 2013 Event|Blue Steel]] Operation. I'm more prepared in this event now thanks to the painful lessons from the previous event which I learn stuff that is important... Stocking as much as resources and repair buckets for the big operation.

Iona is MVP in this operation :)

===2014 Operations===
<tabber>Spring =
{{Progress|80}}

No or limited logs about the [[Spring 2014 Event|Deep South Operation]]. But I do know that I participate this operation anyway...

Around this time, the deployment of seaplanes become important somehow. Tone whom one of my old members that time get her Kai Ni.


3/5 Maps completed. ExOps were a new addition and I'm still unprepared for this map... Sakawa-chan can wait.

The [[Summer 2014 Event]] aka Battle of Midway or AL + MI Operation is the first large operations I taken to the task, as well as the introduction of the shiplocking which kinda an underestimation until the ExOps.

I was slightly cocky at this time that become my fatal flaw itself...

5/6 Maps complete. Attempted to clear the 6th one, but was proven not worth it due to low resources...

[[Fall 2014 Event|Operation Kon]] is I think one of my easiest operations I done. Perhaps I was more prepared than usual and perhaps the sightings of a German Heavy Cruiser gave me a strong motivation as well.

More new mechanics were added (difficulty modes), another German arrived (cute loli in fact) and a girl that look similar to my dreams. To be such I was return from a 1-2 week break just when this operation and seeing that girl somehow...

This is the first and perhaps only operation where I went all Hard and might not happened in the future. Perhaps because I was very prepared or perhaps I was lucky.

[[Spring 2015 Event|The trip to Suez Canal]] also known as Operation 11. Italians had joined the cause, a new Carrier and some sort of Seaplane Tender that is either cute or just cute (or plain useless but cute). I was slightly underprepared and unable to hitch a hard in the last map... Perhaps 2 large operations in a row was a bit of a understatement.

The [[Summer 2015 Event|Operation FS]] had allow me to revisit the SLOT for another time, although this time more prepared than ever, or was suppose to be.

At first I had to hire [[Kikuzuki]] in the 1st 2 maps which was progressively easy, then by the 3rd map things going
a seesaw due to RNG manipulating the board. The final map however was pure cancer itself, the [[Air Defense Princess]] is basically shredding aircraft like she was some Cold War-era Destroyer... However once Intel on how to weaken her revealed, I decided to do so before beating her nonsensically. Which after several attempts the vengeance from the failure from the 2013 Fall operation.

I do consider that I start favoring torpedo cut-ins as part of doctrine.

Another operation in the SLOT.  Despite it is called ''"Transport Operation"'', the operation is very restrictive on what ships to deploy and I had no other option but to wait.

On the other hand, another Indian Sea Theater operation as well. Seems the Western Abyssal Forces are unwilling to give up their control in that region.

The [[Spring 2016 Event|Pearl Harbor]] ''reenact'' operation introduces the Land Base Air Support (finally) that allowed us to have bombers from airfields to deliver hell to concentrate Abyssal ships formations. Nevertheless the idea was basically a new thing and of course there were bugs and HQ can't provide much a concrete information.

Also this is the introduction of the USN (Allies) to join the Combine Fleet forces in an unending war against the alien foe. (Also includes bombing Pearl Harbor)

It is almost a year since the Operation Rei-Go, as at last the greatest naval battle in the Pacific had finally come. But that doesn't mean I were prepared for it, nah it kinda becomes a natural thing that I forgot something to do... *gets yank by Michishio* (although she gets to join in later)

The Nishimura was the highlight of importance of this operation, but of course there are other ships that participate in this very large battle that for a good reason a majority are in my fleet. Nevertheless one at least 2 girls are unprepared or shall I say, preparing for the final map.

However I realize that this operation is another fated task, as that someone began to discover the wreckage of the ill-fated fleet. Perhaps it is time to regain their lost honor, which I did.

But this is just the beginning...

===2018 Operations===
I'm at the zenith or perhaps close to retiring this game. But still that doesn't mean I won't accept further challenges the HQ offer. Still problems continue to pour down...

My current health is deteriorating and I wonder if I will survive long enough.
<tabber>Winter =
{{Progress|0}}

[[File:Grand_Battle_Fleet.jpg|680px]]

Part Two of the biggest battle. However I'm too unprepared due to Real Life shenanigans that delay me in focusing in resource hoarding... The lack of shipspace finally reach me in tilting point. 

Although I had some of the important ships needed in this operation, I'm slightly worried that I might get jinx as my recent days are. But I'm confident of my girls, they're too eager and wanted to win.

Once again, Nishimura Fleet is called forth to help their comrades as Musashi and Zuikaku take the helm in the fight against the overwhelming foe...

Dance with the angels.


'''End Operation Results''': It seems you'll need a lot of luck in the last battle... It doesn't matter what difficulty it was, it was hellfire. I barely went over as a day and a half attempts to breakout in the last kill ended in nothing. Still you'll need miracles...

I decided to go another event despite the ill preperations,(then again I had like 900+ buckets and 200k to begin so nah). Of course despite it is a "small-scale" event, I know that the devs are put stuff to make it long.

Another is I started late, but that was enough after getting plenty of rest and vital info from other TTKs. However I'm not in a good shape to take the event seriously...
