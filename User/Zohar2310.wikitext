Hello, I'm Zohar and this is my wall.Â 

I'm now living in Hanoi, Vietnam and I started playing kancolle since July 3rd, 2015.

My goal is to get a first class medal in the near future.

Event achievement:

Summer 2015: E1 normal, E2 easy, E3 normal, E4 and E5 easy, E6 normal and E7 easy.

Fall 2015: E1 and E2 hard, E3 and E4 and E5 normal.

Still not strong enough to get a first class medal.

Waifu List:
# Haruna.
# Jun'you.
