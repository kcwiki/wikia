<strike>That one guy who will never be Marshal Admiral because he's never commited enough.  </strike>GOT IT!

<strike>Also has the most horrible luck ever in ship construction, ESPECIALLY CVs.  I pray for my sanity when Large ships hit.</strike>

I'm Lycanous

Tawi Tawi is my home.

Currently a Level 98 Marshal Admiral (\o/ finally) , finishing up my collection as well (lacking a Hiryuu still... and some other uncraftables)

Feel free to ask me questions and I'll try to answer to the best of my ability.
