==Base structure details==

The social and communal parts of the base are divided into four sections, in the form of three circles which are centred around the admin HQ and centre of operations.[[File:Map2.png|thumb|map (new version, WIP)]]

All kanmusu have access to the circles further out than the one they are a member of.
All kanmusu can access the admin HQ ONLY with the express permission of either the TTK or whoever is on duty at the time if the TTK is not present. Kanmusu who are not a part of any circle may only access the admin HQ when expressly ordered by the TTK to attend.

Kanmusu who are in the Inner Circle ONLY can invite kanmusu from the middle circle to enter the inner one for up to 12 hours at a time, or invite kanmusu from the outer circle to enter the middle one for up to 3 hours at a time. The admin HQ has to be notified upon their arrival and departure and this can only be done at most once per Inner Circle kanmusu per week.

The amount of say over the decisions of the fleet that a kanmusu has is also determined by their circle access. Inner Circle kanmusu are allowed to participate in discussion and debate about certain operational or structural decisions. All Kanmusu who are a part of a circle are allowed to vote on the proposals decided, with vote share distributed as follows:
*TTK - 35%
*Inner Circle - 35% distributed evenly among members*
*Middle Circle - 20% distributed evenly among members*
*Outer Circle - 10% distributed evenly among members*
*Those with no circle access do not get a vote
Note: If between 50 and 100% of any group participates, the share is fully distributed among those kanmusu who do vote. If less than 50% participate then the amount of vote for each kanmusu is (vote share for that circle)*2/(number of kanmusu in the circle). So if there are 14 members of the inner circle and 10 vote, then they each have 3.5% of the vote. If 5 vote, however, they each have 5%, bringing the total for the circle to just 20%. If "yes" has a higher % figure than "no" then the motion is considered passed.

The access rank of each kanmusu is determined at irregular intervals of at least one week. No kanmusu can go up or down more than one rank every two times the ranks are changed. All new kanmusu are not in a circle, but joining the fleet does not count as going up in rank.

Latest rank change date: 10th September 2018:
* New Kanmusu (No Circle) - [[Hiburi]], [[Daitou]], [[Gambier Bay]], [[Intrepid]], [[Uranami]], [[Samuel B. Roberts]], [[Fukae]]
* Moving up to Inner Circle - [[I-168]], [[Oyashio]]
* Moving down from Inner Circle - [[Maya]]
* Moving up to Middle Circle - [[Minazuki]], [[Yamakaze]], [[Saratoga]], [[Tokitsukaze]], [[Asagumo]], [[Kasumi]]
* Moving down from Middle Circle - [[Asashimo]], [[Okinami]], [[Pola]]
* Moving up to Outer Circle - [[I-19]], [[Iowa]], [[Nenohi]], [[Commandant Teste]], [[Akitsu Maru]], [[Kamoi]]
* Moving down from Outer Circle - none
