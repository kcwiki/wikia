if you want to survive you better get your wallet running💳💳💳
playing all day and trying things to have fun😂🔫
but buckets all gone i might as well quit👌👌👌
so much to do, so much obscure mechanics to see, trying my whole life not to get salty🍟🍟🍟
you'll never clear if your support don't show🚷🚷🚷
you'll never pass if your entire fleet don't glow🌟🌟🌟

hey now, youre not fossil, not priviledge, git REKT💣💥

10 years since tanaka turned kancolle into a salt infested game .i walk through the empty streets trying to think of something else but my path always leads to kantai selection.i stare at the screen for hours and try to summon maruyus in LSC . i have tried all the recipe. but it is no good. i flame tanaka everywhere on kcwiki discord facebook and try to resist him but it is all meaningless. the end is near.i then usually browse some old kc3 data and cry myself to sleep.

Seriously, TANAKA. I blame you for the state of this sub. You are more concerned with making SALT yourself than stopping this bullshit from hitting the event page. You spend all your energy on being first to post collaboration tweet, making game hints so bad that comtiq magazine is forced to spill all the information from the game and making reviews all for your self-image and kancolle go BAD. I blame the TANAKA for the decline of this community.
