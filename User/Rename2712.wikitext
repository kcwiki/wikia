<p>I decided to write about my first account, as a way to let me remember its final moment on Summer 2016.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>My account was created either around Spring or Summer 2015.
<li>My server was Hashirajima Hakuchi.
<li>Only managed to participate Winter 2016 and Summer 2016 events. I missed Spring 2016 due to college.
</ul>

<h3>What happened on Summer 2016</h3>
<p>Starting mid 1st week of Summer 2016 event, I had a problem where I would randomly get Error 201 upon changing screen. If I'm not wrong, this also occurred on my Winter 2016 event, but just not as severe as this. This happened countless of times when I was doing E-2H, and it wasn't a pleasant experience since most of my attempt on clearing it ended up getting an abrupt Error 201.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I have an internet connection that gets randomly disconnected (sudden limited access). Whenever this occurs, I had to restart the router, as well as the game. This was something unavoidable unless I change my router (maybe). The rate of this happening was at minimum 2-3 times daily.</p>

<p>In any case, after few days failing my last dance E-2H (due to Error 201 random occurrence), I started looking for solutions and found one (on reddit) from an admiral who had a similar problem. He mentioned that he'd stayed away from playing for 48 hours and his problem was solved. I followed his advice, so I took my rest starting from 12th until the 14th day of the event. After 48 hours, I resumed playing and the problem really did get solved. With that, I was finally able to clear my E-2H.</p>

<p>Before doing E-3, I power-leveled my Fubuki, Kumano, Mogami and Suzuya. The powerlevel was for a duration of 2 days, and my KC3Kai's record shows that I had sortied around 340 times (17 pages). My expeditions were pretty much going all day long too since I checked them throughout the day and do a longer expeditions before I went to sleep, and the next day back doing expeditions that have high hourly rates. On my free time, I did Orel Cruising, but not that much. Not sure if worth noting, but I'd done around 120 expeditions for a duration of 3 days (14th to 16th event day).</p>

<p>On the 16th day, I finished my E-4N in less than 20 sorties (checked through KC3Kai's record). After clearing the event, I went to farm other ships I haven't obtained. After some time, the last Error 201 occurred, and the next refresh told me that my account had been suspended. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it's the end of the line for that account. As for my final attempt, I asked the support what I did wrong and whether it was possible to get my account back. The reply that I received mentioned that I broke some rule (Article 6 thingy). Knowing that my account could no longer be saved, I decided to deactivate my old DMM account and created a new one.</p>

<p>Not sure the exact cause of my ban, but I can only think of 2 possible causes (take it as a mere grain of salt):
#I played too much that I've been considered as a bot. Following the 48-hour rest, I played as if tomorrow never comes (Only had 5 days left to clear Summer 2016, after all).
#*340 sorties in 2 days. (Powerleveling mentioned ships)
#*Consistent expedition deployment with 2 fleets. (Combined fleet was required)
#Countless unavoidable refresh due to lost internet connection. This is unavoidable for me unless I change my router to a new model (unsure if that'll solve the problem).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">''Fresh start in second account.''</p>

<p>The following day my account got suspended, I created my second account.
Gonna work hard to surpass my previous account's achievement.</p>
