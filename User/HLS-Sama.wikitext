Hello there. Normally I go by with the name HLS, which is my in game name as well but that name was already used on this wiki. My start as an admiral was right in the middle of Fall 2016 Event, where my favorite ship Saratoga was released. It is a pity I dont have her yet. As for the rest, I just recently cleared my first event: Fall 2017 and Suzutsuki is the prove of it. I've been through a lot of things, my early days I didnt care much about the ships, so yes, I am kuso, or I want to say, I was kuso. However every day in this game made me realize, it is not about clearing maps and stuff, it is about collection your fleet.

So once again Murakumo, sorry for sinking you 1 year ago. Still didnt have the balls to face you just again. What makes me more sad is that she was my starter ship.........

Now, that is said. Overal I have decent knowledge about this game, but I am not that person that goes all-hard on in the events. But I am a person who enters an event on the first day, so you can say I am a frontliner, but a frontline for Ez-Medium Modo.

More about myself, I do like anime a lot. Also I can handle cringy things very well. I don't mind 18+ content as well, if you are even thinking about sending it to me.

Before I started KanColle, I played Touhou alot, but Touhou community was dying so I searched for something else. KanColle was one of the choices I had between 2 others that I dont remember well anymore. Ofcourse I haven't forgotten Touhou and everything I have done in it so yeah.....

Something I really like about Kancolle is the numerous unique personalities the kanmasu have. Another thing is the bgm which I like. It is also an requirement for me to play a game.

Now I guess I post here something about my progression:

I have a YT Channel as well named HLS:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsjLLw1DST-5XmP73sL8hLA?view_as=subscriber (I dont have enough subscribes for a special link). Now there is only Bullet Hell content on it, but soon there will be Kancolle content on it as well.

I don't have anything to say for now, but if you have any questions, ask me and I will probably answer unless it is to personal.

Still I am new to this whole wikia thing, so correct me if I am doing something wrong.
