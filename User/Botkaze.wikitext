* [[:Category:Generated modules]].

The idea is to have a (generated) covering table here (possibly implementing [[Kancolle Wiki:Sitemap]]). E.g., all pages can be [[wikipedia:Partition of a set|partitioned]] by namespaces, pages in a namespace can be partitioned by categories, [[wikipedia:Divide and conquer algorithm|etc]]. K out of N pages in a part can be controlled (that is, generated, can have categories for fully generated pages, semi-generated pages, etc.), giving 100 * K / N % covering for that part.
