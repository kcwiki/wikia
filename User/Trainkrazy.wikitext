'''Bio:'''

What can I say?  I'm a university student who really enjoys anime/manga and especially Kancolle!  I'm a new admiral who finally decided to join the game after seeing so much amazing fanart!

I enjoy playing World of Warships, Kancolle (Obviously), Nier Automata, and Overwatch along with many others.  As far as my favorite girls go in Kancolle I'd have to pick Yamato, Nagato, Iowa, and Jintsuu, they are the best!

Joined this wiki to try and participate in the community, although I don't know very much I assist in what way I can!  Sally forth, fellow admirals!

I apologize if anyone is curious about who made the pictures, I couldn't really find the original artists!  Their works go to them of course, I wish I was as talented as these people!
