Hia there! Dizzy here! I've been playing KanColle in my spare time for a number of months (more like well over a year or two now lol) now and just enjoying myself and slowly learning things as I go. I rarely ask questions unless it's something I can't dig around on the wiki or google for an hour to find.

I don't usually rant much either, but I may do stuff here when I feel the need to haha!
