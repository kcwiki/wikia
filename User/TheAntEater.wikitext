Hello! I am TheAntEater, a fellow admiral in Kantai Collection. I started playing Kancolle since Spring 2015 and i find this game very interesting and time consuming :D. My colleague here originally owned the KC account until he gave me this game to me (He's retired now). Feel free to ask me about what's in my account. RNG may be with you ^-^.
