=='''Ships'''==


===Admiral's right hand===
[[File:Shiranui_Kai_Ni_Card.png|thumb|left|200px|Shiranui kai ni]]'''(Lv. 98)''' The most respected and feared ship, even by the abyssal, due to her cold personality and gruesome performence in battle, and also the fastes leveling ship, '''Shiranui'''.. But since she loves to fight, bloodthirsty (how many would describe her) doesn't mean evil or ruthless at all. Shiranui is the one who is always ready to take a shoot for her teammates and will crush everyone who wants to hurt them although it's human or not.
(She is also often seen together with Murakumo and Nagato, when she's not together with the admiral, just talking or sometimes drinking even though she usally avoids contact with others.)
*'''Strength:''' 
*'''Weekness:''' 
*'''Likes: '''Wearing glasses
*'''Hates: '''
*'''Friends: '''Murakumo, Nagato, Hayasui


''"Someone I can always rely on, inside and outside battle, so I want her to be able to rely on me too. She may avoid most contact with others, acting cold and seems to be annoyed of everyone, but I know what behind those iron curtain is...because she told me." -'''Admiral'''''


''"Seriously, I don't know what the admiral likes about her. She is strong no doub but she seems like to be someone who wouldn't care about other especially not for an idiot like the admiral. But she does. I can see it even if she is trying to hide it." '''-Murakumo'''''


''"...Shiranui trägt manchmal eine Brille auf Bildern, deswegen is sie da...Ja das is ne meme Brille. Aber eher sowas bei Shiranui...Sieht doch niedlich aus. Shiranui mit Kimono." '''-another admiral''' as she showed the admiral some pictures of Shiranui.''

===The Inner Circle===
The "Inner Circle" is a special group of five ships who are one of the first under the admirals service. Not even Shiranui is a part of it They share together with the admiral the secret of the sixth one and often take care of the smaller ships:
(They do have special permissions. At  emergencie cases they were allowed to build temporary fleets and sortie on thier own.)

[[File:Murakumo_Kai_Ni_Banner.png|thumb|left|Murakumo kai ni]]'''(Lv. 99) Murakumo '''was the very first ship under the admirals command and is also the one who bring law into this base and forces the lazy admiral to do his work properly and sometimes beat him up when he has done something stupid again. When she isn't running after the admiral, she is trains with other destroyers or is studying to become better than Shiranui.

(She is good friends with with Shiranui but between them is a war. Before Shiranui, she was the right hand and looks like she wants that position back.)
*'''Strength: '''

*'''Likes: '''Being treated like a princess
*'''Hates: '''Dirt
*'''Friends: '''All of the Inner Circle, Nagato, Shiranui (rival), Hiryuu, I-8, Shigure
[[File:Haruna_Kai_Ni_Banner.png|thumb|left|Haruna kai ni]]'''(Lv. 96) Haruna '''likes everyone and everyone likes her. As the strongest and first Kongou-class in this base she has to take the role of the big sister sometimes, when Kongou tries to kill the admiral again with the deadliest hug of the world but also from the deadliest food of the world...*ahem*...Hiei...*ahem*..., but she also plays a sister role together with her sister for all the others in the base.

(When a real battle begins she turns into a protectiv killer mashine, but that just happens in a real battle not in training or so.)
*'''Strength: '''Being a perfect wife
*'''Weekness: '''Can't say "no"
*'''Likes: '''
*'''Hates: '''
*'''Friends: '''Everyone
[[File:Yuubari_Kai_Banner.png|thumb|left|Yuubari kai]]'''(Lv. 81) Yuubari''' is the brain of the Inner Circle. Her rich knowlege about tactics and weapons makes her a respected leader even when she is not the flagship, what is often the case, but if follow her orders you can't do something wrong. Everyone in the base know that. 

(In her free time, she often works together with Akashi on experimental weapons, what is one of the causes for random explosions, or she is at the admirals place and they play video games together.)
*'''Strength: '''Always find a way to solve a problem
*'''Weekness: '''Wierd hobbies
*'''Likes: '''Gaming, experimental weapons
*'''Hates: '''Cleaning up (causes problems with Murakumo)

[[File:Mutsu_Kai_Banner.png|thumb|left|Mutsu kai]]'''(Lv. 60) Mutsu''' is the mother of the Inner Circle. If you want to hurt someone you have to get through her first. She want and will protect everyone even with weapons if she has to, and if her guns didn't hit you her fist will hit for sure. Mostly fighting in the fronline she attract the enemie's attention and tears whole abyssal apart if they get to close.

[[File:Akagi_Kai_Banner.png|thumb|left|Akagi kai]]'''(Lv. 51)''' Last but not least, '''Akagi'''. Together with Shoukaku, they are by far the best archers in the base. A deadly combiantion of perfect aiming and patience, she never misses her target. When she takes aim, one breath late her taget ignites into a gigantic fireball or rains like falling stars from the sky. She is a perfect example not just for other carriers but all the other ships. Her low level is the result of an sad story togeher with Kitakami.

(Often seen with the admiral eating, since both of them likes food so much.)
*'''Strength: '''
*'''Weekness: '''
*'''Likes: '''Eating
*'''Hates: '''
*'''Friends:''' All of the Inner Circle, Kaga, Souryuu, Hiryuu, Shoukaku, Zuikaku, I-8, Kitakami
There used to be two more ships. Hiryuu and I-8. But that would mean that they have to share the sixth place so they were taken out. Both of them aren't that long in the fleet too, because of an insident that happened.

===Keepers===
These ship are holding the base alive and rarely get into actual battles

.
[[File:Tatsuta_Kai_Ni_Banner.png|thumb|left|Tatsuta kai ni]]'''(Lv. 95) Tatsuta''''s actions are sometimes wierd and confusing. Talking with a calm voice and havine a constant smile on her lips could be a nice sight. But compare to with what she says and her behavior on the battlefield let you think only one thing: "she is a scary angle".

(At nighttime she sometimes vanish from the base. No one know where she went.)

'''[[File:Kinu_Kai_Banner.png|thumb|left|Kinu kai]](Lv. 54)''' Very popular by the destroyers, '''Kinu''' keeps thier moral high and train and plays with them most of the time, and she also likes to prank others, so she sometimes do stupid things she later regret.

[[File:Yayoi_Kai_Banner.png|thumb|left|Yayoi kai]]

'''(Lv. 53) Yayoi''' may be the ship with best eyesight and mostly avoids battle. That makes her the best ship for expeditions and escord missions, where she always is the flagship. Even though she avoids battle, when she is really angry she wouldn't hesitate to use voilence in a disturbing way.

(A day before she came into the admiral's base, she was witness of one of his other secret sides. Since then she carrys this secret with and swear to never tell it someone. But this terrible secret doens't hurt thier bound together, is strengthen it more than that.)

[[File:Верный_Banner.png|thumb|left|Verniy]]'''(Lv. 99) Verniy, '''or still called '''Hibiki,''' is, together with Murakumo, the highest leveled ship. But she is the one who get damaged the most and sometimes disappoints her admiral, but he can't be angry at her for long. Another admiral said is because she doesn't have acces to vodka.

But she is an example good though, that a bart like her can make it pretty far in this base, so she is an importent symbol of "hope" and "never surrender" for all the others.

A powerful destroyer with two personalities. The first cute, lovely Yuudachi who loves to cuddle and the second similar to Shiranui, bloodthirsty monster on the battlefield. These two personalities makes you love and fear the word "Poi" either is a sign of someone wanted to be cuddled or it's the last thing you hear.

She mostly avoids battle that makes her the best ship in the base for escord missions, what she does the most. She used to sortie together with her sister Yuudachi but can't keep up with her stength and the will to fight. But still, if she has to, she would."

But unlike Akatsuki she performs orders as fast and as good as she can and she also wants to become stronger, maybe even stronger than Shiranui and Murakumo. In combination with her personalities, never disobeying and knowledge she would make a good flag ship, but she also has a long way to pass.

She is able to hit moving targets with torpedoes in a distance where it's almost impossible to do so, and that even with one eye behind an eyepatch, and when the target comes to close she slice it into two with one swing with her sword like she is doing it with flying shells.
