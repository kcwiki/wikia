}}Hi,

Just a Commander from Australia that joined the game on my 21st birthday, 15th of March, 2014.

I joined because when the game originally launched April 2013, I saw'' [[Kaga]]''. At first I just liked the stoic look, not knowing her name. Over the next year I learned she was the personification of an aircraft carrier, and learned her name soon after.  

Within my first 3 weeks of starting, I had ''[[Kaga]]'', along with ''[[Akagi]] ''and'' [[Soryuu]]''. I married ''[[Kaga]] ''on the 2nd of May, 2015. She's now a strong Lv. 140 and growing, loaded with the [[Reppuu Model 11]] I got from the [[Spring 2014 Event]], and has rarely left ''Kaga'''s deck since.

As of 09 Janurary 2020, ''[[Perth]]'' took over from ''Kaga'' as secretary of my fleet.

Here is a list of my favourite ships:

Sold to Australia, she was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy June 1939.
Perth saw action in the Mediterranean at [[wikipedia:Battle of Cape Matapan | Cape Matapan]] and evacuation of [[wikipedia:Battle of Crete | Crete]]. Returning home in 1941, she was assigned to the [[wikipedia:American-British-Dutch-Australian Command | ABDA]] Fleet and left Sydney in Feburary 1942.

| [http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-stuart-i HMAS ''Stuart'' (I)] (D 00, later I 00) was one of 9'' ''[[wikipedia:Admiralty type flotilla leader|''Scott'' Class Destroyer Flotilla Leaders]] built between 1917 and 1921. Named for the [[wikipedia:House of Stuart| Scottish House of Stuart]]. ''Stuart'' served her Royal Navy career almost exclusively in the Mediterranean Station until 1933, when she was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy along with 4 V&W Class destroyers of similar age. This group of 5 would later be known as the '[[wikipedia:Scrap Iron Flotilla|Scrap Iron Flotilla]]', ''Stuart'' herself being 'The Leader of Crocs'. In the very early stages of World War Two, ''Stuart ''patrolled the Indian Ocean before proceeding to the Mediterranean in late 1939. She served in the Mediterranean theatre with distinction, to the point [[wikipedia:Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Cunningham]] said to ''Stuart'''s crew in Alexandria, "You'd think this was ''Stuart's'' war!", after her actions during the Battle of Calabria, where she was ordered to screen a carrier, and instead was observed by Cunningham leading the vanguard of destroyers into battle. Also fought with ''[[Warspite]]'' and ''[[Jervis]]'' at Cape Matapan. Later served in the Pacific as a convoy escort and troop transport, her age preventing her from being of any further use as a combat ship. Decommissioned 27 April 1946, after 29 years of service in the RN and RAN.
