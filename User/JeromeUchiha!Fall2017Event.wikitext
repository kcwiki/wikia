|''"When two cruisers, three destroyers and Akitsumaru are only allowed, they are sure struggling in terms of air power. The survival of the battle is heavily depended on Maya as she shoot enemy planes as many as she can. But this fleet are packed with heavy firepower enough to sink mediocre abyssals with one shelling only. With help of LBAS, they manage to cripple some Nu-class and Ru-class abyssals, which the fleet will take care of the rest. Admiral out."''
