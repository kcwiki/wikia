I've been an Admiral for three years now (and still counting).

'''About me:''' I like videogames, watching anime, writing Fanfictions, and headpats. But more importantly, I like trolling my buddy who goes into Abyssal mode whenever I do something stupid (but worth it).

I'm also an Event frontliner who charges into the event on Day 1 since my ship girls are maxed levelled (some of them I married), I max upgrade my equipment, and I would always hard cap my resources in preparation.

HQ Level: 120
