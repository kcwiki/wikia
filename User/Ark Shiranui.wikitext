{{Template|title1 = Naval district Admiral|image1 = MUTCHUKI.jpg|admiral_name = Weiss|server = ??? Naval district|starter = Fubuki|hq_level = 120}}I'm an aspiring writer who loves to write Fanfictions and playing Kancolle....and AL. I love both games.

For the past four years I played Kancolle, my desire to add Enterprise to my fleet. To me she's my waifu.

I'm a big fan and an enthusiast of German and Japanese warships.
