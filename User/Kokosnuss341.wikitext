Hello and welcome to my profile.

You might womder why I even started playing this game. Well I was in a skype call and a lot of others always talked about some weird "Kantai collection event". I knew about the game before, yet I never had a reason to start it. But since they all seemed to be angry at something and I really wanted to know, I tried starting the game too. Yet the servers where all full. 

But then on the 5th of March 2016, at 1 am I started playing this game, with the help of a friend. I chose Samidare as my starter ship. She somehow looked good to me. At first there was this crafting... I got a ship called Naka. But then when I went on the next sortie another shipgirl dropped. ever since that she always had a place in my team.

She always did a good job. And on the 12 of december 2017 I gave her what I promised her.

Yet I know I am not the best admiral. I was inactive for a long time due to me not having internet most of the time. And thus the events were all done on easy, if even. 

== Events ==
* Spring 2016 Event
** I barely knew anything about LoS, Combined fleet and everything. E-2 and the boss there was the person that literally gave me the rest. I barely had any ships in kai, none in kai ni and yet... with one lucky shot from Furutaka, I managed to cler E-2. Massively underleveled I went on to E-3. 5 runs later I got what I wanted and gave up the event. What did I want? U-511.
* Summer 2016 Event
** I went in there, full of motivation, yet... there was a drop on E-2 that I really wanted and since I always play on easy... Well that doomed me to stay there, like 300 runs were used and when my ressources were completely dying out, I got Prinz Eugen, but there was no way to get Aquila or Warspite. It was 2 days until the event ended so I decided to give up once again.

* Fall 2016 Event
** I got to the E-4 boss phase and had a long struggeling until Tenryuu had enough and blew the boss up. 
** I went to E-5 like 3 times before realizing that I can't even make this. I don't have enough Reppu to get a perfect Landbase defence and an S rank on that node was impossible for me.
** There was a drop on E-1 that I wanted. Everybody wondered what the hell I even wanted there. I got nearly all rare drops and felt really trolled, I only want Hiryuu for that damn quest. And I got her finally. I was finally able to start doing my quests again.
* Winter 2017 event
** My plan was clearing this event all medium, to show that I can finally do something.
** E-2 boss came along. There was no way I could win this on normal.
** Normal clear failed, some shipgirls got saved. I-13 and I-14 were mine in the end.
