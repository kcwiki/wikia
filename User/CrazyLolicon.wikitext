Finally created an account after being "A wikia contributor" for 2 weeks.

Only have been playing for a month. Fleet levels are way too low for the event. I've been lucky I was able to get to E-4.

'''HQ level: 56'''
'''Highest Kanmusu Level: 70'''

Note: Buckets are low thanks to Junyou's drunk ass using CL demon's torpedoes as... toys. Taiha'ed for days before Kongou decided to start hitting criticals.
