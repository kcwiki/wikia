Very lazy living being, sometimes playing while sometimes not.　気だるい....

Favorite ship ? Ikazuchi, please spoil me baby. Tone is 2nd.

My highest level ship is Taihou, just 92...I thought i spam her a lot during events lol.

Akizuki, Hatsushimo, Maya, Haguro, Ooyodo, Souryuu (2nd one), Akitsushima, Katsuragi, Uzuki, Hatushimo, Yayoi, Kinugasa, Nagatuki, Prinz Eugen.... duh. Probably Fubuki, Littorio, Akitsumaru (2nd), and Harusame too...
