Well after the struggle that was E-6 Easy (I dunno why i got a lot of LD tries) i can say that I've got to E-7,which is well i m doing it on casual.In spite of the fact that well intrepid got a potato face i m gonna get her nevertheless,and mostly because of Rsc problems and i would like to farm for Iowa and Saratoga.
