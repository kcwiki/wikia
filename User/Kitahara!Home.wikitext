'''Latest Thoughts'''

Wow, what a facelift Kako got with her Kai Ni! Sadly I don't need any more CAs, else she would've had a permanent spot for sure.

But more importantly, no shitty quest WOOO fdsfdsgdsg. Patience is already being tested with [[Quests#B45|Quest B45]], having been sent north in all 32 sorties so far, so not having the pile of bullshit-tier quests increase is always nice. I really hope that releasing quests with awful branching rules doesn't become a trend. Getting destroyed in battle is one thing, but not even getting a chance to have the battle in the first place is infinitely more frustrating, and definitely not my definition of fun.

Last but not least, the arrival of 4-5 is a pleasant one. Assuming its less trouble than 5-5 (which is not a hard achievement), I'll ditch doing the former for 4-5 to get my monthly blueprint instead. Already got surplus blueprints, so that one extra medal isn't worth the trouble imo.
