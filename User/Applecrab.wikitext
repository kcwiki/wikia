== Etue dayo~ ==

=== Bio ===
Etue was born from a realm of dreams thrown into a world Etue doesn't understand. Through the passing of time Etue has learned that there is no such thing as equal morality and that the possessiveness of man is spawning things of great concern yet Etue is not to judge such things because Etue is simply Etue and not a judge of mankind. Still Etue shall strike with cruel justice whenever Etue can to spite those barely looking and those looking away if within the law of the lands. 

=== TTK ===
Etue is a terrible TTK who has sunk Nya and Jintsuu once. Repending forever for this great sin Etue vouched to never play in such a sleepy state again. Only Naka and Murakuma know of this vouch which is from the days of HQ LV 20. Once Tama-nya was Etue's third highest ship together with Jintsuu in 2nd place, now only Naka remains among the top 5 while Tama and Jintsuu's reborn forms never reached such heights again. 

=== Desire ===
Etue is going to make a double DD destroyer fleet.
