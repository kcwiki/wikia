The '''Maintenance script''' account is used by [[Help:Community Team|Wikia Staff]] or [[Help:SpamTaskForce|VSTF]] to make automated deletions across multiple pages or multiple wikis.

If you feel the script deleted a page it should not have deleted, any [[Special:ListAdmins|admin]] on this wiki can undelete that page. Please inform the [[Wikia:Community Team|Community Team]] about any problems with this script.
