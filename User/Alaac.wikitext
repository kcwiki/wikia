Winter/Spring 2015: Slowly discovers Kancolle on tumblr

Early April 2015: Watched the Kancolle anime. Impossible to not laugh at the opening.
22nd April 2015: Did my first kancolle fanart.

15th May 2015: Got through the lottery.

22nd May 2015: [http://alaac.tumblr.com/post/119398614721/this-is-the-closest-i-can-get-from-mutsu#notes Found Mutsu on my way home]

17th June 2015: Not paying attention and almost kuso Dechi and got kicked by [[User:Dechidechi|DechiDechi]] 3 times from the chat for that.

6th July 2015: Event announced to be Carrier based. Tries to craft CV since I only have 2 CV.

7th July 2015: In attempt to craft CV, got 3 times Souryuu which is already in the base. To balance that, crafted then Shokaku and a Reppuu.

8th July 2015: Dechi kuso this time. Wadunduh being an intestinal reject took my attention as I was being banned for calling a player "Son of a drunk hamster", I didn't noticed dechi got REKT at the very first node on World 2-2, which I was cycling since the morning without any significant damage, chaining perfect S most of the time. As result of this lost, Shoukaku got her moral boosted. It's a sign.

Summer Event 2015: The pain is real. I managed to make it through E1 medium but the rest will be on Easy. E5 was RNG hell for me, which marked the end of the event. See you another time, Teruzuki...

Fall Event 2015: And I thought summer was a nightmare? Bitch please. Try to get the germans when your time to play is from saturday midday to sunday 16h with a 10h sleep break in the middle because you're at the army and tired as hell in the week-end which is the only time you have a computer to play. Fuck that shit, no Graf, no Prinz, no Yuu. I all failed. Even Kashima cannot domine my disapointment/rage.

October 26, 2015 to August 6, 2016.

Army kicks in. Fall event, as previously mentionned, is much fail. Winter event is another story, since nothing really interested me. Spring is another sadness comming, since Iowa and Pola got away. Still got Kamikaze. But most important, Yuu, Amatsukaze, Hatsuzuki and Zuikaku In the meantime, I still got to complète my fleet and train my ships for summer event. Also the good news went to me AFTER spring event that I was in the beta of Android version, meaning I could have played while on the field and thus getting Iowa. My frustration was just bigger.

Summer Event 2016: Holy fuck hell what a drop bath! Nimu, Okinami, Kazagumo, Akizuki, Unryuu, Aquila, Kiyoshimo and Warspite. Still farming for Taigei too, I've been looking for her since a long ago
