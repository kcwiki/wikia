Introduction:

Good day fellow admirals. I'm Toxictangent, recently assigned to Hashirajima Anchorage in September of 2015. Though I am still inexperienced, I'll contribute as much as I can to event pages and other things like that. May the blessings of the RNG gods smile upon your naval base, and I wish you all the best in your sorties.
