Started working in Saiki Bay Anchorage on 24/1/2015 1930 JST. Been playing in a Casual-Hardcore style ever since.
Atago was the one who got me into the game.

Married Atago on 20/8/2018.
Married Amatsukaze on 14/2/2020. Married Saratoga on 14/2/2021. 

I-26 arrived on 10/9/2018, along with the arrival of Nelson on 23/9/2018, my Kandex is finally complete for the first time.

Failed to get Hayanami on Winter 2019 but got her again in Spring 2019. Kandex completed once more.

Failed to get Grecale on Summer 2019 but has First Class Medal since 24/9/2019.

Got Grecale on Fall 2020 and now have full Kandex again.
