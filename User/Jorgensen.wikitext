'''Hello,'''

I´m a german TTK who was interested in Kantai Collection since December 2014 (I wanted to know more about the game, my Japanese Teacher was playing) and played it for the first time in June 2015 (I couldn´t participate in the lottery very often and if I participated I wasn´t succesful ^^). But as for now I´m a really happy TTK with lot´s of Kanmusus.
