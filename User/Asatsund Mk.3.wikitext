always go easy at event except if there's a good reward at higher difficult

too lazy to resocolle thats why my rsc never go up to 6 digits

my buckets and devmats never go up to 4 digits

stuck at 5-3

my greatest enemy is {{CatBomb}} , compass, and RNG.

never for once i got first class {{Medal}}
 who cares about pride, this is kantai korekushon not kantai puraido

but damn that ranking reward is good too...

sometimes forget about the pvp system
