=== Aircraft Carrier (CV(B)) and Light Aircraft Carrier (CVL) ===
Because the way of how carriers works, there simply is no static setups available for them as each map demands a different setup depending on the situation. However, we will provide guidelines here on how you want to equip your planes on your carriers, so you can maximize your efficiency as much as possible.


'''Note:'''
* Aircraft are capable of [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranking up]], making them much more efficient in their role.
* Carriers are capable of launching an opening airstike when equipped with bombers.
* {{RedPlane}}Dive Bomber and {{BluePlane}}Torpedo Bomber can participate in shelling phase
* Carriers can '''NOT''' attack if they are not equipped with any bombers.
** Carriers can '''NOT''' attack either if all the bombers are shot down during the opening phase.
* Carriers cannot shell during day when they are medium damaged (<span style="color:orange;">'''中破'''</span>).
** Exceptions are armored carriers like {{ShipLink|Taihou}}, {{ShipLink|Shoukaku Kai Ni A}} and {{ShipLink|Zuikaku Kai Ni A}}, they only stop shelling when they are heavily damaged (<span style="color:red;">'''大破'''</span>).
* Carriers cannot participate in night battle.
** Exception is {{ShipLink|Graf Zeppelin}} and the base form of {{ShipLink|Saratoga}}, but since their planes are not capable of attacking during night, their uses during night battle becomes very limited.
* Do not use bombers in a PvP match, because the bauxite loss can be terrifying depending on your opponent setup.
* Take caution when you are facing enemies with high {{AA}} stats like the {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|text=Tsu-class}}.
* Establishing Air Superiority is your priority, Aerial bombing is just a bonus.
* Your opening airstrike damage is affected by the plane slots and whether you use a {{RedPlane}} or a {{BluePlane}}.
* Shelling damage is unrelated to plane count, as long as there is at least one plane.
** Default range is Short for most of the carriers, but it may be increased by equipping {{YellowGun}} Secondary gun with range Medium or {{AviationPersonnel}}[[Skilled Carrier-based_Aircraft_Maintenance_Personnel|SCAMP]] with range Long
* Light Aircraft Carrier can attack submarines
** Can equip {{SubPlane}}[[Type 3 Spotter/Liaison (ASW)]] and/or {{Autogyro}}[[Ka-type Observation Autogyro]] in addition for higher anti-submarine stat {{ASW}}
*** Keep in mind that {{SubPlane}} and {{Autogyro}} alone cannot allow you to attack submarines, you are still required to have at least a {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}} equipped.


====Guidelines====
Best practices when setting up your equipment where carriers are involved. Keep in mind that you can always freely switch slots around on the same ship, by holding your mouse for a few seconds and dragging it.
* Always try to prioritize getting at least AS and preferably AS+ with {{GreenPlane}}Fighters. Do not overshoot your fighter power target, fighter power itself only helps you achieve a specific air control, but does not do anything else extra. Do not make the mistake in believing that having more fighter power equals to more opponent planes being shot down.
* When equipping {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, prioritize equipping them on the '''smallest''' slots. Do not worry about the low plane slots, because fighters only suffer from proportional shot downs.
* After that, use either {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}}Bombers to fill in the rest of the slot. Always attempt to use bombers on the '''biggest''' slots or the first slot if possible.
** When trying to conserve bauxite, avoid using big slots and prioritize using plane slot numbers that are closer to 17. This is to minimize proportional shot downs. Do not attempt this though, if the map does not allow you to conserve bauxite.
* Now that your slots are loaded out, it is time to decide whether you want to use a {{YellowPlane}}Recon or not. Recons have a higher chance of initiating Contact, which increases the airstrike damage.
** {{EquipmentLink|Saiun}}, if you also want to prevent <span style="color:red">Red-T</span> during battles.
** Anything else, if you're not interested in preventing <span style="color:red">Red-T</span>, like {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft|text=Type 2 Recon}}, {{EquipmentLink|Prototype Keiun (Carrier-based Reconnaissance Model)|text=Keiun}}
* If you are using a CVL in an submarine infested map like [[1-5]] for example, you can choose to replace the bombers with {{SubPlane}} and {{Autogyro}}.

'''Example 1:'''
Note: Assume that all the planes are [[File:Aircraft Proficiency Gold Chevron.png]].<br />
Map [[2-5]] requires 35/69 to reach {{Tooltip|AS/AS+|Air Superiority/Air Supremacy}} respectively, if you use the south route. With 3 CVL, you can easily reach AS+ with the following setup:

'''Example 2:'''
Note: Assume that all the planes are [[File:Aircraft Proficiency Gold Chevron.png]].<br />
Map [[4-5]] requires 207/414 to reach {{Tooltip|AS/AS+|Air Superiority/Air Supremacy}} respectively, while you're using a 2CV(B) setup. Since the boss is an [[installation]] and getting AS+ with only 2 carrier is unrealistic, we use {{RedPlane}}Bombers as well as try to aim for AS instead. As you're simply lacking slots on carriers while the engagement modifier is not a threat, a {{YellowPlane}}[[Saiun]] was not necessary.

Map [[5-5]] requires 207/414 to reach {{Tooltip|AS/AS+|Air Superiority/Air Supremacy}} respectively and assume you have 2 CV(B) and 1 CVL available. A {{YellowPlane}}[[Saiun]] is out of the question as Red-T is very advantageous to you, simply because of how dangerous the enemy {{ShipLink|Battleship Re-Class|text=Re-class}} is. To make the most out of it, you can also opt to use one of your CVL as a fighter mule and achieve AS+.

====Fighters====
*{{GreenPlane}}[[List of Fighters by stats|Fighters]]
* Primarily used to increase your fighter power for establishing [[Aerial Combat|air superiority]].
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives more flat fighter power bonuses.
* Keep in mind, if your opponent has no {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, your own {{GreenPlane}}Fighters become useless as well.
* Having more fighter power than required will not do anything beneficial, avoid doing that to maximize the efficiency of your slots as much as possible.
*{{GreenPlane}}Fighters only participate in the first phase of [[Aerial Combat]]. This means that {{GreenPlane}}Fighters only lose planes proportional to the slot size and are immune to {{AA}} fire.
** This makes it very beneficial to equip fighters to very small slot sizes, because that will effectively prevent you from losing any planes provided you can consistently achieve air superiority or higher.
** Another reason why equipping {{GreenPlane}}Fighters in smaller slots works, is because the majority of your fighter power comes from [[Aircraft Proficiency]].


====Torpedo Bomber====
*{{BluePlane}}[[List of Torpedo Bombers by stats|Torpedo Bomber]]
* The primary bomber which you will always be using, except for a few exceptions.
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased critical hit rate and an increased critical damage up to 10%, while also providing minor boost to fighter power.
** {{BluePlane}}Bombers on first slots of a carrier receives double bonus and can reach up to 20% increased critical damage damage.
* Has a 0.8x or 1.5x multiplier during pre-emptive attacks.
* Bombers on bigger slots do more damage during the opening airstrike.
* Weaker in shelling compared to {{RedPlane}}Bomber, but irrelevant as you use stronger planes.
* Unlike {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, bombers participate in the first and second phase of the [[Aerial Combat]]. This mean that bombers are prone to being shot down by enemy {{AA}} fire. It is thus not recommended to equip bombers on very small slots if you know your enemy {{AA}} is going to be high.
* Performs weaker in [[Support Expedition]]s.
* {{BluePlane}}Bombers '''CAN''' attack [[installation]]s.
* Has a chance to trigger contact, unlike {{RedPlane}}Bomber.


====Dive Bomber====
*{{RedPlane}}[[List of Dive Bombers by stats|Dive Bomber]]
* The secondary bomber which you will be using, in scenarios where using a {{BluePlane}}Bomber is disadvantageous.
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased critical hit rate and an increased critical damage up to 10%, while also providing minor boost to fighter power.
** {{RedPlane}}Bombers on first slots of a carrier receives double bonus and can reach up to 20% increased critical damage.
* Has a static 1x multiplier during pre-emptive attacks.
* Bombers on bigger slots do more damage during the opening airstrike.
* Stronger in shelling compared to {{BluePlane}}Bomber, but irrelevant as stronger planes are obtained.
* Unlike {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, bombers participate in the first and second phase of the [[Aerial Combat]]. This mean that bombers are prone to being shot down by enemy {{AA}} fire. It is thus not recommended to equip bombers on very small slots if you know your enemy {{AA}} is going to be high.
* Prevents carriers from attacking [[installation]]s during the shelling phase if the carrier has at least 1 {{RedPlane}}Bomber equipped.
** This can be advantageous, because carriers lack the necessary anti-installation equipment to be able to efficiently deal with them. Instead, they can help assist in clearing out the other surface enemies.
* The primary bomber you will be using for [[Support Expedition]].
* Cannot trigger contact.



====Fighter Bomber====
*{{BluePlane}} or {{RedPlane}}Bombers with fighter properties.
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased critical hit rate and an increased critical damage up to 10%, while also providing minor boost to fighter power.
** {{RedPlane}} and {{BluePlane}}Fighter Bombers on first slots of a carrier receives double bonus and can reach up to 20% increased critical damage.
* Known fighter bombers are:
**{{RedPlane}}[[Type 0 Fighter Model 62 (Fighter-bomber)|M62 Fighter Bomber]]
**{{RedPlane}}[[Zero Fighter Model 62 (Fighter-bomber / Iwai Squadron)|M62 Fighter Bomber(Iwai Squadron)]]
**{{BluePlane}}[[Re.2001 G Kai]].
* Functions exactly like a bomber, while providing a reasonable amount of AA power.
** Because they function exactly like a bomber, they too are susceptible to enemy {{AA}} fire. It is thus not recommended to equip bombers on very small slots if you know your enemy {{AA}} is going to be high.
* While they have an unique mechanic, their stats are worse than the {{GreenPlane}}Fighters and genuine {{RedPlane}} and {{BluePlane}}Bombers.
* Unless you have no choice and you have to use those fighter bombers just to barely increase your fighter power above the AS/AS+ range, you generally should attempt to switch your carrier slots around to maximize your fighter power.


====Recon Aircraft====
*{{YellowPlane}}[[Saiun]]; {{YellowPlane}}[[Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft|Type 2 Recon]]; {{YellowPlane}}[[Prototype Keiun (Carrier-based Reconnaissance Model)|Keiun]]
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Contact contact] chance.
* Does not participate in [[Aerial Combat]] phases and thus, cannot be shot down.
*{{YellowPlane}}[[Saiun]] is primarily used to prevent [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Engagement_Form_Modifier Red-T] while also giving you a decent modifier for [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Contact contact].
**Note that preventing Red-T is not always advantageous or necessary. As Red-T also affects your enemy, it is sometimes even better to get Red-T.
*{{YellowPlane}}[[Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft|Type 2 Recon]] or the {{YellowPlane}}[[Prototype Keiun (Carrier-based Reconnaissance Model)|Keiun]] is used to increase your contact rate and damage modifier in scenarios where you don't want to prevent [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Engagement_Form_Modifier Red-T].
* The use of a {{YellowPlane}}Recon should only be considered when you can efficiently achieve air superiority while also maintaining a lot of bombers to attack your enemy with it or if the {{LOS}} stats provided is necessary for the branching rules.


====Jet Aircraft====
* [[File:Jet-powered Fighter-Bomber Icon 1.png]]{{EquipmentLink|Jet Keiun Kai}}; [[File:Jet-powered Fighter-Bomber Icon 2.png]]{{EquipmentLink|Kikka Kai}}
* Can only be equipped by {{ShipLink|Shoukaku/Kai Ni A}} and {{ShipLink|Zuikaku/Kai Ni A}}.
* As of now, only Jet Fighter-Bomber variants exists. The [[Aircraft Proficiency]] ranks functions the same as their regular counterpart.
* Surviving planes uses {{Steel}} to resupply, while Jets that are shot down are replenished with {{Bauxite}} as normal.
* Jets are unique in the way that they have their own "[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Jet_Assault Jet Assault]" phase in which they can preemptively launch an attack on the enemy before the 1st phase happens. After the Jet Assault phase ends, they participate along with the regular aircraft in the 1st and 2nd phase.
* Jet Fighter-Bombers are susceptible to {{AA}} fire during the "Jet Assault" and the "2nd Phase". This means that they suffer twice the shot downs from the enemy and in theory, they can be attacked twice by [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Anti-Air_Cut-In AACI]. They are however, more resistant to the proportional shot downs in the 1st phase of [[Aerial Combat]].
* Since they suffer twice the shot down rate from enemy {{AA}} fire, you are recommended to use them in bigger slots if you want them to be useful. You are not recommended to use Jets if the map features several high {{AA}} enemies like {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|text=enemy tsu classes}} or {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp|text=Artillery Imps}}.


====Anti-Submarine Aircraft====
* Primarily {{SubPlane}}[[Type 3 Spotter/Liaison (ASW)]] and {{Autogyro}}[[Ka Type Observation Autogyro|Autogyro]].
* Used in conjunction with a {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}} to increase your {{ASW}}.
* Keep in mind that {{SubPlane}} and {{Autogyro}} alone cannot allow you to attack submarines, you are still required to have at least a {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}} equipped.

*Vì CV(L\B) chỉ dùng để mang máy bay nên rất cần chú ý vị trí , thứ tự lắp
*Ưu tiên lắp đủ (không cần lắp thừa) {{GreenPlane}} để hạm đội bạn có thể đạt AS
*Lắp combo {{GreenPlane}} , {{RedPlane}} , {{BluePlane}} để tối ưu hóa sát thương
*Ưu tiên lắp {{RedPlane}} , {{BluePlane}} vào slot nhiều máy bay nhất , sau đó mới đến {{GreenPlane}}
*'''CVL có thể và sẽ ưu tiên tấn công SS''', nếu không có mục đích chống ngầm thì mang CV
* CV(L\B) không có cách lắp theo khuôn mẫu chính xác (do mỗi CV có slot may bay khác nhau) nhưng cơ bản thì như dưới đây
* <span style="color:Blue;">Đánh đêm</span>: CV(L\B) chỉ tham gia đánh đêm khi có {{SCAMP}}[[Nhân viên hàng không đêm]]([[Nhân viên hàng không đêm + nhân viên sàn đáp|+ Nhân viên sàn đáp]]) và [[File:Carrier-based_Night_Battle_Fighter_Aircraft_Icon.png]][[TBM-3D]].
