'''RicoTrooper''' (IGN: RicoSailor) started playing Kantai Collection on May 2015. He was persuaded by a certain friend of his to play the game and helped him get into the game. One month passed, he reached HQ Level 40+.

He uses the Error Girl as his profile picture to prove that the [[:File:NPC FinalBoss.png|Tutorial Fairy]] (the ones in orange/yellow hair; as seen in Tutorial) is different from the commonly known Error Musume searched around Google, which is mostly seen in [[:File:Error .png|Cat Bombs/Cat Errors]].

I'm also fond of making memes. Better check out [http://imgur.com/a/dsHBV KanColle Memes] album right here.
