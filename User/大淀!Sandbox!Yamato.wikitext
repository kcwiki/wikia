==Character==
[[File:Anime yamato.png|thumb|250px]]

=== Appearance ===
* '''[[Glossary#List of Vessels by Artist|Artist]]''': Shizuma Yoshinori ([http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=141206 しずまよしのり])

=== Personality ===
* '''[[Glossary#List of Vessels by Japanese Voice Actresses|Seiyuu]]''': [http://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu Taketatsu Ayana] (竹達彩奈)

==Trivia==
*2013 August event special map E-4 completion reward.
*Requires 2.5 times more fuel compared to [[:Category:Nagato Class|Nagato class]] battleships.
*Was cynically referred as "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_Hotel Yamato Hotel]", a hotel located in Dalian China during WWII time, as she never took part in any major battle pre-1944 due to her high consumption and her status as IJN's flagship. Referred the same in-game as for same reason.  
** In the Kancolle anime,Yamato seems to dislike being called a hotel as she felt that she was not fulfilling her duty as a kanmusu due to the same reason stated above.
[[File:Sock.jpg|thumb|130px|'Hirihoukenten' sock]]
* Yamato's remodel art features a 'Hirihoukenten (非理法権天)' kneesock (originally a flag). It reflects one of the old philosophy in feudal Japan where foolishness (非) is not above sensibility (理), sensibility is not above law (法), law is not above authority (権), and authority is not above divinity (天). As the emperor was treated as a divine figure in imperial Japan it has a meaning of "no men can oppose the (divine) emperor". A slogan adopted by the Imperial Japanese navy, this flag was hung on Yamato on her final voyage towards Okinawa.

*Sunk 7 April 1945 north of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa Okinawa] (at 30° 22′ 0″ N, 128° 4′ 0″ E) in the famed Operation Ten-Go, along with [[Yahagi]], [[Isokaze]], [[Kasumi]], [[Hamakaze]] and [[Asashimo]].
*Her damaged art is based on the historical damage dealt to her during Operation Ten-Go, as the American learned from their experience on sinking Musashi that it's better to focus torpedo attack on a single side of the target ship, in order to cause her to capsize. In Yamato's case, that's the port (left) side of her.
* Wreck discovered on August 1st, 1985, in 1,120 ft of water in the East China Sea 180 miles Southwest of Kyushu and North of Okinawa.
*She wears an Armband that resembles the Maritime signal Flag for the letter "Z", the Z flag played a major role in Japanese Naval History. On May 27, 1905, Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō raised the Z flag on his flagship the IJN Mikasa before the start of the Battle of Tsushima and the Z flag was raised on the [[Akagi]] on the eve of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. The raising of the flag means the following: "The fate of Imperial Japan hangs on this one battle; all hands will exert themselves and do their best."
