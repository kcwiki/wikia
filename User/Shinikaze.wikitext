 === '''Biography''' ===

 I've started became an Admiral since 18 October 2013 with [[Fubuki]] as my starter ship. As time flow, my ships become larger and larger. I married my [[Zuihou]] on 14 October 2014 and [[Hibiki]] on 16 June 2015.

My first event was on Spring 2014 ([[Spring 2014 Event|Java Sea and Darwin Port]]) and can't even complete E-2 back then. same goes to Summer 2014 ([[Summer 2014 Event|Operation AL/MI]]) that I gave up on E-3. First time I cleared an event was in Fall 2014 ([[Fall 2014 Event|Operation KON]]) and afterwards I always cleared all events.

I'm willing to help with in-game information but bad at editing wiki, so you can just ask me directly if you need some information from me.
