I'm just a lover of the Kantai Collecction universe, especially the characters [[Kitakami]], [[Kiso]], [[Z1]], [[Hiyou]], [[Furutaka]], [[Aoba]] and [[Jun'you]]

Completed 3 events in the game, had a few extras maps. I also like to read KanColle dōjin made by fans. I play KanColle everyday, i mean... yes, KanColle is specially my favorite game.

We will improve this wiki, maybe some day we will have a good number of articles.

Pleased to meet you all, and leave your personal message on [[Message Wall:Kittynettee]]

==Waifu/Shipfu==
[[File:Married_waifu.png|thumb|left|316px|Married Kiso in 12/23/2014. ]]Kiso was my first reason to play KanColle, Kiso today is my eternal waifu, I just love her with all my strength and i always protect she in the game. 
Before I met her, i never felt so loving. Perhaps, I've always had these feelings and it was really dense about it. These feelings only developed so late since I got to know her more. With her next to me it seems that I can be happy more.
Well, Kiso is a good character.
