Name: Green Moriyama (森山 供林 ''moriyama gurin'')<br />Birth/Birthplace: Sept 6, 1992/Osaka, Japan<br />Current Locations: Osaka, Japan; Stanford, California, United States of America

An admiral/TTK just fluttering around the docks. Stocks up mounds of supplies from nowhere (?). Loves all of his ''kanmusu'' like close family and tags along with their requests. Loves to read native and foreign literature in his free time when no paperwork is stacked.

Although I do play the game, I will be avoiding chatter here. More or less, I'm here to help with the JP->EN translations as that is my area of expertise (when time permits). [[Akebono]], [[Hatsuharu]], [[Kuroshio]], and [[Yamato]] are my precious ''temp''-wives. Otherwise, good voyage to all admirals and may your sorties go well.
