This guy here is a Filipino. However, his passport suggests that he is of British Nationality - which by obtaining British citizenship about a decade ago - he probably is.

He is a guy who is very passionate about KanColle - despite only playing it for about a month. However he has set his sights on levelling up an Asashio Class Destroyer to Level 99 and making her his KanColle waifu - that destroyer is Arashio.

Will this guy who is neither sure about his nationality nor his current life situation be able to pull off such a feat? Find out in about a couple of months.

[Edit] This person also has a dislike for using the first-person, the reason for this is pretty much an enigma.
