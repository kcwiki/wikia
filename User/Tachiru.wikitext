== Who're You? ==
I'm Tachiru, or Tach for short. I play KanColle from time to time. Personally I haven't done events because I just don't feel ready for them. I probably could've done Normal before fleet locking became a thing. I don't consider myself a pro player. Just someone w/ cool ships, but not the best equipment atm. And not enough AA auto-cannibalism.

Apparently I was really lucky, in the early Winter of 2013, December. I joined the game on my first try thanks to the concise directions on this site. And on the first five builds, I got '''Shimakaze''' and '''Yukikaze, and''' I got '''I-168''' shortly afterwards. '''Abukuma '''was also obtained w/in that week. I'd say I had some decent luck, I dunno about you.

Needless to say, my luck ran out shortly afterwards.
