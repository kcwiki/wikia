*Did Medium E5 because the reward for hard is not worth it at all.
*Failed to obtain {{ShipLink|Houston}} after 102 runs. 

Probably the longest event ever with 6.4 weeks due to delayed EO and Friend fleet releases.

E1 to E3 is ridiculously easy even at Hard. As long as you have some Type 3 Shells and LBAS prepared, you will have no problem with it. E4 is a bit harsher due to the boss' armor but it's a typical boss map. The map itself is easy. E5 can be really annoying if done on Hard due to but preboss Subnode annoyance then the double CV Hime at boss.

E6...I ain't gonna sugarcoat this shit. This one is one of the hardest map in KC. The path to boss is tough, the debuff is quite brutal (Node V S-rank of hell) and the boss node is a beast. The boss itself is a mixed as she's not as strong as "KITANDA" due to historical buffs but her meatshields are another level on HARD. Two BB-Oni hime aren't a joke, and the double Ne-class Kai are also monsters. 

Overall, this map is truly painful and I'm happy to luck out Last Dance by clearing it in 1 run.

'''Luck sack: Clear + Grecale in 1 run'''

[[File:Zenom_E3_DONE_lucksack.png|400px]]

This event is actually easy as long as you pass the equipment check, which is anti-installation gears. The more of these you have, the easier. The hardest part turns out to be E-2 as there is no gimmick nor debuff on this one. It's the classic fight with the addition of Friend fleet that barely does anything (hope it sinks escort if it's alive). 

One thing that became a norm this event is "PT Imp Pack" in either escorts/main fleet. This will likely come back in the future so it will definitely be fun to deal with them when fighting installation boss.

Too lazy (no time) to deal with 2 Re-elite in E5. Reward for Hard isn't worth much compared to medium.

This is one of the event in which you'll find the bosses quite easy while the map itself being the main dish. Your other main enemy this event turns out to be lack of seaplane fighters because these maps hate CVs.

At worst, do Medium+ for E-1, Casual+ for E-2 and Easy+ for E-3 to make the most out of this event without feeling like losing much. Land-based Recon-aircraft is the true reward of this event. It increases the range of your LBAS range around the level of Catalina but comes with giving bonus damage to your:
*Sortie-mode air power by x1.15
*Airstrike damage by x1.125
*Air Defense-mode air power by x1.18
The skilled one is even better and you should try out E-2 Medium+ at least to obtain it.

E-1 is an exception as the main problem came from our limited shot vs. 6 ships, making boss support mandatory until Friend fleet was implemented. Murasame is MVP because obviously.

E-2 is just unlocking-fest with double BB-hime being the true boss of this map. Focusing either your LBAS (or Nelson/Nagato touch) there will increase your clearing chance tremendously. Boss itself is a pushover. Having no Touch here hurts. Bonus from historical ships aren't much of a problem.

E-3 is where it's a mix of both; the horrible boss of E-1 and the nightmare pre-boss of E-2. Prepare to face Loli-sub again...and if you unlock secret path (because who wants to fight double Elite Re-class)....TWICE. Better have Toukai or you'll be having heart attack at an alarming rate. Boss itself can also be problematic if your LBAS does not do their job. Historical DDs here are crucial in making your life easy although not mandatory.

Overall, the event became "Unlock all these shits" instead of "BEAT THE FUCKING BOSS!". Quite lackluster compared to other events despite the final boss being god damm cool. Based on Amaterasu? Sign me up!
