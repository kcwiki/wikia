__NOTOC__
Developers [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/438574201809543168 tweet] has reported that the {{Sonar}} equipment will give bonus accuracy against enemy submarines. Further verification has been performed on 検証 [http://ja.kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%83%89:1015 here].

==Summary==
Confirmed:
* Sonar gives accuracy bonuses against enemy submarines. This does not apply to Depth Charges.
* The accuracy bonus you obtain depends on the amount of {{ASW}} stats of a sonar. Under red morale, it is shown that every {{ASW}} stat equals to +1% hit rate.
* The bonus is shown to work on AO and AVs as well.
* Improving sonars will increase the ASW accuracy. The value is estimated to be around +4% on ★10.

Needs verification:
* Logical assumption is that the accuracy bonuses are not affected by morale in any way, which would mean that the accuracy bonus should also be +1% for every {{ASW}} stat under normal morale. However, this was never really confirmed.
* With the introduction of {{ShipLink|Taiyou/Kai Ni|text=Taiyou}}, the question has been raised whether this bonus also applies to light carriers.
* It is currently unknown whether large sonars also provide the same bonuses as the regular sonars.
* It is unknown whether sonar accuracy improvements scale linearly or not, nor do we actually know the exact improvement value. The [http://akashi-list.me/#w046 akashi-list.me] currently has the sonar accuracy improvement value listed as 1.3, which naturally brings it to 4.11 at ★10. Unfortunately, I cannot draw the same definitive conclusion with the data I currently have, so I'm wondering what they know that I don't know.

==[[User:KenWWK|KenWWK]]'s Analysis==
The first analysis was performed by [[User:KenWWK|KenWWK]].
[[File:ファイル-268.png|500px]]
* The first sample is tested with a {{EquipmentLink|Type 93 Passive Sonar|icon=x|text=T93 Sonar}} + {{EquipmentLink|Type 94 Depth Charge Projector|icon=x|text=T94 DCP}} setup. With a sample size of 511, it has a recorded hit rate of 90.41%
* The second sample is tested with a {{EquipmentLink|Type 93 Passive Sonar|icon=x|text=T93 Sonar}} + {{EquipmentLink|Type 93 Passive Sonar|icon=x|text=T93 Sonar}} setup. The sample size is 502, recording a hit rate of 96.41%

This confirms the following thing:
* The accuracy bonus seems to only work for Sonars, notably as the sample with a Depth Charge instead has a lower recorded hit rate.

But it also brings up the following:
* What is the exact accuracy boost you gain from Sonars? Does using different Sonars make any differences? This is currently hard to tell, due to 97% being the accuracy soft-cap.
* This test has only confirmed DDs so far. It is safe to assume CL gain the same bonus, but what about AO and AV?

==[https://twitter.com/kankenRJ/status/813545025770401792 kankenRJ]'s Analysis==
The Ryuujou guy also did some tests, using a tranport (I assume he means AO with this?) and AV instead, with all of them under red morale. The results are rather interesting.

The following interesting points can be observed:
* The {{EquipmentLink|Type 4 Passive Sonar|icon=x|text=T4 Sonar}} is shown to give a higher accuracy bonus compared to the {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}. This means that bonuses are different, depending on what kind of Sonar you use.
* A {{EquipmentLink|Type 4 Passive Sonar|icon=x|text=T4 Sonar}} gives around +1% more hit rate than the {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}. If we count both the {{ASW}} and {{Hit}} stats together of both equipment, you will get 12 vs 13. This is a strong sign of {{ASW}} stat being the cause of the increased hit rate.
* As this test was done using transports and AV, this is also a strong confirmation that the bonus applies to any ship capable of equipping Sonars.

But then, the following question remains:
* If the assumption is that each {{ASW}} of a Sonar increases the hit rate by +1%, would it be +2% for each {{ASW}} stat under normal morale?
* Does this bonus also apply to {{ShipLink|Taiyou/Kai Ni|text=Taiyou}}, being the only exception among the CVLs in the game?
* Does Large Sonars grant the same bonuses as the regular sonars?

==[[User:にら|にら]]'s Analysis==
[[User:にら|にら]] used this opportunity to also run some [https://twitter.com/nicolai_2501/status/814035772453974016 tests], but in order to test the sonar improvements instead. As shown in the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MAsxFxl233Jx2GhZR_nYLEhN_dOu7kA1S89WSMYXD2Y/edit#gid=0 spreadsheet], all the ships are of a similar level and under red morale. They all use the same setup, but with the difference being in the improvement levels.
* {{ShipLink|Yuudachi/Kai Ni}} scores a 68.56% hit rate using {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}} / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}} / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|icon=x|text=T3 DCP}}★6
* {{ShipLink|Ayanami/Kai Ni}} scores a 72.96% hit rate using {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}★10 / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}} / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|icon=x|text=T3 DCP}}★6
* {{ShipLink|Kasumi/Kai Ni}} scores a 76.28% hit rate using {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}★10 / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}★10 / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|icon=x|text=T3 DCP}}★6

Due to all the samples being combined together, the above statistics isn't really going to help us much in determining accurately as to what the estimated improvement value is for each ★. However, it does prove that improving sonars will increase your ASW accuracy, that much is certain.

If we want to draw a more detailed conclusion, we have to look at the table in which they split the samples based on the enemy ship and formation. The following are samples against a {{ShipLink|Subarine So-Class Flagship|text=So-class Flag}} in Echelon:
* {{ShipLink|Yuudachi/Kai Ni}} scores a 60.31% hit rate using {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}} / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}} / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|icon=x|text=T3 DCP}}★6.
* {{ShipLink|Ayanami/Kai Ni}} scores a 64.83% hit rate using {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}★10 / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}} / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|icon=x|text=T3 DCP}}★6. The difference seems to be 4.52% for having a fully improved {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}.
* {{ShipLink|Kasumi/Kai Ni}} scores a 68.54% hit rate using {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}★10 / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|icon=x|text=T3 Sonar}}★10 / {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|icon=x|text=T3 DCP}}★6. Compared to using only 1 fully improved T3 Sonar, using 2 of them instead will give you a higher hit rate of around 3.71%.

Sadly, there's not really much we can draw out of this, except the fact that improving a sonar will also improve the ASW accuracy and that the ASW accuracy value is close to around +4% when fully improved.

There is simply still too much things we don't know to properly draw all the information out of the tables, examples being that we still lack an ASW accuracy formula and also the fact that we still don't know what the exact formation modifier values are of the combined fleet. Don't even get me started on why the results of the enemies in Line Abreast all look so weird, I will have to look this over again once more is known about the accuracy formula.
