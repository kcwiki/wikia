I'm mainly just lurking around. <:3c

I play Kancolle since May 2014 but I'm not always an active player. There may be times when I don't log in for several weeks due to private life. I suck at saving ressources so they're pretty low all the time, despite my HQ level. The only extra operations I do every month are 1-5 and 1-6 because the others are too bothersome. o)--< 

When I'm not playing Kancolle I usually draw, watch anime, play other video games (preferably PC or 3DS) or hang out with friends.
