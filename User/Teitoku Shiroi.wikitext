Well met. Teitoku Shiroi over here. You're free to call me Shiroi, or pretty much anything else if you come up with a clever nickname; as long as it's not insulting.

I'm not that good at KanColle. I registered in the game around February, and only started playing around March because I'm lazy. Despite taking it casually and not being too dedicated to it, I enjoy it. And since the game is enjoyable, why shouldn't someone join a wiki community page? (In fact, I've come over to the chat several times, but mostly logged through my facebook and never bothered to make an actual account before. But I was envious because everyone had a profile picture and I didn't. So I figured I'd just make an actual profile.)

I have several favourite ships, like Kongou, Yuubari, Suzuya, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kaga, i-19, Hibiki, the Nuclear test fodder, Sonic the Hedgehog, and others.

My starter ship was Sazanami.
