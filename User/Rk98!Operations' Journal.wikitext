{{!}} style="text-align:center;border-color:;background-color:#D6FFDB"{{!}}<span style="color:black">After wiping out the ABDA undeads and mopping up the escapees from Java Island, we are under order to sail to Australia. Or to be exact, where Port Darwin used to be. Heard that Abyssal set up a base there, and we were under order to demolish it. OK, fine. But the problem is, we don't have much Type 3 shells at that time. So, I just tell the factory people and a couple of girls to do research to build it. After building enough stack, we go boom boom the HVT. </span>

{{!}} style="text-align:center;border-color:;background-color:#D6FFDB"{{!}}<span style="color:black">So we are cool after mopping up Darwin and setting it up as temporary base. Next is an invasion to Wake Island. But first, we have to do some fishing in the waters in its front door. We're getting reports that there's a new enemy sub type lurking around there. Turns out is a creepier juggernaut subs .... with some flak on her head? What's she going to do with that? Mixed cut in with AA shells and torps? And not just that, she has a fully armed carrier task force right in her front, erecting a goddamn wall and they say, "You shall not pass!". But if we give up here, God knows another chance to grab that super engine. So fuck them. I ain't letting them getting AS+ to hit my fragile DDs, CLs so I tasked Akagi and her air wings to take down the enemy bombers. After some salts and joy, we finally managed to get through. And the next Ops? BIG MEH. For taking down 2 thick-boss type enemy is something we ain't ready for at that time. </span>

Operation Hailstone=

For the Combined Fleet operating in the Pacific, the Truk Anchorage was one of the vital bases for their operation back in the World War II, considered as [http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=14 "home-away-from-home for the Combined Fleet vessels operating in the South and Central Pacific"]. 
<br>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<p> And apparently it is still in this new era. For a year and a half since the project "Kantai Collection" began, and the atoll was rebuilt as a naval base for the shipgirls, it is mostly peaceful. However, sometime in the eve of Winter 2014, the CAP elements stationed there were starting to spot more frequent unidentified movements. At first, it was only one or two rogue submarines, small fries for the ASW aircraft to take care of. But around a week later, they are getting struck by bombs and torpedoes, heavily damaged at least two DDGs in the lagoon. 
<p> The Yokosuka headquarters received the call for help from Truk 30 minutes after the 7th bombing raid on the atoll. Responding the situation, the top brass organized large reinforcement parties comprised from all branch bases' elements. The re-run of Operation Hailstone, is about to begin. </p>

*'''Chapter 1 - The Departure '''
<p> On the morning of February 6, 2014, all guardian offices' elements are departing toward Truk Anchorage in the Pacific Ocean. The Kanoya detachments were transported by a Scinfaxi-class submarine, Ivan Rogov-class Landing Ships, escorted by numerous destroyers, cruisers and nuclear submarines. Around 14.55 JST, the Scinfaxi's captain received another radio message from Truk that the surrounding waters are under siege by enemy submarines and torpedo squadrons, therefore posing danger for incoming reinforcements. As such, it is decided that ally torpedo squadrons must be deployed to make contact with the Truk's base command, and coordinate with their remaining forces to eliminate the threats. </p>
*'''Chapter 2 - Operation Verusan'''
<p> After looking at my roster to decide who's going for the first phase of operation, I decided that a fleet composed of 3CLs and 3DDs must be deployed for highest firepower possible to counter a mix of underwater and surface threats. Unlike the previous Ops where high-ranking skippers' forces must be at the frontline at all times, and the lower rank only act as the backup, we can pick on what kind of ops we are going to join. Like my old days back in Belkan War. To simplify it, let's call it Operation A,B, and C.
*Operation A (甲):
*Operation B (乙):
*Operation C (丙):
