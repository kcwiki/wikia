[[File:Ashigara_kantai_collection_drawn_by_hizaka_sample-aaf965f8c8eb80ae84a363caf76bd5e0.jpg|thumb|Only LOVE FTW!]]

Early-in-game Admiral. Playing because love to the World War II naval history and weeb in real life. World of Warships, Silent Hunter and Fighting Steel fan.




Favourite class: Myoukou sisters FTW! With '''Ashigara''' as '''BEST GIRL''' and '''only Kantai Collection wife'''.

Independent, strong, proud, world person which has she visited many places in the world, which has she met many important characters and participated in many important events, who she always wanted to be victorious but in deep inside she is normal and a little bit crazy girl in positive way.  When I meet her first time it was like love from the first sight :


When I was kid I buy a book about Myoukou class heavy cruisers, this possibly started my love to this class. Anime only deepend my feelings.

List of my shipgirls:

The characters in game that I am looking for the most: Pola - droped in E-2 Early Fall 18, Hayashimo - droped in E-5 Early Fall 18, Yamakaze and Unryuu class. Hope they can be obtinable in upcoming event.

Most hunted normally obtinable characters: Taigei, Zuikaku. 

I like the most strong characters but apart from that there are place for intelectuallists, drinking and peaceful charaters and this with sad and dark personalities.

Other favourie shipgirls: Houshou, Myoukou class, Pola, Nagato, Fusou, Yamashiro, Chitose, Natori, Jintsuu, Shigure,  Hayashimo and Natori. But sympathy to them can't be even compared to Ashigara. 

Disliked: Kongou ( Kongou pls staph you BURNIN RABU RETARD TEAM LEADER, pls STAPH! - I swear I scrap you one beautiful day EDIT - I scrapped THIS shit! I will scrap You again and again ), Agano, Yahagi, Musashi, Yuudachi, hate for all siscon (except Yamashiro because my fascination for Battle in Surigao strait), german ships, I-8, Ooi, Aoba, almost all Mutsukis however I appreciate them as very useful in expeditions.
