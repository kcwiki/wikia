* Alias: nyoro
* Started White Day 2015 on Saiki Bay Anchorage.Server ^^; <s>Currently HQ:112</s>
* Last Map Finished 6-5 and 5-5, ugh I hate it again, thanks Phase II. Why no more orel...

* 03/10/20 - Stupid mini-hishimochi event broke me, retiring for good. Can't deal with these multi-part maps anymore. I'm sorry to all my girls, you may be waiting, but it's not worth my time and sanity to come back. It's been a wonderful 5 years. 
** To my eight ringed girls, I'll love you forever. Shoukaku (prekai-ni), Fusou, Haguro, Katsuragi, Samidare, Amatsukaze, Teruzuki and Zara.
