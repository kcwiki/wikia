Kantai Collection playa. Level 105. Not really an avid player, but I know a thing or two about this game after I cashed in around a few thousand pesos and hours into this.

I absolutely love this game, but it gets repetitive (at least during the no-event period) and its usually just me pressing buttons to train at 3-2A or 5-3 or somewhere else.

Programming student. Python and all that bullshit. Java can suck my ass. Screw you too C++. Web developement, yeah HTML/CSS/MySQL screw em all.

If you read this far, you're a cool dude. Add me on [https://steamcommunity.com/id/sporadictoast/ Steam] and let's hang.

Kamusta mga Pilipino dyan :) Pagkauwi sa school KanColle nalang tyo!
