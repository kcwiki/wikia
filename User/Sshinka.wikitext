== Hello All! ==
.

I played Kancolle since New Year's Eve 2014-2015, and i left it on 03.01.2016.

Over the time the Game became too tedious for my taste and i scrapped enough of Waifus and the rarest ships - to burn the bridges. My dearest girls will maybe greet someone in pvp from time to time, as i left them in fleet 1.

To be perfectly honest, i lost my interest in the game when it was announced that USN Shipgirls will be coming into the game. Since then i barely played kancolle. Last thing my girls did was my waifu fleet failing to clear 4-5  five times in a row, which resulted in ragescrapping and ragequitting.

At the time i left, i was missing only Yamato and Musashi, besides them my Kandex was full.

Everyone.. I don't know what to say really.. Maybe just a big thanks for all the help you gave me when i was a newbie, and all the fun i had with you in the Kancolle wiki chat. 

Live long and good!  I'm Out.

-Shinka.

I loved all my girls, but i especially liked Yuudachi! - Besides her obvious charms, She got me through my first (2015. Winter) Event by wrecking all the bosses to pieces. :) She has been with me ever since and helped me pass many obstacles in KanColle.

My Grandfather served on German Submarines, and later on Wilhelm Gustloff. Many Books on Naval Warfare were left behind him, so, being into Naval Warfare for as long as i can remember, i also knew about IRL IJN Yuudachi, and her heroic actions at Guadalcanal since i was a kid.
