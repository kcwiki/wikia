I"ll only check through the pages for spelling errors, not adding facts, items, or something trivial to contribute the page (well, kinda). Just to let people know, I may miss some words while doing a spelling check.

<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Self made rules for myself while doing my job:</span>

- found many American and British (probably more) english kind of mixing while scanning through pages. Not changing spellings of either sides of english. (Examples: color, colour; authorize, authorise; remodeling, remodelling) (I'm American btw)

- only change the spelling when there is a stub on a word (kind of obvious)

- never vandalize or tamper the pages

- I don't do grammar changes, as I'm afraid that I would mess up the accuracy of the information and translations.(may be hypocritical on this rule, but swear no big changes)
