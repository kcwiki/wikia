==Introduction==
Hello everyone, this is Death Usagi.

This is a newly revised Guide that will help you power level your beloved Destroyers (DD) and Light Cruisers (CL) in World 4-3!

This guide is to give you guidance in order to help your DD/CL obtain MVP consistently in World 4-3 to level up efficiently.

Please read through this Guide thoroughly to know the strategy to have your DD/CL level up consistently throughout your runs.

==World 4-3 Map==

[[File:4-3_Map_Edit.jpg|thumb|center|600px]]

The Strategy of World 4-3 Power Leveling is to have your DD or CL Flagship that you wish to level up gain MVP in nodes F and D or K consistently.

There may be times where you are sent to node J and by 1/3 chance face the {{ShipLink|Battleship Ta-Class Flagship}} Enemy Fleet from that node, but depending on your own luck, you may get away with it, or come out with a Medium-Damaged Ship or be forced to retreat immediately due to a Ship(s) getting Heavily Damaged from the battle...

|-|DD/CL (Flagship)=
===Destroyer or Light Cruiser [Flagship]===
*The Flagship Destroyer/Light Cruiser is the Ship you are focusing to Power Level.
**She is to be equipped with a Full Anti-Submarine Warfare Setup, generally the setup of Two {{Sonar}} SONARs and One {{DepthCharge}} Depth Charge Projector, and is recommended that they are your best ones (Ex. {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar}} or {{EquipmentLink|Type 4 Passive Sonar}} and {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector}}).
**She must be able to have a clean Critical Hit against Two Enemy Submarines to gain MVP.

===Battleships (BB/BBV/FBB)===
*The Battleship that you bring to World 4-3 as a Support have the following roles:
**Take down Enemies in node J easily (including {{ShipLink|Battleship Ta-Class Flagship}}).
**Take down Non-Submarine Enemies in Nodes D / F / K immediately if there are any alive after the Opening Airstrike.
**Enable 2nd Shelling Phase.
*To save your resources per run as much as possible, it is recommended that you limit yourself to bring only 1 Battleship.

|-|Aircraft Carrier=
===Aircraft Carriers (CV)===
*An Aircraft Carrier's Role as a Support here is of the following:
**Be able to take down Enemies with ease in Node J.
**To be able to bring {{YellowPlane}}{{EquipmentLink|Saiun}} in order to disable <span style="color:red">Red T Disadvantage</span>.
**Take out Non-Submarine Enemies in Submarine Nodes D / F / K via Opening Airstrike, and not interfere any further.
====Things to Watch Out For====
*'''DO NOT BRING A LIGHT CARRIER (CVL) or ARMORED CARRIER (CVB)!'''
**Due to the fact CVLs can attack Submarines, they will ruin your Flagship DD/CL's Attack Pattern in the Submarine Nodes, which will result in MVP loss.
**CVBs are just too expensive to use as a Support for Power Leveling, especially more so since you are already bringing a Battleship.
*Avoid using expensive Carriers like {{ShipLink|Kaga}} and {{ShipLink|Akagi}} for the sake of resource consumption per run, but if you have no choice due to lacking other properly leveled Carriers, then please use them at your discretion.
**You may lower the Resource Cost per run if you choose to bring only 1 CV.
*'''DO NOT USE POWERFUL BOMBERS!'''
**Powerful Bombers such as {{EquipmentLink|Ryuusei Kai}} and {{EquipmentLink|Tenzan Model 12 (Tomonaga Squadron)}} can result in your Aircraft Carrier stealing MVP in Submarine Nodes due to their high potential to bring out an overwhelming damage output.
***You can use them however if you choose to bring only 1 Bomber on your CV.
**You are recommended to use Average Bombers such as {{EquipmentLink|Type 97 Torpedo Bomber (Skilled)}}, and {{EquipmentLink|Tenzan}}.
***Please note that even then, by rare occurence, the CV may still somehow be able to steal MVP...

|-|Light Cruiser=
===Support Light Cruisers===
*Due to World 4-3's Branching Rules, you are only allowed to bring 1 maximum Destroyer to be able to take the route to Nodes D / F / K. Even if you were leveling a Light Cruiser, bringing a Destroyer as Support is a bad idea.
*The Supporting Light Cruiser's job is to help take down any outstanding Submarines that the Main Flagship you are leveling cannot take down due to the limit of how many times she can attack.
**Please note that sometimes a Support Light Cruiser can steal MVP if the Main Flagship by some unfortunate RNG, has one of her attacks miss against the enemy Submarine(s). 
**When facing Enemy Submarines Pattern #1 in Nodes D / F / K, there are times where a Support Light Cruiser may not be able to fully take down the remaining Enemy Submarines which will only result in A-Rank Victory (resulting in 990 EXP instead of 1188 EXP from S-Rank), which case can be common when the Battle is under Head-On engagement, or if the Support Light Cruiser outright causes her attack(s) to miss by some unfortunate RNG.
*It is recommended that you bring a full-fledged Light Cruiser who has gone through full [[Modernization]] (Anti-Air is optional), and is fully remodeled.
====Standard Light Cruisers====
*The following below are for a Light Cruiser without any special abilities. Such Light Cruisers include ships such as {{ShipLink|Nagara/Kai|Natori/Kai|text=Nagara & Natori}}, {{ShipLink|Kuma/Kai|Tama/Kai|text=Kuma/Tama}}, and the {{ShipLink|Sendai|Naka|Jintsuu|text=Sendai-class}}.

*Slightly higher ASW capabilities but not to the point it will steal MVP from the Flagship unless it has one of her attacks miss. 
*'''DO NOT USE A {{Sonar}} SONAR WITH THIS SETUP'''

===Torpedo Cruisers===
*As the title literally says, the following are designated for a Torpedo Cruisers who are capable of using Opening Torpedo Strike with the use of the Equipment {{TorpedoWeapon}} {{EquipmentLink|Kouhyouteki}} this also includes Pseudo-Torpedo Cruisers who are actually Light Cruisers such as {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}} and {{ShipLink|Yura/Kai Ni}}.
**Please note that you are not recommended to use {{ShipLink|Ooi/Kai}} and {{ShipLink|Kitakami/Kai}} as their capabilities are too low in their non-Kai Ni form. If you wish to use Ooi and Kitakami, please use them after they have been remodeled to Kai Ni. 
*Due to their consistent support in all nodes, rather than standard Light Cruisers, you are more recommended to use CLTs or {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}}/{{ShipLink|Yura/Kai Ni}} as Support Ships.

==Formation Considerations==
===Node J===
'''Line Ahead''' always. You must take down the enemies immediately so that you can proceed to the Submarine nodes. 
===Node D / F / K (The Submarine Nodes)===
'''Line Abreast''' always for the best Anti-Submarine Damage Modifier. You should be familiar with Basic Anti-Submarine Warfare Game Mechanics if you have done World 1-5 frequently.

==Nodes and Enemy Encounters==
===Nodes D / F / K (The Submarine Nodes)===
*Nodes D / F / K Submarine Nodes all have the exact same Enemy Fleet Patterns.
**Pattern 1 may sometimes result in A-Rank Victory instead of S-Rank due to Head-On (反航戦) Engagement, where your Supporting CL(T)s may sometimes have trouble taking down the {{ShipLink|Submarine Yo-Class Elite|Submarine Ka-Class Elite|text=Elite Variant Submarines}}.
***This happens less to none if your Flagship Destroyer/Light Cruiser can reach 100+ {{ASW}} and use [[Partials/Opening ASW|OASW]] Attack however.

===Node J (Randomly Sent Node)===
*Getting sent from START to node J is completely random and there are no Branching Rules that will let you specifically avoid this node. 
*Node J's Pattern #1 {{ShipLink|Battleship Ta-Class Flagship|text=Ta-Class}} Fleet is one of the biggest cause of being forced to retreat due to the potential of the Ta-Class being able to Heavily Damage one or two of your ships if she isn't taken down quickly. 
**Using 2 CLT (Kai Ni Only) and 2 CVs in your Fleet can help you lessen the chance of this happening.
*Pattern #2 with the {{ShipLink|Heavy Cruiser Ri-Class Flagship|text=Ri-Class Flagship}} Fleet can sometimes force you to retreat as well, but the chance of this happening is actually quite rare.

<!--
==Facts to Consider==

*Going to Node F or J from the start is completely '''RANDOM'''. There is absolutely no Branching rules that lets you avoid going to node J. 
*Bringing CAV will take you from node J to K, which means only one submarine node. '''<span style="color:red">DO NOT BRING CAV</span>'''.
*Bringing 2 or more DD will take you from Start to A, which will make you go off course. '''Only bring 0 to 1 DD maximum'''.
*Unfavorable situations WILL HAPPEN.
**If the compass takes you to node J, there are possibilities of being forced to retreat because of one of your ships going into Heavy Damage.
**The enemy Elite Submarines sometimes by rare chance, is able to make one of your ship go into Medium or even Heavy Damage despite being in Echelon or Line Abreast Formation. IT CAN HAPPEN.
*The enemy will attack your support ships, which can damage them bit by bit, even if they are minor damages. However it will build up which will require you to repair the support ships.
*If your Flagship DD or CL somehow goes into Moderate Damage due to getting hit by an enemy in node J or by a Submarine due to some random chance, expect her to have a harder time obtaining MVP due to the lowered damage output.
*'''Do not bring equip any SONAR on CL/CLTs that will reach 100 or higher ASW stats after equipping it'''. This will cause them to be able to attack 3 times via OASW (Opening ASW Strike), stealing MVP from your main DD/CL Flagship. If you are going to bring a CL/CLT who will reach 100 or higher ASW stat, equip them with a Depth Charge instead. 
*Please refrain from bringing Isuzu Kai Ni into this map as a Support Ship due to the reasons stated on the above paragraph. 
==Tips & Recommendations==
*Type 3 Depth Charge and SONAR gives the best output compared to Type 94 Depth Charge and Type 93 SONAR.
*If using BBV, do not equip Zuiun because it will force her to attack submarines instead of the non-submarine enemies.
*If you want faster runs to power level your flagship DD or CL, rotating the support ships with other ships of the same type can make things faster. However beware that repairs may build up in the long run if using too many ships for rotation, which may become a problem for players with only 2 Repair Docks.
*Bringing CLTs as support has potential to minimize the damage done to you in node J.
*Unlike World 3-2A power leveling, this map will require you to either rest your ships every 1 to 2 sorties, or rotate the ships of the same/similar-type. However be warned that rotating too many different ships may cause your repairs to pile up...
*Submarines can minimize the damage done to you by the enemy DD/CLs but is highly risky as Node J contains a Flagship CL equipped with both SONAR and Depth Charge while Submarine Nodes may have 2 CLs in Echelon which can heavily damage your Submarine due to the Formation.

==FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)==
'''1. Why is the BB equipped with a Yellow Gun instead of Two Main Cannons?'''
:It is because if the BB is equipped with two Main Cannons, it has potential to steal MVP away from your Flagship DD/CL when you are facing against the 4 SS + 2 CL or 5 SS + 1 Wa-class Trasnport Ship due to triggering Double Attack. Even by using Cut-in Attack, its damage will be strong but not too big to steal MVP away from the Flagship DD/CL as the BB will most likely only attack once.

'''2. Why can't I use Torpedo Bomber on my CV?'''
:You can but it has high risks of stealing MVP away from your DD/CL because of its potential 1.8x damage multiplier. Dive Bomber only has 1x multiplier, which means moderate damage against the non-Submarine enemies without being huge that could outdamage your DD/CL's ASW damage. If 0.8x multiplier happened from the Torpedo Bomber, you might be safe but if not, then expect MVP getting stolen by your CV. In fact it is worse if you bring a CVL, as it does opening Aerial Bombing + attacks the submarine, which definitely steals MVP majority of the time (Happened to me before in the past). Happened to me before when I tried (Trial and Error!)

'''3. Why are the support CL or CLT equipped with a SONAR? Wouldn't that steal MVP?'''
:If you compare the main flagship DD/CL you are power leveling and the support CL/CLT being equipped with a single ASW equipment, the Flagship DD/CL has more damage output compared to the supporting CL/CLT who only has a single ASW equipment. The reason why the support CL/CLT is equipped with a SONAR is so they can take down even the Elite Submarines with a moderate damage output that's not big as the Flagship DD/CL's ASW damage output. In the past I have brought support CL/CLTs without any ASW equipment on them, but the issue with this was that the Elite (Red) Submarines, especially the Submarine Yo-class Elite, could not be taken down fully, which caused me to obtain only A Rank Victory. However after I added one SONAR to the support CL/CLT, they were able to take down the Elite Submarines without giving much big damage output.

As for stealing MVP, that never really happens unless
*Flagship DD/CL's attack somehow misses (it does happen sometimes...)
*Flagship DD/CL is Moderate/Heavy Damaged.
*CLTs' Pre-emptive Torpedo Strike somehow happens to hit the non-Submarine enemies in the Submarine Nodes (Line Abreast makes rate of Torpedoes hitting the enemy very low)
*Your CL/CLT support has 100+ ASW and has a SONAR equipped. 

'''4. So what is the difference between using a Type 0 Recon Seaplane and using a SONAR on the support CL?'''
:If you want to have the support CL be able to use Double Attack in Node J to increase your survivability there, you could just go with the Type 0 Recon Plane, but if you want more reliability in the support CL taking down the Elite Submarines in the Submarine nodes, then go with SONAR, but expect it will lose its Artillery Spotting Effect as it won't be equipped with a Type 0 Recon Seaplane. [[Ooyodo|Ooyodo Kai]] is exempt from this as she has 4 Equipment Slots which will allow you to equip both Type 0 Recon Seaplane and a SONAR, allowing Double Attack in Node J while supporting your Flagship DD/CL in the Submarine Nodes.
'''5. Can I still use this setup if I don't have a Saiun?'''
:You can, but expect to face some T-Cross Red Disadvantage situations which will most likely make you unable to take down the entire enemy fleet in the Submarine Nodes.
Recommended Recipe for making Saiun is '''20/60/10/111'''.
==Conclusion==
Unlike Power Leveling your BB, CV(L) and CA in World 3-2 Node A, leveling DD/CL is more extensive because of being required to use a bit more resource expensive fleet and having to repair them. You always have World 1-5 to power level your DD/CL, but in the long run it gets very tiring and may take a very long time to level up your ship since the maximum EXP you could get per run is 1620 EXP (node A to C with rank S victory all the time: 540 EXP x3) in contrast to World 4-3's 2376 (2 Submarine Nodes with S Rank Victory: 1188 x2)~2970 (+594 EXP from node J) EXP gain per run.

Also the fact 1-5 is out of the question once you reach Level 80+ HQ unless you are leveling a DD/CL who can reach 100 ASW after equipping 2 SONAR and 1 Depth Charge. 

I use this setup all the time now to power level my DD/CL, and unless some derp situations happen, my DD/CL gets MVP all the time.

I hope this Guide will help you power level your beloved DD/CL girls efficienctly, and hope you enjoy the game!

Thank you for reading.
