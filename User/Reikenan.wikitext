'''<u>Medals for Performance</u>'''

'''Hiryuu<sup>96</sup> - Medal of Valor '''-''' '''Performed above expectations during Summer 15', commanding the Tomonaga Squadron to bring down the Anti-Aircraft Princess with a precise torpedo strike to sink her.

'''Maya<sup>79 </sup>- Medal of Aegis '''- Performed effectively during Fall 15', disabling enemy Wo-class aircraft carriers and protecting the fleet during the hunt for Prinz-chan and Graf-chan. (Yet we failed to get either of them)

'''Kawakaze<sup>22 </sup>- Medal of Guidance '''- Assisted during Fall 15', enabling superior routing during E-5, allowing me to effectively beat my first event finale on normal. Help from '''Shigure''' and '''Sendai''' was also much appreciated.
