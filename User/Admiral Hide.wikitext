Hello! Admiral Hide here.

Kind of late starter, I only began playing around two months before Fall Event 2016. To be honest, I had known Kancolle as a franchise long before that (mostly from either pixiv, danbooru and R-18 doujins). I was reluctant to join at that time due to multiple reasons, such as language barrier, the need of VPN and lottery. Fast forward to middle-end of 2016, I felt compelled to finally give Kancolle a try as I started to get tired of MMORPG.

I enjoy anime in general and anything related to it (music, Illust, drama cd, voice acting etc.), which is why I felt attracted to Kancolle. Rookie and veterans seiyuu alike contribute in this franchise, which I think is amazing. They get to show off by voicing multiple characters, some of the biggest shining examples are Sakura Ayane and Touyama Nao. However, I'm ultra clueless when it comes to Warships and WWII in general. 

My base of operation is Rabaul Naval base, where I go with name Hidetada. My first event was Fall 2016, where I failed spectacularly to save Saratoga, whom I have finally obtained through LSC, luckily with just few tries. I've been doing well in event ever since then because I learned well how to prepare, be it resources or essential ships needed for clearing with shiplocking in mind.''' '''Married to Yura Kai Ni on Friday, 22 September 2017 at 20.00 JST using my only ring. I picked her not only for sentimental reason (I just absolutely love everything about her) but also pragmatical side, where she as a Light Cruiser gains most benefits from marriage. With that, she'll be able to gain edge against her rival ace Abukuma Kai Ni.

That's pretty much about it. See you guys around!
