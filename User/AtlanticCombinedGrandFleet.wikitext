Admiral since 2019. Familiar with Kancolle since 2013.

Especially interested in the challenge of building up a mostly non-jp base with viable non-jp fleets (including equipment) inside an obviously jp-centered setting. Of course keeping lots of jp kanmusus too. No permanent dupes.

(unrelated note: I'm confident in my japanese language skills)
