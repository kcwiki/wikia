I've been playing Kantai Collection for almost a month now. I already knew the game from before, but i couldn't understand it, so i didn't pursue to play.  But i got really Bored, that "i should just go to school instead of staying home" type of bored, i decided to learn how to play it, Slowly, one step at a time, I finally learned about 80% about the game, I dont understand the Anti-Air Cut in.  I Love this game, the reason i played this game is because of the Anim-, No! its Because of the Akatsuki Class Destroyers! You can tell from my name.  

---If you read all that....Well Done!
