Hi!  

I mostly spend my day on tumblr, playing Kantai, or enthusing to my friend... About Kantai. I currently have Kongou K2, Zuikaku K2A, Naka K2, Shoukaku, Tatusuta, Tenryuu, and Shriatsuyu figurines.

I have a lot of bad luck. I could be called Shoukaku, actually. Trying forever to get her and her sister. I just keep getting unlucky. The one time I got Mutsu, I was later smashed in the face with a soccer ball. I can't even get Myoukou for her quest(the one that then allows you to arrange all the kongou sisters{i have them all though!}).
I somehow have Etorofu... That's lucky! 

I tend to 'curse' people when I cheer them on or say something. 

I like the fairy CGs. They're very cute! 

I'm currently HQ level 43(18/04/21). 


I love all my ships. They're like daughters!

Also, apparently, you can find your way with parallax. What?







Well! Let's all do our best! In Phase Two, I expect great things to come!
