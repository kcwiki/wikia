===Naval Base: Palmacosta===

Welcome to Palmacosta, Ghoulvarine's HQ! I am also known as Ari-kun, hailing from the Palau Islands. I started my adventure in the World of Kancolle on Nov 15, 2014 after successfully graduating from the Palau Anchorage Naval Academy. Kancolle is unlike anything I've experienced before and it's a lot of fun. I want to be a good Teitoku who looks after these adorable kanmusu! In the meantime, have fun looking around here. <(^_^<)

== About Admiral Ari-kun a.k.a. "Ghoulvarine" ==
(under construction)
== Palmacosta Base Facilities and Secret Projects ==
We have state of the art facilities that have global effects over my kanmusu and their equipment in battle. Together with my admiral abilities, allied victory is around every sea of conflict!

==== Maritime Control Center ====
[[File:The_Maritime_Control_Center.png|thumb|left|50px]]''"It is altogether fitting that we who have sailed the deeps of space now return again to the sea. This is in many ways a water planet, and it can be ruled from the waves. With sea power, rugged terrain can be bypassed and enemy strongholds isolated. Once naval superiority is achieved, Planet is ours for the taking." - Colonel Corazon Santiago, "Planet: A Survivalist's Guide"''

Effect: The cost and duration of ship repairs and ship building are reduced by half.

==== Cloudbase Academy ====
''[[File:The_Cloudbase_Academy.png|thumb|left|50px]]"In one dimension I find existence, in two I find life, but in three I find freedom." - Foreman Domai, Cadet Induction Ceremony, M.Y. 2216''
Effect: Provides bonus combat and scouting efficacy to all aircraft launched by CVs, CVLs, BBVs, CAVs, and SSVs. Minimum air superiority value needed is halved.

==== Flechette Defense System ====
''[[File:Flechette_Defense_System.png|thumb|left|50px]]Missile attack on Zeta-5. Humans activate : first defense successful. Afterwards : danger posed by innovation suddenly clear. - Usurper Judaa Marr, "Human : Nature"''
Effect: Ship anti-air values are doubled. Battle conditions cannot result in air incapability and air denial for allied ships.
==== Living Refinery ====
''[[File:The_Living_Refinery.png|thumb|left|50px]]"We estimate that during the next mission century most of Planet's industries will be moved off-planet to Nessus Prime and other orbital facilities. Many of our industries will benefit greatly from the low gravity environments available in space, particularly those involving genetically engineered microbes." - CEO Nwabudike Morgan, "The Centauri Monopoly"''
Effect: Resource consumption on sorties and expeditions are reduced by half.

==== Hunter-Seeker Algorithm ====
''[[File:The_Hunter-Seeker_Algorithm.png|thumb|left|50px]]"If I determine the enemy's disposition of forces while I have no perceptible form, I can concentrate my forces while the enemy is fragmented. The pinnacle of military deployment approaches the formless: if it is formless, then even the deepest spy cannot discern it nor the wise make plans against it." - Sun Tzu, "The Art of War"''
Effect: The effects of RADAR and SONAR are doubled.

==== Geosynchronous Survey Pod ====
''[[File:Geosynchronous_Survey_Pod.png|thumb|left|50px]]"The managers always talked about having the view from 30,000 feet. The only problem with having the view from 30,000 feet is that at that height everyone looks like ants." - Foreman Domai, "Genejack and the Beanstalk"''
Effect: Ship evasion, LoS, and accuracy values are increased by 50%. Increases the chance for artillery spotting by 50%.
==== Telepathic Matrix ====
''[[File:The_Telepathic_Matrix.png|thumb|left|50px]]"From the delicate strands, between minds we weave our mesh: a blanket to warm the soul." - Lady Dierdre Skye, "The Collected Poems"''
Effect: Ships cannot go below 20% morale value. Morale regeneration rates are doubled.

==== Subsea Trunkline ====
''[[File:Subsea_Trunkline.png|thumb|left|50px]]"Each individual pipe contains a hot slurry of minerals drawn from Planet's crust, and makes a sound like rain falling on a tin roof. When they converge at the trunkline, the sound becomes a terrifying thunder, a thunder of untold wealth and power." - Captain Ulrik Svensgaard, "Tending the Sea"''
Effect: Expedition times are reduced by half. Increases the chance of getting great success in expeditions by 50%.
