When i don't know what to do, usually i google the  history of the Warships featured in Kancolle. Like  hibiki's History : (from the wiki) 

Laid Down : February 21 , 1930

Launched :  June 16 , 1932 

Commisioned : March 31 , 1933

-  April 5 , 1947 -

Turned over to the Soviet Union as the prize of war.  With a new name of ' Verniy ' means ' Faithful '

- July 5 , 1948 -

Renamed as ' Dekabrist ' means ' Decembrist '

And Retired from service on February 20, 1953.

The truth is i can't remember all the detail but it's fun to read the history of Country , places and ofc Warships.

I got to know Kancolle is from my friend who play this game and introduce it to me. So i follow the facebook fanpage and start playing this game.

I'm Indonesian, I can speak english but usually wrong in grammar and i can speak

japanese and read some japanese letters ( Hiragana , Katakana and Kanji ) a little.
