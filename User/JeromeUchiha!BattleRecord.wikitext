|''"I equipped Fusou, Yamashiro, and Mogami with only 2 main guns, 1 recon, 1 seaplane fighter to achieve air superiority against enemy fleets. Shigure and Michisio have an anti-sub and double attack hybrid setup, with the help of Maya as AACI backup. Luckily, enemy battleships hit scratch damage only throughout the entire nodes. The ASW boss support expedition didn't do anything since no enemy submarines present at the boss node. Admiral out."''

|''"I'm sorry for risking taiha'd Furutaka engaging her in yasen on boss node with 2 Two shouha Ta-class battleships and a full health abyssal tranport left, but thanks to Aoba's star shell the tide of yasen has turned. All of you girls did a very good job on this quest. Admiral out."''

|''"I'll considered this as one of hardest quest I've been received, as Kirishima, Hiei, Akatsuki, Inazuma, Ikazuchi and Nagara will head to W5-1 with no air power at all. Using the support expedtion help them to soften the enemy fleet, but it is not enough to compensate air power and off-routing by the map itself. Going to Boss node needs luck, and good thing I've finally found it plus no enemy submarine are present that my fleet brings victory at night battle. Admiral out."''
|-

|''"It takes time for Asashimo and Kiyoshimo to be remodelled and fully modernized and then tey are ready for the quest together with Ashigara, Ooyodo, and Kasumi (as flagship). With the help of Fusou, they wiped out the entire enemy Boss node with ease. Admiral out."''

|''"The W4-5 is very hard for me, but I didn't expect performace shown by Musashi's absolute firepower. Although Akagi and Kaga didn't show much damage to enemy ships, but they repel most enemy fighters/bombers with help of the AACI master Maya. They made a clean battle and finished the quest. Admiral out."''

|''"This is one of the annoying quest for me, with Ta-class and Destroyer-hime present at boss node. I decided to sacriifice Mizuho pre-emptive torp ability with damecon because I can't risk her to be sunk. I made some mistakes for their equipment setup. Nonetheless they are victorious on this quest. Admiral out."''

|'''B85'''
|[[File:QuestB85.png|thumb|100px]]
|''"Honestly, the only thing I struggle to this quest is the LOS requirement (F33) to reach boss node. This burden is taken by Kuma and Uranami. Thanks to yuri sisters, clearing the boss node become easy. After this quest I feel sorry but to let Kuma go. I hope we cross our paths again. Admiral out."''

|''"One of the hard quests as it involves sortieing W5-5, and Arashio was assigned to this task. They highly recommended the help of support expedition and enough air power to stop enemies' double attacks. High firepower is a must. Luckily no double Re-class battleships found on the Boss node. Admiral out."''

|''"W6-1 is the map I don't want the most. Sortieing the subs are good but the spread of the attack didn't cast upon boss battle. Ooyodo, Taigei and Shion got taiha'd, unluckily didn't sunk the enemy flagship but delivered a strategic victory after the results. Take care of your mother Taigei my fellow subs. Admiral out."''

''"No matter how hard is this quest , Musashi and the Cranes will take care of it. This quest has 3 deployments: W3-5, W4-4, and W6-2. The first map is very easy, all enemies are defeated on every node even Hoppou-chan didn't survive. The second map is one of most annoying maps possesed by compass-chan, the stupid troll sub at boss node, so I ask them to do diamond formation to eliminate the sub. The third map forced me to replace Shoukaku with Kiso due to the branching rules. The enemies are very tough to kill but this isn't a problem for Musashi. Good job everyone and stay strong. Admiral out."''

|''"This is a very easy on first part of quest for Suzuya as equipped with devastating night planes although its potential was not shown as night battle didn't occur. Nothing to say with her companions as they full punch away through the Boss node. The second part of the quest is little bit more challenging since the fleet has taken the north route which compose of stronger enemy ship plus one air raid. As they can maintain air superiority and good performance of LBAS planes, this should be easy as hell. Admiral out."''

As expected to the Big 7 sisters, they just penetrate enemy armor with their 41cm gun and a Type 1 shell. With the help of the Cranes, Maya, Naka-chan, and other participants, victory on both maps is secured. Admiral out."''

|''"It took me eighteen sorties to finish the W5-5 quest as I recalculate the strategies everytime I lost the battle. This is heavily depends on both normal and boss support expedition and the enemy fleet patterns which might give some little advantage of it. The last battle was hopeless to me since I got air parity on boss node but Green-T compensates it. Luckily, the surviving bombers give their best shot to clear the whoile enemy fleet until their last breath, peace to the fallen, fairies. The W6-2 quest is very easy as long as I've maintain the LOS between 40 to 43. They even eliminate the boss fleet unscathed. Admiral out."''

|''"This is the final quest for Saratoga in her Mk.II form to eliminate the entire abyssal combined fleet, and I personally chose Musashi, Zuikaku, Maya, Suzutsuki, and Kitakami to sortie with her. Their survivability until they reach Boss node heavily depends on AACIs and remaining aircrafts. After the LBAS bombing phase, I'm impressed they achieve Air Supremacy giving them the upper hand to defeat them and win the battle."''

|''"I chose Mizuho, Abubear, and Junyou as main components of the quest with the help of the Cranes and Maya. I trade Mizuho's Kouhyouteki with repair team because I can't risk her to be taiha'd. Although there is no 2nd shelling phase due to no battleship in the fleet is present, I decided to put more air power to dominate all nodes on the map and results to a great success, twice.

The first phase (W5-1) was fairly easy which enemy battleships are the real threat on this map but thanks to the crane sisters helping to eliminate destroyers and cruisers and they clear out the rest. The second phase (W5-3) was an intense night battle nodes which they need high evasion sacrificing their firepower. Luckily there is no troll sub at the Boss node.

The first phase (W1-6) has only 3 steps; destroy subs/carriers, survive air defense, and reach goal which they didn't take a sweat to finish it. The second phase was pure luck especially on the yasen node thanks to Shigure's star shell, cleared the boss node only her getting chuuha'd. On the third phase (W3-5), I set Shioi as flagship to lure out Hoppo-chan and the burger-like minions to be attacked while her team would use this opportunity to destroy the enemy fleet. Unfornately, it is my decision to discontinue to eliminate all enemies at boss node because of Ooyodo getting taiha'd but returned a strategic victory after all. The final phase(4-5) was a decisive victory for me, although unable to sink the Harbor-hime and Ru-class Flagship Kai. Job well done, Admiral out."''

|''"This is quest given to the battleship-carrier Ise as flagship. First phase (W3-5) was easy, I have nothing to say about that. The second one (W4-5) was even more easy than the first one as they become the '''fast+ '''fleet that took the shortest route and easily defeated the Boss node without penalties applied. The third one (W6-4) is tricky, as it heavily depends on the LBAS which luckily destroys one Artillery Imp, one light cruiser, and the Supply Depot Princess. They eliminated the Boss at night battle with Kasumi dealing Landing Craft critical damage. Admiral out."''

I didn't include W2-3 and W4-1 because they are too easy to handle them. W5-5 at Boss node are very easy for Musashi, Zuikaku (feel sorry for your sister Shoukaku that I didn't include her) and Saratoga equipped with strong equipments in my arnesal and an addition of torpedo bulges for high defensive purposes. With help of support expedition, they easily reach Boss node with scratch damages, except for Shiratsuyu and Shigure (both chuuha'd) as usual. W6-5 heavily depends on Maya and the survivability of fighters and bombers until they reach the Boss node. I would say the LBAS didn't do much damage as only few enemy ships were destroyed. Anyways, Shigure's TCI deal heavy damage to Aircraft Carrier Princess to chuuha and Musashi finished her. Admiral out."''
