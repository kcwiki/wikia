"This is your user page. Please edit this page to tell the community about yourself!"

And I don't know what I want to tell about my self for community lol.

Atleast I can silently contribute to this wikia.

Btw, Can you tell me how to simplified the link into e.g "Samidare" instead the full link?

EDIT: nvm, somehow it turn to be simplified like usual.

==My favorite pages==

* [[Samidare]]
* [[Samidare]]
* [[Samidare]] lol
