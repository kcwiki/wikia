=== Light Cruiser (CL) ===
'''Note:'''
* In addition to what destroyers can equip, light cruisers can also equip medium caliber guns, large radar, and recon seaplane.
* Light Cruisers can increase their range by equipping Main Gun or Secondary Gun with Range Medium, if their range is Short.
* Fundamentally a strengthened destroyer, please refer to the destroyer section as well.
* {{ShipLink|Yuubari}}, {{ShipLink|Ooyodo}}, {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Kinu/Kai Ni}} and {{ShipLink|Isuzu Kai Ni}} have special properties.
* Take note that ships with no plane slots can not utilize [[Artillery Spotting]].
* Take note that some guns give [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|fit bonuses]] for CL.

'''Points for equipment selection:'''
* Can you utilize artillery spotting?
* Do you want a Double Attack or a Cut In during day?
* Do you need a Double Attack or a Cut In setup for night?
* Do you need a dedicated light cruiser for (O)ASW duties?
* Is an Anti-Air Cut-In necessary?
* Are you fighting against an installation?
* Are you using {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}}?
* Are you using {{ShipLink|Kinu Kai/Ni}}?
* Are you using {{ShipLink|Ooyodo/Kai}} or {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai}}?

====Standard Setup====
* {{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun x2 + {{Seaplane}}Recon Seaplane '''OR''' Wildcard
* Standard setup for light cruisers which enables Artillery Spotting.
** A seaplane is mandatory for artillery spotting.
* Allows for double attacks during day and night, great damage can be expected at night.
* Requires getting [[Aerial Combat|air superiority]].
** In case you cannot utilize Artillery Spotting or you want to use the 3rd slot for something else, feel free to use the 3rd slot as a wildcard. The wildcard can be anything except a {{RedGunMedium}}, {{GreenGunDP}}, {{YellowGun}} or {{TorpedoWeapon}}.


====Night Double Attack (No AS)====
* {{TorpedoWeapon}} + {{YellowGun}} '''OR''' {{GreenGunDP}} [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Secondary_Guns_by_stats Secondary Guns] x2
* Make sure it's a '''Secondary Gun''' and not a '''Main Gun''', as {{GreenGunDP}}Small Caliber Guns are treated as '''Main Guns''', while {{GreenGunDP}}Medium Caliber Guns are treated as '''Secondary Guns'''.
* Mainly used when [[Artillery Spotting]] is not possible.
* Maximizes firepower while maintaining double attack.
* This setup is not recommended if you only have access to {{YellowGun}}[[15.2cm Single Gun Mount]], because of the terrible stats. You are better off using the standard setup instead.


====Night Cut In====
* 2x {{TorpedoWeapon}} + Wildcard; 3x {{TorpedoWeapon}}
* Setup for strong torpedo cut-in attack at night (150%*2)
* As no CL has a high base {{Luck}} to efficiently utilize Cut In attacks, this setup is mostly reserved for ships that have their luck increased through modernization.
* Because such attacks have a {{Luck}} factor and are mostly inconsistent, unlike the Double Attack, you are not recommended to use this setup unless you are facing high armor targets.
** This applies to high luck light cruisers as well. If a Double Attack is capable of defeating your enemies, then you have no reason to use a Cut In either.
* You can improve your Cut In trigger rate with night battle gear like {{Searchlight}}[[Searchlight]] or {{StarShell}}[[Star Shell]]. Flagships also have a higher trigger chance.
* Any other [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Night_Battle_Special_Attacks Cut In] setups are inferior to the Torpedo Cut In and are not recommended.


====Anti-Submarine====
*{{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] x2 + {{DepthCharge}}[[Depth Charge]] '''OR''' {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] '''OR''' Wildcard
* Setup for light cruisers hunting submarines.
* Ships can perform pre-emptive OASW attacks on submarines if they have at least 100 {{ASW}} '''AND''' they have at least a {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] equipped.
** Exception is {{ShipLink|Isuzu/Kai Ni}}, she can always perform OASW attacks regardless.
* There is a synergy effect when equipping at least a {{Sonar}} '''AND''' {{DepthCharge}}, which improves ASW damage by 15%
** Note that while synergy effect is important, being able to perform OASW is even more important. If you can only perform OASW by equipping 3x {{Sonar}}, simply do that.
* Useful for maps in World 4 and World 5. Especially useful in [[1-5]].
* As some maps have boss nodes which contains an enemy submarine, an OASW is especially useful to be able to efficiently eliminate it. This is especially important as some quests demands that you clear such boss nodes with a S rank.
* You can utilize the 3rd slot as a '''Wildcard''' if the light cruiser can reach OASW requirements with only 2 ASW equipment. This allow the destroyer to have an utility role aside from carrying out ASW duties.
** As ASW damage is heavily reliant on equipment, be careful that your damage output doesn't suffer too much by using your 3rd slot as a '''Wildcard'''.

====Anti-Installation Setup====
*{{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Kouhyouteki]] '''OR''' {{GreenGunMG}}{{Tooltip|CD|Concentrated Deployment}} + Wildcard + {{LandingCraft}}
*{{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun x2 '''OR'''{{YellowGun}}Secondary Gun x2 + {{LandingCraft}}
* Allows {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}} or {{ShipLink|Kinu/Kai Ni}} to have an anti-installation role.
* In case you want to use a {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Kouhyouteki]] or a {{GreenGunMG}}{{Tooltip|CD|Concentrated Deployment}}, it is not possible to give them a double attack setup.
** Guns qualified for Concentrated Deployment are {{GreenGunMG}}[[25mm Triple Autocannon Mount (Concentrated Deployment)|25mm CD]], {{GreenGunMG}}[[Bofors 40mm Quadruple Autocannon Mount|Bofors]] and {{GreenGunMG}}[[QF 2-pounder Octuple Pom-pom Gun Mount|Pom-pom]] guns.


====4 Slot CL====
* {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai}} and {{ShipLink|Ooyodo/Kai}} both have 4 equipment slots, unlike the other CLs.
* {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai}} has '''no''' plane slots. While it's still possible for her to equip seaplanes and gain stats and {{LoS}}, she cannot perform [[Artillery Spotting]] in any circumstances.
* Ooyodo has terrible base {{ASW}} stats, which makes it harder for her to reach OASW requirements, unlike {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai|text=Yuubari}}.
* Ooyodo has low {{Torpedo}} stats, but has better {{HP}} and {{Armor}}, which makes her excellent for Anti-Installation purposes.


=====4 Slot Anti-Submarine=====
*{{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] 3x + {{DepthCharge}}[[Depth Charge]] '''OR''' {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]]
* The same rules applies to the 4 slots light cruisers, the only difference is that you now have another equipment slot available.
* You only receive the synergy bonus once. Equipping 2x {{Sonar}} and 2x {{DepthCharge}} will not do anything extra.
* Because of how poor the base {{ASW}} stats is of Ooyodo, Yuubari is better suited for this role.


=====4 Slot Anti-Installation=====
*{{RedGunMedium}} Main x2 + {{WG42}}[[WG42]] x2
* A setup focused on destroying installations who are weak to [[WG42]] during night battle.
* As {{ShipLink|Ooyodo/Kai}} has better survivability, she is recommended for this role.


====CLT Abukuma====
* {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}} is unique in the way that she functions exactly like a CLT, while being classified as a CL.
* Check the CLT section for more information regarding {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}}
