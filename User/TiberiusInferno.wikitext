Hello! You've visited my profile! I don't know why, but welcome. Here are some quick facts to help you know myself. 

=== When Did I Start Playing Kancolle? ===
September of 2015. I can't remember the actual date, but it's around the 17th.

=== Why Did I Start? ===
I honestly don't have a clue. I heard about this odd game about World War II ships, but they weren't actual ships, they were girls. Now, being me, somebody who has been watching anime and becoming more and more interested in Japan, I thought to myself "Well, it can't be ''that ''bad, right?". Well, here I am now, still playing the game, and having a good amount of fun doing so.

=== Events ===
Fall 2015 - to E4 

Winter 2016 - Cleared (H -> N -> N)

Some more random facts
* Inazuma was my starter
* I'm located on the Hashrajima Anchorage server
* Fall 2015 was my first event
* Winter 2016 was the first event I completed fully (I know, I know, it was only three maps) 

I make small edits, and nothing to do with API or script. Grammar police stuff.
