so the game just simply froze up whenever i try to change the ship equipment, and change the fleet preset. the other things such as sortie, taking up quest etc are fine. i'm using chrome with KCCkai but there no problem before. so does anyone know how to fix it? cause seriously i need to use mozilla to play it now, which is a pain cause KCCkai so handy.

-much obliged.<ac_metadata title="Game froze up whenever i try to change equipment etc."> </ac_metadata>
