<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">So I was fighting submarines in 1-5 to test my carriers because they seem to eat bauxites even when their planes arent't lost. And to my surprise, after the battle, my total fighters count decreses by 2 (check with KC3). Now I was sure that subs cannot attack planes, especially fighters, which should have nothing to do with subs... So why is that happening? Can anyone answer?</span><ac_metadata title="About planes and carriers"> </ac_metadata>
