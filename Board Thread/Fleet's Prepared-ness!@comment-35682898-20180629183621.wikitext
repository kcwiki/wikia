Hi, I'm pretty new to the game and would like some advice on what I should focus on to prepare for the summer event. I'm thinking of going after casual/easy difficulties for now because I don't really think my fleet would be ready. Can you guys help me out and tell me what I should be focusing on?

Thanks :D
