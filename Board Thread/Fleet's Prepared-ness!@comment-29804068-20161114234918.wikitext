So, I've been preparing myself since summer and the event let me pretty bad on resources, but now I sort of recovered from it.

I was planning on doing the first maps on medium since i think my girls can do it, but i don't think my resources and equipment are going to let me do it ;w;

[[File:Kancolle_list.png|thumb|left]][[File:Kancolle_equipment.png|thumb]]My resources are Fuel 41k, ammo 39k (and still going up), steel 38k and bauxite 26k. An currently i have 205 buckets

I'm still trying to level Hiryuu, Souryuu, Kawakaze, Haruna and Maya by doing daily pvp ( It has work so far )<ac_metadata title="Help, preparing for Fall event"> </ac_metadata>
