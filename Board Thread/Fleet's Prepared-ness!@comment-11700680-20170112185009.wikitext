I managed to get to the boss node of E-5 during Fall 2016 on easy, and failed because I had to craft a load of planes mid E-5. So, after a load of leveling and crafting, am I ready for hard?Â

If i'm not ready, are there any ships i should level or equipment i should craft? I could probably level at most 3-5 more ships to a high level before I would need to start stockpiling resources.<ac_metadata title="Am I ready for hard?"> </ac_metadata>
