Good day fellow Admiral.

With each day passing Fall 2016 is getting closer and closer and like in every good exam now is a good time to start panicking (only panicking, studying and working on it is for 1 day before the event).

Aiming for medium difficulty what should I do now?

I know that I'm a bit low on good DD. Asashio/Hibiki and Satsuki are planned for leveling.

On resources I'm not really ok, 57/53/41/25K, need to raise these resources.[[File:DD1.jpg|thumb|DD(1st part)]][[File:DD2.jpg|thumb|DD 2nd part]][[File:ListBB.jpg|thumb|BB/FBB/BBV]][[File:CLt.jpg|thumb|CL and CLT]][[File:CVl.jpg|thumb|CV/CVL]][[File:Othership.jpg|thumb|Other, SS/AO/AR/AV]][[File:CAv.jpg|thumb|CA/CAV list]]

Ps: Have only 3 unique sub and no CT so no expedition after 29 and 33.

Thanks in advance for your help.Â 

Edit: CA/CAV list added. Strange I was sure i already uploaded it first..[[File:LevelingFall2016.jpg|thumb|Current goal (to kai ni or level 60)]]<ac_metadata title="Well, now it&#039;s a good time to panic"> </ac_metadata>
