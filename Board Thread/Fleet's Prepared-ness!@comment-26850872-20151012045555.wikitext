Hello everyone. I'm currently recouping my resources since I'm down to less than 8k per resources and less than a hundred buckets all thanks to me going quite all-out on fishing, and I'm up to 26 fishes right now, 4 more to go and I can return to event prep mode. That is provided I can at least get 1~2 fish per day, yep. Barring other life business, that is.

My HQ is currently at level 98 but no one in my fleet is of above level 90 yet. Closest to that is [[Haruna]] at level 89 which she just reached this morning (as of time of writing) via daily PVP.

For a basic run-down of what I have (please excuse the length caused by the line of screenshots)...

<u>'''Ships:'''</u>

<u>'''Equipment:'''</u> (Note: Some of them have been improved via Akashi but I'm not going to put them all down here, for the sake of brevity, those are mainly main guns and [[Type 91 Armor-Piercing (AP) Shell|Type 91 AP]] shells. Same goes with planes, I have a number of them at chevrons)

<u>'''Some considerations that I could have done since last Summer 2015 event'''</u> (but didn't happen for whatever reason)


→ Some light cruisers could use a little bit more levels. Like [[Abukuma]], [[Jintsuu]], [[Nagara]] and [[Kuma]] . However the Kuma and Nagara I got wasn't my first ones, I got them back after realizing they are among the best non-Kai 2 CLs. [[Naka]] is sitting somewhere in the middle for a standard CL, [[Ooyodo]]'s four slots are offset by her weak torpedo stat making night battles hard for her, but not impossible (she might as well be holding all the night battle gear I need like the Star Shells and the Type 98 Night Scout).


→ Same goes to CAs. In fact they have a lot of Kai 2 I could have gotten them to bar [[Chikuma]] probably. [[Myoukou]] especially, after seeing how many Admirals aced the last event (Summer 2015) with her in the fleet. Yes, I do know of that one gif.


→ DDs, just, DDs. There's a very large gap between some groups of destroyers, but I'm having them pick the pace up albeit at a very slow pace. So far I only have two Kai 2 destroyers with the rest trailing at least 30 levels behind, especially for those who a Kai 2 would be most appropriate for them. Having to always send these two and nothing else for the later map clearings are going to make it very, very difficult, isn't it?


→ It would be paramount if I can rush both [[Souryuu]] and [[Hiryuu]] into their Kai 2s... but I got Hiryuu just recently and powerleveling them both would mean a hit to my already tiny current resources pool.


→ It would be nice if I can have better radars, or, have the ones I currently have improved for at least even a tiny bit.

→ If Hayasui is needed for branching, might consider myself screwed if I don't level her some more I guess. orz

<u>'''Event Goals'''</u>

'''→ Path of Least Time, Resource and Sanity Spent (tm)'''

→ Eye for better rewards where I could

→ Finish the event regardless of difficulty chosen (Last Summer ended me at '''61/1850 HP''' against [[Air Defense Princess]] and I ran out of resources to finish her off, oh I will never forget this).

<u>'''Random musings'''</u>

→ RNG-sama, I need more [[Ryuusei]]s at the very least... I don't know if my squadron of normal [[Tenzan]]s can carry me all the way to the end.

→ After all the plane crafting and sorties with them, I'd call out Akagi's bluff if she says she doesn't know what a [[Reppuu]] is. Unless if she ate them where I'll have to deal with that personally.

→ I still want a [[Nagato]] ;_;

... Though having these all said, one can never be too prepared I guess. One look at the actual event map later will tell where I stand in all that. Last but not least: the motto, ''"GET CHANCE AND LUCK!"'' needs to be said.

Oh, and one last word, quoting someone (not my words): '''A good Abyssal is a sunk Abyssal.'''<ac_metadata title="Fall Event 2015 Prep - Just where am I?"> </ac_metadata>
