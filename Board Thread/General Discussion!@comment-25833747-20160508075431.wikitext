Since I have an trouble with my resource recently and use very long time to regain resources. But I have too much steel when the rest of them nearly empty.

So I thing some idea from my previous browser game I play for long time ago, Travian. They have resource exchange market feature but it interact with players. Then if it can improvise to use as main feature in the game with exchange ratio or use funiture coins as price for exchange resource such as exchange 1 fuel for every 10 steels or use 10000 coins for 5000 ammos etc. I need this feature into this game in future update. Because expedition is take so much time (officialy: time consuming) and outcome is pretty low as well for me.

I need to suggest this idea to their developers. But sadly, I cannot speak or write Japanese to send some idea to developers. This idea should be a great idea for resource management in this game in the future.Â 

Feel free to discuss in here about my idea. Thank you.<ac_metadata title="Exchange resource feature - Is it good to be available on Kancolle?"> </ac_metadata>
