Since the difficulty setting has been introduced. I haven't yet finished them though with hard mode.

In winter event I only clear E-4 on easy because of all of my carriers along with their air groups( my reppu kai D: ) and battleships got scrap then start with no resource. While in summer I clear all stage expect E-5 on hard but finished on easy because the fleet is lacking in firepower and AA defensive.

Well, lets see:
