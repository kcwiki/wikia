I recently aquired Akashi, and have no idea what equipment is even worth upgrading. She currently sits at level 3, and I won't be leveling her untill after the event. So, what equipment (equipment list:Â http://imgur.com/L2T3GsY) should I prioritise upgrading and should I wait untill Akashi is Kai or a higher level then she is now before I start upgrading equipment? I have 67 screws at the time of posting this.<ac_metadata title="Equipment modernization."> </ac_metadata>
