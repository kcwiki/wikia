Hi im wondering if i should go for easy or medium for the upcoming event. I started in the middle of summer event, so was kinda sad i wasnt able to participate in in. I feel my fleet is kinda unbalanced but not really sure where to improve them. Also i play casually.. Kinda like only on weekends most of the time. So with the current time limitation i have, im unsure where to improve on. Current resources 28k/29k/30k/15k. Much appreciated in advance :D
