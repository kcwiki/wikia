[[File:Echo_Graf.jpg|thumb|312px|Maybe one day I'll color it properly]]BRACE YOURSELF, WINTER IS COMING.

Winter Event just got announced, and Graf is a returnee for a second chance for those who failed last event!
So stock up, prepare properly, and in the meantime, '''DRAW ME EVERYONE'S FAVORITE COFFEE GIRL.'''

Chat is down, there's nothing you can do but draw! '''SO DO IT.'''

Even if you have little drawing skill, just draw something!

'''I'LL BE FIRST FOR ONCE.'''

FALUKORVS WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED.
