Senpai,




I'm farming at 3-2A using SS tanker with current condition now:

HQ 30

FBB : All Kongou sisters around level 27-30, Ise level 21

CV : Kaga n Akagi level 30

CL : Sendai n Jitsuu level 22

CLT : Kitakami level 20

CVL : Shouhou level 28

BBV : Fusou & Yamashiro level 24

DD : Fubuki, Hibiki, Yuudachi, n Ayanami around 20-24

CA : Maya level 20

SS : I-8 n I-168 level 12

That's all kanmusu i've kai-ed (except SS n Ise).

I'm still not continuing my world map

World 1 up to 1-5 (EO 1-6 not done yet, should i?)

World 2 up to 2-4 (EO 2-5 not done yet)

World 3 up to 3-2 (on preparation)

World 4-1 up to 4-1



So, I'm gladly if you can help me on:

1. How much i grind level at 3-2A? before start clearing the world map again.

2. If there's any lacking in myship composition right now (for example, which ship type i am still lacking to clear certain map ahead).

and

3. i always in lack of steel, i saw someone do 4-2 for steel farming with solo SS, but that's in high level. i've seen somewhere that before 3-2 is also the best map to do steel farming (refresh browser) but we can't do it anymore (CMIIW). do we have another steel farming trick beside grinding on expedition 3?



Sorry too much question, i just start playing this game last week.

Thanks<ac_metadata title="Which one should i do first? Grinding Level at 3-2A or Clear the main map?"> </ac_metadata>
