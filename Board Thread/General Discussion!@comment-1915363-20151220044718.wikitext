Since I'll be live streaming my marriage with Italia and Roma soon, I might as well open an invite thread so everyone can look up their marriage invites in one place.

For those who wish to post their marriage invite here, it is recommended to include the following information:
* Date and time of marriage. (countdown timer didn't work here, sadly)
* A link to your live stream (for live streamers)
* Marriage record picture or video if applicable
* An outline for the marriage process (unless if it's simply a ring-and-go ceremony)
* A dedicated marriage invite thread for live-streamers. Because, well, a single invite might invite quite a handful of comments.

Try to keep the comments to a minimum here. Comments for a marriage invite should go their dedicated threads. <ac_metadata title="[Invite] Post your Kanmusu Marriage Invites Here."> </ac_metadata>
