Hi, I started playing a few weeks ago and am now HQ level 25 with my main fleet being around level 20 to 30. I heard there is a major event coming up in the summer that people are stockpiling resources for, so I am wondering if I should be concentrating on building up my forces versus hoarding resources. About what level for ships and HQ should I begin preparing for the events?Â
