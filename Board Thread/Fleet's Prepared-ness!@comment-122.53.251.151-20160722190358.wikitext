Hi everyone, this is my first time posting my fleet here. Is it possible to handle a full run in medium or medium/hard mix with my current composition/resources? Right now I'm leveling the akizuki class so I have more AA ships. I'm also levelling other ships to be >60 to counter ship-locking. I'm not that familiar with equipments, so to me it's not clear if my equipment can handle it. Please help and thanks in advance
