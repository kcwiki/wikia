I was browsing and happened to notice that the kagerou calss is typed kagero in the title.Â http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Kagero_Class?display=exhibition&sort=mostvisited

It's missing the u at the end but I can't change it with the edit option so if someone can go in and change it that would be nice.<ac_metadata title="Kagerou Class title typo"> </ac_metadata>
