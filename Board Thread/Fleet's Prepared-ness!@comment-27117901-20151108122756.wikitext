10 days to the Fall '15 Event .

I'm not even sure if my fleet can make it through the Fall (after rekt'd hard in Summer '15)

Here's my Fleet and Equipment:



The question(s):
[[File:Ww1_(3).png|thumb]][[File:Ww1_(4).png|thumb]][[File:Ww1_(5).png|thumb]]

1) Should I attempt mixed Izi-Medium? (or some Hard, with the diff for last map will be decided after the rewards revealed)

2) Should I Kai Ni both Akatsuki and Hibiki? or switch their place with Ayanami and Murakumo/Hatsuharu? or give Ushio the K2? (given 10 days left, and im kinda busy with real life matters)

3) During Last Dance Summer E7, i was desperate to clear E7 asap (cuz of real life matters) and someone advice me to improveÂ  the Quad Oxy to 3* (I did cleared E7 after doing the improvement, just RNG being RNG). thus, should I continue the improvement to max and upgrade them to Quint?

4) Its worth to upgrade some of the 20.3 cms to (no.2) and to (no.3) onwards?

5) BP choice, have one here. should I..

give it to Bismarck? or..

give the BP to Abukuma? or..

give the BP to either Zuikaku or Shoukaku (i did have 2 catapults atm)



btw, now im doing the new plane + 3rd catapult quest + leveling (working on DDs and CVLs, and Shou/Zui too).<ac_metadata title="Fall Event: The Chances (mixed diff)"> </ac_metadata>
