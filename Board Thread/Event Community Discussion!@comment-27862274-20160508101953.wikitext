<span style="font-weight:normal;">This is a question for E-6 and E-7 of spring 2016's event. Currently i've heard that runs using airfield support and cvs will drain bauxite by at most 1000 per run, so im pretty worried that i can't clear these maps due to a lack of resources. Im a level 88 ttk, and my bauxite sits at 23411 (with 22750 cap), so pretty scared right now ;-; My planes are pretty good, have 3 Susei 12A, 2 Ryuusei Kai, 7 Reppuu, 8 Shiden Kai and 7 Saiun, with the plane reward from E2 Easy (will have reward from E4 soon).</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">My other resources are performing badly as well, primarily due to E2's Easy final dance where RNG screwed me hard leaving me with a loss of 18000 fuel/ammo and 70 buckets. I had the right composition and equipment as well as level 70 ships, including Abukuma Kai Ni and 4 Daihatsu along with Amphibious as well. Very salty indeed, leaving a big hit on my resource count at 11047 fuel and 10824 ammo.</span>

In terms of where im at, i am on E4, but it should be a breeze, as my ships are pretty high level, with around 19 ships above level 60 and 12 ships past 70. My future plans are to finish each event map (on easy) in less than 2 days, then hardcore regen my resources until it reaches my cap of 22750 (takes around 1-2 days). After i (hopefully) finish the event within 1-2 weeks, i should have some time to farm ships at E2 for AACI destroyers (5 days?). Just want to ask if this seems like a good plan.

Expeditions im using are: 2, 5, 21, 37, 38 (5, 21, 37 and 38 are usually sparkled along with 4 daihatsu)

And yes, i do realise my resources are horrid ;_____;Â
