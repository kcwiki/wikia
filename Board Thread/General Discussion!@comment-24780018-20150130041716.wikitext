So I am a little worried. I am about 140k EXP before I hit HQ 100 and I don't know if I am prepared for the upcoming event (Ship wise)



What level would you say my ships be for a HQ 100 Event. I know that potentially this Event might be easier due to the bandwagoners from the Anime, can't be too harsh on all the newcomers. But ya, thanks in advance!<ac_metadata title="Hitting HQ 100 before the Event"> </ac_metadata>
