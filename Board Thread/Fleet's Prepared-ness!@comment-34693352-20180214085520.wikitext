It has been a year ever since I started Kancolle. Now I am a Teitoku for&nbsp;a year I want to see how I improve (or not improved) from last year.

I did not clear the event last year, though I made it far to at least E-3 when the game kinda locked me out of progression due to lacking SSVs for transport phase. So this year I will try to make a comeback and pay them back.

==================================================
[[File:Aru'sResources.png|thumb]]Anyways back to the topic at hand:

-I have this sudden feeling of dread that I might still be lacking in ship types. I want to know if I need more of a particular ship type. I will replace any of my PVP Set-up group to other ships that are really important for the event.

(Current PVP Set-up: Akitsumaru, Murasame, Chikuma, Yura, Asagumo, Kashima)

-Equipment Wise there are other equipments there I am missing out due to quest (I havent paid much attention to one-time quests) so I am behind in those. What would be some quest that I would grab, and can I get it before or during the event without expending a ton of resources just to get it.

-Resources, I do feel like I need more Fuel and Ammo. What do you guys think? My current Expeditions are 2 - 6 - 37. (Gaining Ammo, Bauxite, and Bucket.) Should I change the expeditions or keep going with what I have.

-Goal: To Prioritize Beating Spring 2018 Normal Mode. If the goal is too hard to do it in Normal, I will do some portions of the event Easy.

-Sub Goal: Getting Warspite (If she comes out) when I am done beating the event.
==================================================

Misc:
I have enough medals for 1 Blueprint, My plan was to get Musashi Kai Ni. Would that be good choice or save it for other ships and wait out the Musashi Remodel for next month.

I think that is about it for me here in this post. Sorry for my terrible english, it is not my first language. I hope to be able to beat the event. Lastly, advance thanks to people who took their time in reading this, and giving advices / tips / help, would really helped me a ton.&nbsp; <ac_metadata title="[Normal] Spring Event Revenge?"> </ac_metadata>
