I've been playing KanColle for only about two months now, so my ship and equipment selection is still quite small. I wonder whether I should even participate in the summer event.

If you think I should, please give me some advise on what I should focus on until then. My ressources are currently only 11493 / 18822 / 8231 / 12967.
Thanks in advance, fellow TTK!<ac_metadata title="New TTK doesn&#039;t know whether to participate in upcoming event"> </ac_metadata>
