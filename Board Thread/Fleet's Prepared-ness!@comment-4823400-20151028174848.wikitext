[[File:光冠-Showcase.png|thumb|KC3Kai Showcase]]Wondering how ready I am for this next event, last Summer was my first event, caught me on my first week, I could only finish until E-5, all Easy, before proceeding to just grind for submarines, so at least I have something to show for it.

Been doing some grinding, total of 19 (unique) K2 so far, with Fubuki up-and-coming for the 20th

Notable (I think) shipgirls that doesn't show up in the showcase are Yukikaze and Shimakaze Kai, both at full modernization except luck though still at late 30s, Abukuma still around lv 30, though I think I can grind her to Kai-ni level in a week. Zuikaku and Hiryuu still leveling in preparation for Kai-ni (much anticipated for Zuikaku), though as can be seen, my CA are kind of lackluster, I find it difficult leveling them reliably.

My resources hover around 20k, except bauxite, which seem stuck just around 10k, and around 240 buckets

Anything I still need to prepare? Specific girl to grind? November I should be able to manage another Blueprint if so needed, Kai-ni recommendations? my HQ level is currently 98, what difficulty should I tackle this event? All Medium? Perhaps some Hard here and there? or stick to Medium-Easy?<ac_metadata title="Fleet&#039;s Readiness for its Second Event"> </ac_metadata>
