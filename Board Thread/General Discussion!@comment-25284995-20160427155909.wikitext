The 11th March 2016 Game update: The day when the devs introduced a new map for this game, many people have tasted the salt of land-based attacking.

Some TTKs think this is the new era of a doom (since the Air Defense Hime, aka. Kitanda, had come here) and trying to avoid it at all cost. Because it's still useless to complete the ending map in the game, at least for now.

But another TTKs rather think in differently way, they found this map is a good challenge for their fate (or you may likely want to call it RNG) or their preparedness for the upcoming Spring Event of this year.

Then, how about yours?...

Your progression on 6-4 map?
I rekted it!!! (5/5: All cleared.)
I nearly rekted it now! (4/5: LAST DANCE SUFFERING)
I just got it in a half way. (3/5: Just another hundred of buckets for this map...)
Three times left for killing the boss?, WTF why my buckets were sinking so fast. (2/5: Like this? I'm done. See you again next year.)
WOW, this map is so Kitanda. Poor landing fairies... (1/5: Beachhead Kancolle)
It rekted me... (0/5: SALT)
I even haven't cleared 6-1, 6-2 or 6-3 map yet so don't talk to me.
I don't fuking know this map.
