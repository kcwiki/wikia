I'm really wondering what ships we'll get in this upcoming event. I hope the final 2 Mutsuki's, or the final 6 Kagerou's might be available. If that doesn't happen, then maybe the 3 Katori class light cruisers or Seaplane Tenders Nisshin and Mizuho will be here too. Comment on what you think will be in the event.<ac_metadata title="New Ships fo Fall 2014 Event" related_topics="Fall 2014 Event"> </ac_metadata>
