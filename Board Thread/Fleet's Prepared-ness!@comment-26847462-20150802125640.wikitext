Actully I want to clear Hard level this time but recent news about the event like ship locking, 7 stages, a lot of CV needed had scared me so hard. So..., I want to know can I still make it to E-7? (One of my TTK friends said lvl.60+ ships were enough for hard level last time but I think he just had insane amount of luck.)

Here is my fleet info:
