Hello, folks! Being too lazy to follow those terrifying steps just to get an API link, I've recently made a Windows app that does it in a few seconds using credentials (DMM's ID or Email and Password) provided by a user. App can also play the game directly on the desktop without the use of a web-browser, though those who are good with web-browser can use it just to obtain an API link. It saves user's credentials and API link so that the next time you run the app there is no need to log in again, you can just start the game immediately. All data is strongly encrypted with the key that is unique for every machine and there is an option to protect the app with a password to prevent anyone on the same PC to see your credentials or play the game from your account. My friend told me to share it here, so, please, tell me what do you guys think about it.

Technical requirements: IE 9 or newer, .NET Framework 4.0.
