I might be paranoid here but what are the chance of getting banned due to refreshing the page while you're sortieing?

So far I've done it three times - first time a while ago during the last event and, second and third time just now on 3-3. I'm trying to farm some coins though most of the time, one or two of my ships get critically demaged at node I which I gambled my fleet hoping they'll reach one of the coin nodes but unfortunately they always end up on boss node. As a result I've refreshed the page just before my fleet hits the boss node.

Am I in the grey area?<ac_metadata title="Chance of getting banned for refreshing?"> </ac_metadata>
