Aiming for all Hard, again. (Last time Eugen drop rate forced me to clear it on Medium) Here's my resources at the moment

82k fuel, 73k ammo, 163k steel, 37k baux, and 510 buckets.

I can find appx 5000 fuel and max 20 buckets a day, including the ones I can get from dailies.Â 

I'm quite confidient in my girl to some degree but I went a bit mental with level grinding lately so stocking up to my ideal point is quite impossible now. Since this is gonna be my first small scale event, I still need some reference.

Thx in advance.<ac_metadata title="Should I panic about my resources now?"> </ac_metadata>
