I've cleared E-1 on Hard using these ==>[[File:E1crew.png|thumb|245px]]



But now I'm facing a dilemma on who to use next on each map. Thanks to 7 maps, 4 shiplocks, 4 combined fleets and complicated branching I still can't decide on how to spread my fleet, even after reading the current information on branching.

My plan for the rest of the event is to clear E-2, E-3 on Normal (to leave it later for farming), E-4, E-5 on Hard, if possible (for rewards and medals), E-6, E-7 on Normal.

These are the ships I prepared for this event and reserves I can use:

Anything below these are either the expedition team (Mutsuki class are next in order) or are not worth mentioning. I also lack some ships needed for branching, like Akitsushima, Tone class CAVs (SuzuKuma are the best I've got) and more higher level CVLs (the next best thing is Shouhou at level 38).

I'm not worrying about E-7 as I can just use the strongest ships from all other maps except E-5. Its the rest that I need to clear to get to E-7 I'm at a loss about. Mainly about BBs, CVs and CVLs and probably CLTs. Perhaps I'll need to replace BBs somewhere with CAs? Use more CVs and get harder branching?

Could someone who already got to E-7 have some suggestions for me?

Thanks in advance

P.S. I almost forgot to mention that I don't have that much time to spend on this event because of work. I can play a total of 8 days including this one. <ac_metadata title="Advice needed" lastmove="1449616092"> </ac_metadata>
