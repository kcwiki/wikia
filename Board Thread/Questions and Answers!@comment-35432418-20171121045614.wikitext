Hey there.

Random generated numbers... But from you guys point of view, should I definitely aim to combine fighters with dive-bombers/bombers and increase my chances to Aicraft cut in or just stack needed bombers?Â 

If yes, it's worth combine, should I do it with all my CVs in fleet, or mix "Cut-ins with one stack of bombers" when sorting with +2 CVs?

Note: Before the Summer event I would really rarely mix dive-bomber-figher, and just make sure to have enough air-superiority and throw all dive bombers.<ac_metadata title="Aircraft Carriers Cut-in a MUST?"> </ac_metadata>
