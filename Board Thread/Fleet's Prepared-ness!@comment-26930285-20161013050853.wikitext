[[File:Dd-shira.jpg|thumb|200px|DD]]Ok, given that i only play Kancolle in my free time between working and university (yeah, i do both simultaneously), i can't even finish the last 3 events in easy. But i'm planning to finish this time on Easy and Medium (if possible). So, is my fleet ready for it?[[File:Cl-shira.jpg|thumb|200px|CL and CT]]

On resources i'm only have 22k on everything (i ran expedition everytime i can but resources mysteriously keep dissapearing ._. ) and 500 buckets.

My current goal is K2 Ashigara, Hiei, Kirishima, RJ, and Jun'you, also to find Akashi (no luck for 2 months).

Thank you, any input is greatly appreciated :)



Note : Misteriously my HQ is 84 already, so i can't level DD and CL in 1-5 anymore T_T[[File:Ca-shira.jpg|thumb|200px|CA and CAV]][[File:Bb-shira.jpg|thumb|200px|BB and FBB]][[File:Cv-shira.jpg|thumb|200px|CVL and CV]][[File:Other-shira.jpg|thumb|200px|Other Ships]][[File:Eq-shira.jpg|thumb|200px|Equipment in Sorry state]]<ac_metadata title="Preparing for my first Medium event"> </ac_metadata>
