I'm seeing some pages in the wiki not loading the comments nor the sidebar and sometimes not even displaying images and just leave a blank space. The navigation bar also don't work on these pages. I dunno if it's on my end since some pages in this wiki seem to work fine. I tried accessing it on another browser but the issue also appeared there.<ac_metadata title="Wiki loading problem"> </ac_metadata>
