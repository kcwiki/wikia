Hello, everyone I have been playing Kancolle for some weeks, currently at HQ lvl 52, and have the 4th fleet unlocked. I have been able to pile up a lot of resources lately, and they have been going past the soft cap ( generally above 14k for all of them) a lot. I have been doing the  the default LSC recipe each three days, and CV/SS recipes, each twice a day (CV/SS hate me though, so never get anything..). Since the resources still pile up I was thinking about trying some "bigger" LSCs. Don't know which recipes they'd be, but am considering the Taihou ones because even if I don't get Taihou herself it seems like I still have a decent chance of getting some other CVs  (only have Akagi right now and REALLY need more of them, but they refuse to drop in maps or regular construction for me) and other cool ships anyways... But still, I'm new of this and not sure if this would be a good idea. What do you guys think ? :S   Thank you very much (and sorry if my english is weird)!!<ac_metadata title="Should I try LSC??"> </ac_metadata>
