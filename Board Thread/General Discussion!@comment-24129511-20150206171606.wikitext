After a stupid mistake involving API link (stop playing almost for year so i forgot so many things). And because sever just open it was lagging. It's too late.

Now I lost all my resource and half of my capital ships. What funny is all of the ships I lost was sunk befor Operation Hailstone. I guess that make it more realistic. Anyway, I'll still take part in this event. To see how far I can get staring with noÂ resource and lvl. 40ish ships. Right now at half gage of E2, normal mode. Well, it won't be long for E2 if my Haruna keep one shot the flag ship on her frist salvo like this (and after saying this she probably wouldn't do it anymore).

Also probably gonna write comic about this later.<ac_metadata title="Right now I&#039;m feeling like a real IJN admiral."> </ac_metadata>
