So, I was trying to collect my ship from the shipyard. While the game was loading I accidentally hit the home button, and I failed to stop it in time. I re-opened the game and not only can't I get the ship, I can't build in my open slot either. Reloading didn't help Does anyone know how to deal with this situation?<ac_metadata title="Broken Construction menu."> </ac_metadata>
