So, I've been playing KC for almost a year now, and I've decided to post up my fleet (or at least the part of my fleet I consider viable for use in the event).  I'd like input on how prepared I am for this upcoming event since the past few events I've struggled occasionally in certain parts of each one.

(I'm using a pseudonym in case anyone is wondering.  For veterans of the wiki, I'm curious if you can guess who I am?)

'''Edit: Sorry about the mess, Jenesis.  I've relinked my ships ordered by class as well as listed my equips for you.  I'd still actually like advice believe it or not as I've never actually done a preparedness check before this and we are still pretty much in the dark for this upcoming event.'''
