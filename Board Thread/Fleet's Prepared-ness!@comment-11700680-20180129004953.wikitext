I'm not good at telling what equipment I should prioritize since there is so much of it to sift through, so what should I scramble to get while I'm stockpiling for the event? I will not grind for equipment from ships and only do the daily development for making equipment. I am doing the sortie weeklies that can be done cheeply, so I am getting a decent number of screws per week. I just need a list of things in order of absolutely must have ready before this event no matter what so I don't waste resources pointlessly.

And yes, I have a lot of small guns. They won't go away.[[File:Equipment_List_2018-01-29.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="What equipment should I be desperate for?"> </ac_metadata>
