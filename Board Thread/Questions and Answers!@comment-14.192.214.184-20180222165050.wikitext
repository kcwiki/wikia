I tried to access the game and i can only send my fleet out for expedition only. When it comes to battle, the whole game froze on the battle loading screen with only the music playing. Basically, I can do everything except battle.Â I tried clearing my cache and everything but the problem persist. Any help would be much appreciated (;_;)<ac_metadata title="[Help] Game won&#039;t load"> </ac_metadata>
