Right now DMM is handing out 500 points for free.
So if you're interested, follow these steps:

1. Access [http://dmmgames-tgs2015.jp/appstore/ this page] with an Android device of your choice.

2. Click on "今すぐアプリをダウンロード！" to download the "DMM Game Store" Android app.<br />Or just download it from [http://www.mediafire.com/download/l4br9sr7jpg2uls/DMMGameStore.apk here] and copy it onto your phone/tablet.

3. Install the app and start it up.

4. Click on the silhouette at the top-right of the screen, between the speech bubble and grid icon.

5. Click on ログイン ("Login"), then log in.

6. With your app log-in registered at DMM, wait until the 5th October. DMM will distribute the points on that day by sending a point code to the email address you've registered to your DMM account.<br />Don't worry if you don't get the email right away, DMM said that it might take some time.<br />The points are valid until the 19th October, 23:59, after which they expire.

Note: I take no responsibility for getting some or all the details wrong, so don't bother shitting on me.
