That... makes me wonder, I've been getting several Agano classes from two previous event, my usual frontliner CL were Yahagi, Ooyodo, Yuubari, Sendai and Isuzu... before I got Agano I've been leveling up my Yura, Tenryuu and Tatsuta whose levels averages at 50 by now...



what do you guys think, should I continue with the three normal CL I've got, or should I start the rest three Agano whose levels are pretty much bellow 30 right now...



ah thanks for the recomendation beforehand~<ac_metadata title="so I heard torpedo squadron is going to be important on next event..."> </ac_metadata>
