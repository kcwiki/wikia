I've actually been playing fairly seriously for around 18~ months, my first event was Winter 2015 when Snake and DJ Hime were introduced. I managed to clear the event and all events following so far in a mix of Easy-Hard, usually finishing the final map on Normal or Easy due to shiplocking. I'm just going to post a imgur link to the fleet dump I just made proir to typing up this message.

For those wondering, I have 250 ship slots and thats most likely not going to increase any time soon cuz real life restrictions.

I literally just remembered (realized?) that SCAMP is from quest B28 and I finally got around to leveling and remodelling my Unryuu to Kai this past week, I'm going to deal with that tomorrow...cuz I'm about to pass out on the keyboard after typing this equipment list....

And one final thanks before I finish this post, I've read a metric shit ton of the pages on this wiki and its been incredibly helpful in getting to where I'm at now, especially in the events, but between playing a few other games and real life picking up recently, hard researching is starting to get harder for me to do. Especially when I'm having to chase my roommate's 2 year old terrorist around the house because she's too busy sleeping on the couch.... (aint my kid damnit!)

EDIT: I forgot to mention, I have 5 Blueprints and 7 Medals sitting there waiting on ships to catch up to being able to use them currently, like Biscuit who I just built a week or two ago, I also have 3 more medals to pick up this month as well so I'll essentially have 7 Blueprints by the end of this month to either use or turn some Medals into Screws for more upgrades. As far as current Screws, I have 83 and was thinking of dropping them on the Jet Keiun over-time to ease screw cost of upgrading.

EDIT2: added thumbnails of my ship and equip lists, commentary was deleted as well as the old imgur album and the giant hand-typed list of equipment, makes this look a lot easier (and smaller!) thanks Eetere for pointing out that was added to KC3, seriously didn't know that was there.<ac_metadata title="Not sure who to level in prep for Summer 2017"> </ac_metadata>
