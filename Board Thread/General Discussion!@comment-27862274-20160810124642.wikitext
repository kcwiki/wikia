<p style="font-weight:normal;">Does having multiple accounts on the same network get you banned? I have 2, but i don't use one anymore because i only used it to build ships a while ago when i was a noob without realising i had breached DMM's terms of use. But i haven't touched it for months. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">If so, what are the odds i will get banned? Apparently they do not ban based on ip address, but whether one user uses multiple accounts. I'm just thinking that since i haven't touched the other acc for a while, i *might* be safe? </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">The emails also have different addresses and do not share any particular names or anything - apart from ip address and are also accessed from different computers. </p><ac_metadata title="Regarding multi-accounting"> </ac_metadata>
