I found this 2D live mod for Kancolle, and since it looks pretty awesome, i really want to try it. But after i watched the youtube tutorial and read the comments, it seems that some people are getting banned, and for some it doesnt work on their browser. I wanted to know if someone uses or has used this before and confirm wether you get banned or not, and if it works on their browser.

If there is some people who want to try this 2D mod, ill put the links down below, but like i said, you might get banned so be careful.
