Hi, whenever I log in either via web or KCV, one has to click Twitter sign in, then either re-enter url or click dmm > my games > kancolle ... Is there a way how to be taken directly to the game's page by going to its URL without going through the login page? (at least not always, say at most once a week)<ac_metadata title="Remember DMM login"> </ac_metadata>
