Hi! At first, I would like to thank you for previous advices - these were very helpful and I was able to get Kashima, though E-4 was still too much for me. But still, I need to admit I haven't leveled every girl that needed it - I'm lazy and I think that's bigger problem than leveling itself. And Shigure got her kai ni during event, so yeah. About clearing - I don't even need to clear everything, I just would like to get at least one event ship. 

Also - I still feel like I haven't do everything that I should on this HQ lvl (currently 86), like I should have higher level ships and better equipment and everything. 

I'm currently trying to level Kako which was suggested previous time, however things get complicated after Taigei's (waifu, however now she's Ryuuhou) and Yamato's appearance. 

About equipment - I have serious problem with the lack of equipment for DDs and clearing E-3 was pain (also Akitsu Maru appeared after I cleared it...).
