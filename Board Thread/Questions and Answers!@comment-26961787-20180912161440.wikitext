I had this problem when KC update to HTML5. The game froze when enter shelling phase, the gear symbol at top left still spinning but the game completely stopped no matter how long I wait. It happened when I go to another tab and back to KC tab.

At first, I thought it could be my computer hardware (Celeron N2840 + 2GB RAM). Then I tried to upgrade my RAM into 4GB, but my computer only 2.9GB usable (1.1GB hardware reserved), maybe my mainboard was too old or window or whatever, it doesn't matter because I  only open 1-3 tabs along with KC, and RAM usage never exceed 2.6GB. Then it's not my RAM issue anymore and KC works well last week.

But now it happened again. I went to 3-3 for Bw, first node choose formation and I open another tab youtube (I didn't open video), and turn back to KC... you know why I'm here. I tried 3 times but still the same. In addition, yesterday I cleared 4-1 6 times for Bw but nothing happen.

I asked this question on discord once but no one answer. Now I really desperate, if it come to my computer problem that cannot run KC anymore then I had no choice but quit KC. I had no idea what hanppening to KC or the cause of it. If somebody know something please help. Thanks<ac_metadata title="KC stopped when I change tab?"> </ac_metadata>
