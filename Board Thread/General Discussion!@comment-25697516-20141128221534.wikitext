- From Chinese Community

Come across some really nice interface changing/ redrawing cards by various Chinese, they even modify what they look like in game. its truly something amazing. Using Shimakaze Go you can actually redesign any characters in game , even how they look on the battlefield/ CGs etc. its very impressive stuff.Â
