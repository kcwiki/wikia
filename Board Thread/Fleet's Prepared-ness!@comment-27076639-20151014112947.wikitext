[[File:Hfdhgd.jpg|thumb]][[File:Ghdsdgd.jpg|thumb]]If this event will be medium-scale only, I am hoping, that I can at least complete all maps (I dont really care if last ones will be on easy, I am aiming mainly for ship rewards). Previous event failed for me because of crazy difficulty (last one) or simply because I didnt have required ships on adequate level or amount.

Right now I am grinding Abukuma and Nachi to at least Kai2, Littorio to some reasonable level, Yukikaze (I get her on 3-3 fishing yesterday, yay) and Mizuho (because AV).

For equip crafting I am focusing on AP shells with 10/90/90/30.

Sorry for bad english and thanks for some useful advices...<ac_metadata title="So... Do you thing that I can at least complete the event?"> </ac_metadata>
