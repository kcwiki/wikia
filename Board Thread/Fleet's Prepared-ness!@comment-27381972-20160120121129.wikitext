[[File:FEUER.png|thumb|ABKM will be kai ni'd at Feb 1, im just short on medals]]My fleet, full of underleveled CL and DD's. . . maybe because when i was a noob i thought DD's and CL's were shit, (No offense). But as i progress I figured, i fucked up, thats why im aiming to train my under leveled DD-CL's at the maps i already cleared (especially when theres a rare drop and the map is easy to clear). Anyways, im just orel cruising upto this day[[File:PANPAKAPAKAPAPAKAPAN.png|thumb|left|238px]]<ac_metadata title="Easy and Medium Difficulty (Medal farming). Am I going to Survive?"> </ac_metadata>
