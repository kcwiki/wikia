<p>I started experiencing frequent catbombs on the 2nd day of the event. At first I thought it was just busy servers or a glitch. I thought it would go away after the emergency maintenance but it didn't. After trying everything from clearing cache to using vpn, nothing worked. I even tried using a friend's internet but same problem. I asked my friend to use his account on my pc and surprisingly he didn't get any catbomb. I have no idea what the problem is, can anyone help me?</p>
