Around two days ago I tried to get into the game but was redirected to the the main kancolle page. I tried logging in but it says my email and password don't match. Worried I was hacked, I selected to reset password but the message told me the email I entered was not registered. I tried registering my email but I was told the email was already registered and I could change my password. I tried and I got the same message that my email was not registered. Turning off VPN and swithcing to english didn't help and the link they provided to an english help lead to a 404 error. Thx in advance to anyone who can help.<ac_metadata title="Can&#039;t login to DMM"> </ac_metadata>
