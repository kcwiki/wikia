Hi there wikia users,

I would like to know: whats your favorite way to play the game and why? Maybe you would like to point out certain features of your Tool of choice.

I just tested KC3 for Chrome and I gotta say it does improve the game in terms of user friendliness (not sure if thats the correct term). It adds notifications for repairs, expeditions and other helpful things. I think there are definitely advantages by using it, because it makes the daily transportship farm and such way easier. (It show you an enemy ship kill prediction, which is like 99% accurate I believe.) There is also stuff like in-depth quest counters (36 weekly sortie quest anyone?) or even complete translations.

But I still prefer to play through the DMM page because KC3 takes some of the game's magic away. Im trying to learn some Kanji too, so stuff like the translation is not relevant for me. But I could see myself using it during events though, especially to compile Fleet/Equipment lists. I have not yet tested KCV or other Tools to play Kancolle.<ac_metadata title="How do you play Kancolle? (KCV, KC3, DMM, other)"> </ac_metadata>
