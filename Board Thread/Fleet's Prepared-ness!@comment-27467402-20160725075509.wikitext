So, here's my fleet and equipment. I took advice from everyone from my last post, and I'm pleased to say that my fleet has become very powerful. Thanks for the advice and tips. 



Ships that will be heavily grinded:

-Hiryuu will definitely hit Kai 2 and I will do the quest chain that unlocks the [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Tenzan_Model_12_(Tomonaga_Squadron) Tomo Tenzan] as well as the [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Suisei_(Egusa_Squadron) Egusa Suisei]

-Katori and Yub-Yub will most likely reach to the point where they'll perform the pre-emptive ASW attack

-Kako, Haguro, and Furutaka (when I get her) will become Kai 2

-Tone will receive next month's blueprint for her Kai 2

-Ise will reach at least 70. Fusou may be ignored until after the event

-Another Shioi will hit Kai and give me a 2nd Proto Seiran

If you got any other suggestions, feel free to leave them down and suggest a difficulty.

(The Type 91 AP shells are at +6)

Wow! What a cool fleet! Why is this person asking for help? Because of this:

[[File:Resources@.png|left]]I'm expecting to have at least 950 buckets on the first day of the event.

'''This will be the highest bucket count I have ever had.'''



The resources look like they're in a somewhat good shape, but that isn't the case

'''I had stockpiled the most resources I had ever had at one time in preparation for the Spring 2016, including buckets. However, I had to do a full easy run in order to get Iowa, and I failed E-5.'''

I'm currently running Expedition 2, 21, and 38 and Expedition 9, 24, and 38 over night. I do believe I babysit my expeditions well, and I even have Kancolle for Andriod.

I've recently started casual 2-3 cruising for more fuel+ammo as well.



Should I change the expeditions?

How do I cut down on Fuel+Ammo for my sorties+exercises while still grinding levels for my ships? 

I really need assistance on this matter since resources are the only thing that is holding me back from doing an event on Hard or even Medium for that matter. Thanks for your time<ac_metadata title="Resource Planning for Summer 2016"> </ac_metadata>
