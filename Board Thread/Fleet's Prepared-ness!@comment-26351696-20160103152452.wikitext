Lots of people say that next event is difficult, I aim to clear Normal/Hard maps which I think it is not possible with this fleet condition : Here is the full ship list and plan I need in mind. I think that my problem here is quantity. The amount of useable ships here in the fleet is not enough to deal with ship locking yet thus stuck in clearing in easy mode. I do come up with this plan but as usual, despite I have played for almost a year now but I am getting nowhere. Any comment or suggestion on the fleet situation and/or prioritising so that the next event will be less salt for me and the fleet.

<tabber>DD=
I am not sure about if amount of destroyers in the fleet is enough for event and to which level should I level them to

The Kongou class is enough I think but they may suffer from accuracy penalty of carrying big guns. Maybe need to level those Nagato class or Italian ships, but this is not high priority though

CV is clearly the weak link of the fleet. Level them is the highest priority to get good planes. Need to level some destroyers and light cruiser to help finish catapult quest line though.

Here is my notable equipment list. I think I have to craft more Reppuu (or get some planes from quests) and AP shells. I now have 350 buckets and 20k fuel, 15K ammo, 30K steel, and 24K bauxite.Â <ac_metadata title="What can I do within a month or two?"> </ac_metadata>
