Hello guys,

I've been playing KC for years as a casual+ player. I somehow managed to clear 7 events full hard overall. However, the more I try to do hard modo the more I find myself less prepared even though I almost hard cap resources every event. Therefore, I can only conclude that my fleet and equipements aren't suited (yet!) for hard.

I honestly and shamefully didn't pay attention to my equipements and their approvement, I neglected Akashi's work and didn't measure its importance. Today, there is so much to do that I don't know where to start and what to focus on for the upcoming event.

So, my main question is which equipement(s) should I focus on ? and how much star I should aim for ?

And about my fleet/girls, is there any weakness I should fix ?

Currently, I'm leveling Kurita/Suzuki's DDs on 4-3, I aim at first to level all of them to 70, then if I still have the time I'll go for lvl 80.Â

Any suggestions, opinions, critics are more than welcome !

Thank you in advance.<ac_metadata title="[Event Preparation] What should I focus on to full hard Winter 2018 ?"> </ac_metadata>
