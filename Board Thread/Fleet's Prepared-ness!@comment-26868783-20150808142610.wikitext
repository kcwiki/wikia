just want a last check on my kanmusu (felt unconfident after realise other TTK in here have better fleet than me orz) 

Sorry I know it's too late to make any changes now, but at least I want some advice for future event :P oh and I only pray to get new event kanmusu, so I'll going all map in easy ^^

Now grinding Tone to Kai-2~

'''Resource'''


Fuel : 20226

Ammo : 15047

Steel : 24875

Bauxite : 19742

*note : I know this event at least 4 CV and reppuu will be needed, but I just can't craft both of them (60++ tried with Kaga still didn't create 1 new reppuu & 20++ all CVL or AV ==") sorry but don't scolded me over this :P Oh and BB I just don't want to train them, they eat my resource (especially ammo) really bad...

HQ level : 87 (grind on 1-5 too much...)
