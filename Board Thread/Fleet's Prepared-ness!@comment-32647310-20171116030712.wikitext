...or should I pretend that I'm even remotely ready for anything other than Easy Mode?

The tl;dr version is this:<br />
I have concerns about my fleet in general because of the nature of this event (Nishimura requirements, Yasen final battle, ship levels and equipment status, etc.). Should I just stick with Easy Mode all the way through or should I make a genuine effort for Medium?

Also, how should I look to prepare myself for Winter? I don't have Mushashi or Yamato and I generally have poor confidence in myself and my ability to make a good fleet.



Long version:<br />
I have concerns about my fleet readiness and my general progression in the game up to this point as a general thing. In regards to this event, I can't help but feel I got caught with my pants down because of the Nishimura requirements and I'm just not ready.

I say this because I have never gotten Asagumo and when I started focusing on leveling ships after Summer, I was not looking at the Nishimuras and had used both Yamagumo and Michishio as modernization fodder at some point before, during and after that event because I got them both to Kai and completed any associated quests. And the ships I have been leveling of the right class/type in regards to BBs and CA/CAVs was the Kongou-sisters, Nagato, Suzuya, Kumano and the Myoukou-sisters and had been pretty much ignoring the Fusou-sisters and Mogami.

Now, after learning about the Nishimura requirements and potential Shima requirements, I've spent a lot of time in 4-3 leveling up the first Michishio and Yamagumo that dropped as well as put a focus on the ships that were lacking (Fusou and Yamashiro were level 40 when I found out about the requirements), but I have had to since stop that so I could focus on saving fuel and ammo so any additional leveling will happen through PvP and expeditions as well as the event itself.

As of right now, here are my resources:<br />
Fuel: ~52k, Ammo: ~51k, Steel: ~56k, Bauxite: ~67k Buckets: 471

These aren't final because I intend on continuing to run high-value expeditions and use Orel Cruising to take care of my dailies (and weeklies if needed) until I actually start the event (I was going to wait a couple of days before starting to see what the Frontliners come up with).

...so am I crazy for thinking I can even look at anything other than Easy? Is trying for Medium or Hard on a map or two worthwhile, or should I just save my sanity until my ships are higher level and I have more end-game gear?
