Uhh, yeah



I tried to play on Chrome stable, subtitles appear for every other ship but not my waifu Yahagi's



I read up on another thread about using Chromium and shiz, the nearest thing I got to using (and somehow I like better) is Chrome Canary. I tried playing KC on Canary and still a no-go...



Since it happens on different Chrome clients and subtitles appear for literally every other shipgirl except Yahagi on both Chrome Stable and Canary, I think it's a issue on the devs' end.



Is there a workaround or I have to bring this up to the devs?<ac_metadata title="Subtitles appear for every other ship but not Yahagi"> </ac_metadata>
