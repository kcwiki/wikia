Hi guys, WindFairies here!

Thanks to y'all i managed to clear my first event (Summer 2016, albeit on full easy) even though i was just 2.5 months old at that time... And now, Fall 2016 is coming... Lets try Medium shall we?

Some comments:

1. 45k Fuel, 41k Ammo, 92k Steel, 55k Baux and 230 Buckets (working on ammo and buckets)

2. Sadly i still failed to convice the quest-musu to come to my base (FCF is important isn't it?)

3. I plan to get Akitsushima, Akitsumaru and Mizuho to their Kai form, any suggestions of places i could powerlevel them in short time?

4. And as always, critics and recommendation are greatly welcomed...
