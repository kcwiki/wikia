Greetings to all who wandered into this discussion. Usually I'm fine with my fleet, but rumor says a large event is coming, so I figured I would ask around to see how I can improve certain things.Anyway, here are the lists:

Currently I am leveling up Satsuki, Nachi (a bit overdue to be honest), and Yamato. I also need to start leveling up other important ships like a dupe Chitose/Chiyoda and Chikuma...hopefully some time in the near future. For equipments I am using the screws to level up some guns such as HAFD and main batteries, getting 1-2 more seaplane fighters, and also some m21 or m52 skilled fighters. Thanks for your time and I appreciate any helpful feedback!<ac_metadata title="Semi-Veteran Seeking Guidance"> </ac_metadata>
