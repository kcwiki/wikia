[[File:DaShipsPt.1.jpg|thumb|400px]][[File:DaShipsPt.2.jpg|thumb|400px]]A few things I should mention is that I am currently working on: ''Kiso ''(Lv. 32) for my second '''Torpedo Cruiser'''

''Aoba ''(Lv. 7) for a quick access '''Heavy Cruiser''' (and for that awesome 30 luck)

''Isokaze ''for my 6th '''Destroyer '''(Lv. 29 - I am a Fate series fanboy and I love her VA). 

I have a ''Tone ''(Lv. 1), however, I don't think I'll be able to level her before the event starts and I also don't have any blueprints. 

I do daily quests for buckets, currently have 80.

That should be it and thanks for the advice everyone!<ac_metadata title="This will be my first event, which I am really excited for. I want to know where I stand and what I should do before it starts."> </ac_metadata>
