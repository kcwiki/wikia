There seems to have been a misunderstanding that users have been unable to edit the event pages and articles. This is not the case, this restriction only applies to newly created accounts or unregistered users. 

This was done in order to combat  trolling, vandalizing, conflicting or unwarranted edits that might be detrimental to our users during the event when there is so much uncertainty out there.

I am very, VERY sorry for causing this misunderstanding. I have no excuse, I'm sorry I was not being completely clear with my choice of words.

Please, help us build the event pages together. Let us make this event a great one despite all the hardships we will be facing together! 

Fight on, ladies and gentlemen! (૭。 ワ ﾟ )૭<ac_metadata title="Clarifying misunderstandings" notify_everyone="1462379349"> </ac_metadata>
