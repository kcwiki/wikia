Recently I've seen that some of my ships have higher stats than others at lvl one even tho they are the same ship. Is that because one's a crafted and the other's a dropped ship? And does it affect max stats? (would suck since im grinding hibiki up to 70 and then to find out she gets lower stats)<ac_metadata title="Stat bonus?"> </ac_metadata>
