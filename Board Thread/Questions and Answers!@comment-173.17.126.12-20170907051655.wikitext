<span style="font-weight:normal;">So I just recently got Akashi and Yuudachi Kai Ni so I figured to test this I would look towards making Yuudachi a second 12.7cm Twin Gun Mount Model B Kai 2. Right now it is up to a 6 star 12.7cm Twin Gun Mount. What exactly do the stars even do though? Because just looking at it in the quipment screen I can see it is improved to lv6 but it has no discernible better stats. How does this actually function in the game? Because if it is just a star level tracking how long it will take before it is just improved tot eh next level of equipment then I can't see any reason to improve equipment unless you are actually looking for obtainign that next level of equiment.</span><ac_metadata title="Akashi&#039;s Improved Arsenal"> </ac_metadata>
