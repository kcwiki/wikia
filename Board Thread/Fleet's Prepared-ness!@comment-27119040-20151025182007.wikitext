So hahahahahah oh god.

It's an event! How exciting! I've never done one before, so this should be good fun, right?

Yeah. I looked around a bit, and... um... yeah. Not looking good for me.

But have a picture.[[File:KanColle-151026-04592836.png|thumb|400px|LOOKING GOOD]]

And as you can see, not so great, hm?

These are my best and brightest girls, really.

Though, I have a lvl 53 Hibiki, lvl 44 Melon, a lvl 43 Yamashiro, and all the other three Kongou sisters are hovering around mid 30s...

My Akagi is lvl 25. I also have a Hiyou at lvl 28. And I won't even bother mentioning the rest of my ships, as they are likely of no consequence. You can see from my rescources up there, I'm not doing great on buckets. Or anything else for that matter.

I almost never use carriers, yet my bauxite is looking... oddly low. Oh well.

SO WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK. I want to do medium hopefully. Or, at least just get the drops. Whatever they are.<ac_metadata title="There&#039;s No Way My Little Fleet Can Clear It&#039;s First Event"> </ac_metadata>
