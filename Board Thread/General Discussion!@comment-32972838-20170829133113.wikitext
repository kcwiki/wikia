Hello,

I've been working with AE a lot over the last couple of months and I can't find any tutorials on achieving this type of animation experimenting for a bit by trying to mimic the background color transitions, but it just doesn't seem fluid and smooth like in the [http://blog.advids.co/20-minimalist-animated-video-marketing-examples/ minimalist animation video] (even with easing on my keyframes). I tried motion blur as well, but since the minimalist animation is so fast they look like gradients, taking away from the very flat minimalist look. If anyone could guide me in the right direction that would be great.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

Thank you. <ac_metadata title="Smooth minimalist animation" lastmove="1504014983"> </ac_metadata>
