As it's been 2 days since the debate which can be seen [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:558979 here] and [https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/6b34rr/discussion_abbreviation_to_use_for_kaiboukan/ here], it is time that we settle on the classification of the Kaiboukan

Keep in mind the following regarding this poll:
* This poll will close on 20-05-2017 at 05:00 JST. It is the same time when the quest resets take place.
* You must be logged in with a gmail.
* You will not be able to see the results. The results will be announced when the poll closes.

You are recommended to read through the discussions first to gain an understanding as to what is happening, before you decide to cast your vote.

You can access the poll through this [https://goo.gl/forms/mdWwHb8gPzaQg9oH2 link].

Good luck. <ac_metadata title="Poll: Choose the classification of the Kaiboukan"> </ac_metadata>
