So my friend has been playing less frequently, so I went ahead and made an account to ask the community!

This is going to be my 3rd event. I was only half prepared for the previous two, so this time I want to come out of the event not crying AS much.

As far as I can tell, I probably need a bit more CVL and need to level up my CAVs a little bit more?

Also any critiques on my post layout. New to this posting on wikis/fourms in general.
