I just started playing kancolle last feb 1, 2017. I'm currently at hq lvl 16. I know that I would not be able to participate in any event since my ships aren't up to scratch yet. So to be able to join events in the future, what do you veterans/pros recommend to new players like me? What ships are relevant enough to be Kai'd and K2'd? What expeditions should I frequently go on to? Thanks in advance!<ac_metadata title="New player here."> </ac_metadata>
