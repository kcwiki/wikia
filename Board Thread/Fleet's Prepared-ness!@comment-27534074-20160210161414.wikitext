is my status right now isn't enough ? is there something that i lack ? or is it enough for me to at least join the event at easy difficulty ? [[File:Shipcheck.png|thumb|left|340px]][[File:Shipcheck2.png|thumb|left|358px]][[File:Shipcheck3.png|thumb|left|350px]][[File:Shipcheck4.png|thumb|left|350px]][[File:Resourcecheck.png|thumb|left|400px]]<ac_metadata title="Fleet Check Newbie"> </ac_metadata>
