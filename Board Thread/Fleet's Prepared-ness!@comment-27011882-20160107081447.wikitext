I am now HQ level 57, that means I need to head on with a better enemy SS fleet

all my ship that sent to 1-5 are over level 30-40, one of them are level 55+ (ofc yuudachi k2)

and I've found that RNG keep pissing me off, always one ship who gets no damage to enemy SS at the boss node and failed the mission with the boss still having ~1-10 HP left.

I am also preparing for 3-2 so I dnon't want to put that many time trying to build type 3 sonar and deapth charge, and I only have 1 type 3 sonar for the weaker ASW DD, and filled them with type 93 and type 94.



well, a full DD fleet is good for me, but 1-5 required AV/CV (L)/ CAV or BBV to go to the boss node, and those ship's ASW is completely crap with full leveled up plane, and CV (L) resist to send torp/bomber out to kill enemy SS (if not then why they still have +4 ASW for them?)



so what's the best setup? should I do daily mission and keep farming for type 3?<ac_metadata title="1-5"> </ac_metadata>
