Hi there, I'm wondering what I should do the next two weeks, in preparation for Fall 2k15. I have already cleared 1-5 to 4-5. You can see my shiplist and equipment list on my profile here : http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User:Muuus. You can hover the number of upgraded equipment to see the details (like how many stars). I know I'm damned short on radar, but that craft is expensive, and I have absolutely no luck with those. Should I go full bauxite in expedition and spam craft ? Also, is there any need to grind a particular ship ? About Akashi, I'm rotating between 38cmKai, 381mm/50Kai, Quint, sometimes Type22Kai4 or Type 32, is there any need to upgrade other equipments ?<ac_metadata title="How to spend the next two weeks (preparing Hard mode) ?"> </ac_metadata>
