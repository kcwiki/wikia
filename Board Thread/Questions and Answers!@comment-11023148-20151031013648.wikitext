Hello,

I'm looking to start playing kancolle but ran into an issue with the network error. I've tried using VPN,API link, KC viewer, none worked. I've also synced my time clock. 

I did notice that I can not ping this IP: 125.6.189.103. Is that the source of my problem? 

Any assistance will be greatly appreciated!!!<ac_metadata title="Network error"> </ac_metadata>
