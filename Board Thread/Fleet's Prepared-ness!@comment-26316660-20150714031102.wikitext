I already have well-prepared ships and resource, including LSC capital ships, married CLTs, CI DDs, Maya K2, etc. But I need ur suggestion about which equipment should I prioritize to upgrade for next event, since atm I only have 29 improvement mats, and I want to take advantage of daily improvement quest. Ofc I will clear my weekly World 3 boss and 3x 1-5 sortie quest after 50 transport.

This is my list of my upgraded equipments. Expect I don't upgrade other equipments outside this list. Also Mutsu kinda hates me. She always refuse to comes out, when in fact I badly need her 41cm for my italian and bismarck T_T. One mistake that I did in the past, I remodeled my 35.6cm to proto >_<.
