So as stated i have encountered a problem where the "Factory" menu texture is missing from my cache files. I have tried clearing my cache and cookies as well as fresh installing Firefox and both times the Factory texture just seems to be missing. Is there any solution to this where i can possibly manually download the missing texture?[[File:MissingTextureError.png|thumb|Error of missing texture]] The picture attached is the error code seen in the console of my web browser.<ac_metadata title="Missing Menu Texture"> </ac_metadata>
