DD: 5*lv.70-80, 4*lv.60-70, should have been enough in most cases, but might be levelling shimakaze and yukikaze from 30-ish to 50-ish would help.
CL: Sendai67 Jintsuu66 Naka53 Isuzu52 Yuubari32 Yahagi29 Nagara22. should get all those 5500t class up to 50+ level. But obtaining ooyodo would help much more while at the same time costing much more.
CLT: Kiso72 KTKM62 Ooi41. ooi need kaini.
CA:Nachi52 Maya46 Haguro27 Ashigara23 and that's it. severely lacking. need to get at least 5 CA to lv.45 before event start for a higher chance to pass event easy...
CAV:Mogami40 Mikuma35. Have to get rest of mogami class to kai.
AV: Chitose24 Chiyoda21 Akitsushima17. lower priority as it is not expected to use them during event.
CVL:Chitose56 Chiyoda37 Hiryuu29 Souhou22....vulnerable to shiplocking.
CV:Akagi60 Kaga56 Souryuu40 Zuikaku27 Katauragi26 Shoukaku18. CD2 and CD5 need to work it up to reduce retreat rate.
BB: Mutsu57 Haruna52 Littorio35 Hiei34 Nagato32.Kongou31 Kirishima30. all 40 is target with 55 being temporary goal. Lacking of bismarck would uneasing some part.
BBV:Ise50 Yamashiro47 Fusou34 Hyuuga30. shouldn't be the obstacle.
SS:I-58/8/168/19 40/36/34/28. Maruyu21. and rons of other lower leveled.should tackle most case unless it require a full SS fleet.
LHA: Akitsumaru25. will do on demand levelling if she is needed.
