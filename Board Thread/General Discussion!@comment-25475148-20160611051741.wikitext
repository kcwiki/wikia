2 days ago, I got message from DMM that I need to change my password. I entered my email address correctly but the mail won't come. until today, I still not received it even I wrote my address numerous times. It never happened to me before.

I wanted to contact DMM help form, but since I doesn't know Japanese very well, I want to ask helps for translator. Lastly, I want to say thank you and sorry for being bothering you all<ac_metadata title="DMM Password Reset"> </ac_metadata>
