I was chatting with my friends iIn China and they said Kancolle have a Chinese server over there......

I was pretty shock once I saw it, as a Chinese I was not surprised some people will do that but the crew which running this server is taking people`s money from it.

Should we report it to DMM and Kadokawa? I did already, but I don`t know if it will help or not.

Here is the link if anybody interested or want to learn about it.

And I think the setup is the same too....[[File:2C050CB66E592D61BC4D285C620B1C48.jpg|frame|left|Really, Prinz for first time in-game purchase]]<ac_metadata title="So.....I found this...."> </ac_metadata>
