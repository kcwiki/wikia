With this month's medals from 1-5 and 2-5, I will have another blueprint and I'm not sure who I should use it on.  Current candidates are Tone (already at lvl 70), Abukuma (lvl 59), Choukai (lvl 54), Katsuragi (lvl 46), and Yamashiro (lvl 51).  

Relevant fleet info: (ships are at final remodel, lvl 60+ and max modernization except AA)

CV: Taihou, Kaga, Akagi, Hiryuu, Souryuu, Zuikaku, Shoukaku

BBV: Fuso, Hyuuga, Ise (only lvl 43)

CA/CAV: Myoukou sisters, Maya, Kako, Suzuya and Kumano (only lvl 54)

CL/CLT: Sendai sisters, Kuma CLT trio

Yamashiro seems unlikely given the remaining time and I already have Fuso.  My only CAV right now are Suzuya and Kumano so Tone is appealing to fill that void.  On the other hand, Abukuma is a nice use of the usual required CL slot in combined fleets, giving you an extra CLT.  Choukai is the strongest CA, but I already have quite a few in that slot and I already have a skilled lookout.   The next event is a CV centric event, but I'm already reasonably confident in my CV lineup, so I kinda doubt I need Katsuragi.<ac_metadata title="What to use my Blueprint on"> </ac_metadata>
