Hi guys! Today some of us just got [[User_blog:CDRW/Admin_Application_2015|promoted to admin]]. I'm one of them, thus am now able to implement some of the features I've been [[User:Dragonjet/Laboratory|brewing for some time now]].

| valign="top" |'''Sidebar Boxes'''

The feature gives us the ability to add boxes to the wiki right sidebar. This will be useful for categorizing pages and navigation. This is has lots of potential on pages such as the [[Anime]], [[Merchandise]], or even game pages that had been broken down.

| valign="top" |'''Anon IPs'''

Instead of seeing "A wikia contributor", you will now instantly see IP addresses in anonymous comments and edits. This will also slightly improve communication by knowing who is who - if you're still talking to the same one - even without hovering on their link.

|-
|[[File:Countdown.png|left|200px]]
| valign="top" |'''Countdown Timer'''

Now we have a countdown timer until the next maintenance, under "Future Updates" on the [[Recent Updates]] page.
