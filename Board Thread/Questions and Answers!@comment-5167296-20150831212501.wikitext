Hi guys, as you can see it's been a few days now ever since the rabaul base server overload that happened during the past weekend and even until now I still couldn't directly login to the game unless I use VPN...I usually go just API + KCV which been working ever since but somehow I just couldn't login even though I renewed my API a few times and cleared my cache(IE &Chrome since I also tried directly playing on just API only) I still couldn't bypass the boat load after the start button...I'm always quite scared just going API + KCV + VPN as that may lead me to a ban probably since you need to use a different IP everytime if one doesn't work or suddenly gets disconnects you from the host. I tried asking help from some other forums and I couldn't get some answers oh why this is happening only to me since I don't even see people complaining so it probably means in the not a server issue right?<ac_metadata title="Couldn&#039;t login directly into the game anymore..."> </ac_metadata>
