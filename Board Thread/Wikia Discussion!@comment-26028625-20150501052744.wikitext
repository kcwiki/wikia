I saw in the "Music" page and found that audio player is so nice. After that, I realized I wanted to add this template to other games wikia, too. Can someone here teach me how to create that amazing template.

I would be appreciated to all answers. Thank you.<ac_metadata title="[Question] I would like to know about Template:Audio"> </ac_metadata>
