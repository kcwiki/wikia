Well, I've been playing since early May and this is technically my third event I'm about to participate (The first one, Spring, ended disasteriously, with literally not even a scratch on the first boss [as I'm constantly taken away. I was extremely new back then and I was just going around and learning basic things]. The second one, Summer, was hard for me, even on easy. I cleared the first two maps with ease, but the third one was trying to get through the bitch tender and failed at it).

So far, I've stockpiled up my resources to soft cap, except for bauxite, which I haven't got up to standard, sitting around 7000. My ships, not sure if they're ready yet. Haven't been levelling much due to work and exams going on right now.

EDIT: Oh yeah, I do have radar, with one Type 14 Air Radar, five Type 21 Air Radars and one Type 22 Surface Radar<ac_metadata title="Am I ready yet to take a crack on Medium?"> </ac_metadata>
