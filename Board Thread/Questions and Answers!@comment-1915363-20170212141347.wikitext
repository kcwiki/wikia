One thing that has been bothering me since I started played online game is... why do they have offline maintenance in the first place? What in the world is keeping them from developing the patch in test server or something like that and push the updates straight into the game server as a live update?

I dunno about the internal stuffs, but for the game client itself they could've simply specify the next update timer to schedule the game asset and master data re-downloads.<ac_metadata title="Why do online games like Kancolle have offline maintenance?"> </ac_metadata>
