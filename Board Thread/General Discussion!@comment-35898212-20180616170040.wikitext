My game wont load. It wont even reach the load screen It just sticks at a the black screen. It didnt do this before the update. I went out of town for a few days and didnt have internet and when I came back it worked fine for the first few hours. Then I tried to play it the next day and it just sticks at the black screen before it starts to oad. I tried logging in and out of my account and that didnt work. Any suggestions? <ac_metadata title="Game wont load, sticks at black screen" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
