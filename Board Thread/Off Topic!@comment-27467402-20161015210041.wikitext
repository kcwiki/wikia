So, I'm doing a personal research project, and I need someone to help with out with translating these documents. The bulk of it is in Kanji, but there is also Katakana and Hiragana as well. I'm looking for information specifically of the Triple 41cm Superfiring turret. What I'm namely looking for are the weight, armor , elevation, RoF, traverse speed, shell weight, and shell velocity. It's marked by "III - 45 - 41" and that basic drawing in the handwritten portion (circle with 3 lines). I sort of have a general idea as to what those numbers may be, but I want to make sure I don't get this wrong. Thanks!
