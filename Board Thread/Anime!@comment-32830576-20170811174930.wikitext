Guys there's been some rumors that the 2nd season was cancelled by Kadokawa or the works have been stopped. But I only saw in some sites our groups this information and noone is talking about it even Kadokawa. Does anyone know if it is 100% confrimed and what is it exactly stopped or cancelled, or know the reason why?<ac_metadata title="KanColle 2nd Season Cancelled?"> </ac_metadata>
