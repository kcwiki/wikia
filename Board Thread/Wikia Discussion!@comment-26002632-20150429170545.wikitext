During the event so far I have been alphabetizing the drop tables in order to make them easier to read, and to prevent duplicate entires from being added. In the proccess of doing so I decided to look at some of the other tables on the wiki and noticed that there seems to be no one consitant pattern for doing them. The way I have been doing them thus far is to sort them by apart by normal and S-rank only (red text) and alphabetize. Should I apply this pattern to the rest of the tables or is there one in the apparent chaos that I do not see? In any case, thanks for your time. <ac_metadata title="Drop table formatting"> </ac_metadata>
