So yesterday i try to open the game using KVC+API which how I usually play the game, and then I got a cat image page, then I try to get a new AP link and it didn't work on the KVC, after that I refreshed the game on IE and get the new API and try to play the API without KVC and I still getting the cat page. Then I try to use a vpn to play the game on IE and it works fine. I copy the API and try to use it and get another cat page. Then instead of using a vpn, I tried to use the option that you comy some code on IE consele (the f12 one) and try to play the game normally on dmm page and get a nother cat page.

Now I can't seem to play the game other than by using a vpn on dmm page which is suck and inconvenient. I don't know why this is happening since the game work fine to me before yesterday<ac_metadata title="Is it just me or I can&#039;t play using API link anymore"> </ac_metadata>
