Here's my final post of my fleet![[File:Resobabe.jpg|thumb]][[File:Final_fleet.jpg|thumb]][[File:Equip.jpg|thumb]][[File:Lvlbabes.jpg|thumb]]

I'm gonna make this simple and easy.

I wanna atleast finish the event at Medium difficulty..

probs gonna finish the first few maps on hard if i can.

I will go on switch on easy if the mediums is too hard.

I Iz gonna K2 all of ships in the last pic. (before the event)

I'll get my resources up to 45-50k after the modernisation.

I just got Zekamashi a week ago and lvled her up.

I will probobly start at day 2 of the event to make sure of the

enemy fleet, plan my shiplocking and farmable shipgirls that

I wanted. (Soz for bad and thuggish engrish. not my native language)



I iz not gonna rush the event btw<ac_metadata title="Yet another fleet check up for my first event."> </ac_metadata>
