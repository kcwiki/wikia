I know I shouldn't ask anything here anymore cause I've already cleared final map in Fall 15 and Winter 16, but since they were having a very hard time clearing E-3 Hard, taking 20 runs to ship the boss down, and a few more runs for last dance, despite I did a full sparkle on all of them. (Yes, all 12 ships, not to mention that I send out boss support in every run.) And that time the devs only said it'd be "a little bit" harder. This time they say it's gonna be a "Total war", that shake my confidence even more, so if I could have some advice on what to improve, I'd be really appreciated.

Note: some of my girls might seem good, but I'm really worried about this. Just to make it clear that I'm not trolling or boasting about my fleet or anything.
