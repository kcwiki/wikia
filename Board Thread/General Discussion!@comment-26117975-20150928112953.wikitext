|EN01 = Tonight, the DMM's platform as a whole seems to be experiencing some communication issues. All of Kancolle's Game Servers are still healthy. We are currently checking out the situation, and would like to ask Admirals who are currently on the game to not exit the game.
※ It is currently extremely difficult to log back into DMM's platform.
|JP01 = 本日夜、DMMさんのプラットフォーム全体に通信障害が発生している模様です。「艦これ」稼働全ゲームサーバは健在です。状況を確認中ですが、現在接続中の提督方は「艦これ」を終了しないようお願い申し上げます。
※DMMプラットフォームへの再ログインは、現在極めて難しい状況です。

==TL (translator) notes==
* By micro-transactions they mean when the player purchases in-game items. Notable examples can be found in [[Shop]].
* By new logins it is when and if the user visits DMM site and is required to login '''before''' they can play the game.
