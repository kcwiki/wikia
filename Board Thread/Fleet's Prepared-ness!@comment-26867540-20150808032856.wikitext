As the title stated, a last minute check to see if my fleet can at least pass easy mode. This is my first event!

HQ: 94 Resources: 22k fuel, 20k ammo, 27k of both steel and bauxite. 580 buckets. I plan to rely on natural regen and running expeditions during event. Plus I will wait a bit for the information that older admirals will gather for us newbies before starting the event for real. Let's hope that's enough!

[[File:Upload_1.png|thumb]][[File:Upload_2.png|thumb]]Should I do some more last minute 3-2-A grinding? I also have an Akitsumaru. I think I'll let her leech EXP till kai and then modernize her. Is that enough?

Equipments: Anything else I should craft? Or should I just hope for more Reppuus now?

Thank you for all advice!

P.S. I do not have Akashi yet so I can't improve my equipment. ;_;

P.P.S. I have 5 Maruyus and I will kai them and use them for modernization before I go into the event. Who should I feed them to? Kitakami? Ayanami K2?<ac_metadata title="Last minute check (easy mode)"> </ac_metadata>
