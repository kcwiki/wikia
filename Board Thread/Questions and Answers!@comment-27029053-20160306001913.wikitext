The following is pretty much all my DD class ships that haven't had their final upgrade and their levels.  Name organized what levels and how many copies I have of it.   As the title states, what should I focus on from here, I know my high level DD's are kinda small.  And sorry for the long post, not sure how to NOT double space everything....
