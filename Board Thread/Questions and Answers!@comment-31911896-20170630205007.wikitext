Hello all, I've been suffering from this error since April of this year. This only occurs in the beginning of the month. I keep getting the connection errors what seems to be every 5 mins or so, it occurs right after the battle ends, right after my expedition fleet comes back, and sometimes during when I'm sorting my fleet.

Because the error occurs way too frequently I'm unable to play basically every beginning day of the month. What strange is that, all is fixed in the next day. I know I should just wait till then but I just don't know why this is happening to me.

I've been contacting support since the error started happening but haven't got shit from them and it doesn't seem to be fixed because today is July 1st in Japan and I just had this error again.

Since I'm playing from the US, I thought maybe changing the clock to Japan would help. That didn't work, so what I tried next is set the clock to Japan, then I used OpenVPN to change my IP address to Japan. Surprisingly that didn't work as well. I'm beginning to suspect my kancolle account is being monitored by some kind of program or some shit (And no I never used any kind of illegal softwares/bots etc).

If you guys have any idea, even a tiny hint I would be greatly appreciated.<ac_metadata title="Frequent connection errors in the beginning of the month"> </ac_metadata>
