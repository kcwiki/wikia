Imagine that you have a half-assed fleet (such a Level 130 Kongou, Level 99 Yamato and Akagi while everyone else is at level 30-50, with most DDs and CAs at Level 20 at most) and managed to do Spring 2015 event just fine before your fleet even reached that level, only for the Summer event is announced as an event that is exactly every bit-to-bit as hard as Operation AL/MI, complete with fleet locking and level-scaled difficulty.

To top it off, the second stage features night air battle node (=one-sided rape from Wo-class flagship since your carriers can't operate at night), and Shinano is a rare random drop in the E6, and the map is every bit as hard as the AL/MI Counterattack map.

What would be your reaction if this map becomes reality? Even if you have the fleet up for the job, would you still want her enough to do that hell map over and over?<ac_metadata title="What if the Manual Difficulty Selection is abolished in the next event?"> </ac_metadata>
