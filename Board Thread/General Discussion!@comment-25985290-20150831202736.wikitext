all I have right now is mutsu as BB and the rest FBB the kongou sisters that are leveled. What I am want to asking if I should give up on E-7 and just farm for the rest like Roma and Mizuho I don't think I have enough resources to do both. down to 225 buckets, and I can't even S rank the X and Y nodes. highest level ship is Hiei 91. Thank you for your opinion. <ac_metadata title="Event E-7 composition no Yamato, Musashi, Akitsumaru, or Nagato" lastmove="1452422362"> </ac_metadata>
