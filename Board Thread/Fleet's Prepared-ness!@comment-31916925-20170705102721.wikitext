About bluep, this month i'll make one before the event starts, by clearing 3-5 and 4-5 (i've done 1-5 and 2-5 already), but I don't know on who I have to use it ç_ç Ships in need of a bp Nagato, Suzuya, Kumano, <span style="font-weight:normal;">Chikuma, </span>Fusou sisters: i was thinking to give priority to Yamashiro, but I'd like a pro's advice.



About Shipgirls... I have 110 slots, and I cannot take more places before summer event.

Ignore Ikazuchi and Inazuma, as well as Aoba,  i keep them for a quest and i'll scrap them (poor lolis) before the event starts. Of all the trophy ships, I was thinking to scrap Uzuki and Fujinami (after giving her Kai) and even Minazuki and Tatsuta, if necessary (Of the 4 ships, Tatsuta is the one i want to keep the most, i quite like her). 

I'm not sure if keeping Z3 and Murakumo is actually worth. I would like to bring them to Kai ni, but maybe i should switch one of the 2 with Asashio and maybe Libeccio (if i manage to drp her of course). What do you think?

Atm i'm levelling Kawakaze, Jun'you, Chikuma, Yamashiro, Z1 and some subs.

Thanks to those who will answer and sorry again for bothering you...

Have a good game <3<ac_metadata title="Sorry for bothering, but I need help ç_ç"> </ac_metadata>
