I started playing around July but since I went on vacation on that time, I was poorly prepared for Summer Event and only barely managed to reach E-3. Since then I've dedicated some of my time to training my girls and I hope I'm able to conquer this Fall Event!

What do you think of my fleet? Should I focus on leveling some more girls? And what difficulty do you think my fleet will be able to handle? Sorry for any grammar mistakes english isn't my main language...

CV's/CVL's (btw if you're wondering why kaga is so low it's because I only got her a few days ago and am currently training her!)
