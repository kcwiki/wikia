It's that time again. Good thing also, because I had 500 points expiring by the end of the month.

This time, I went with just 5000 points. I live in the Euro Zone (god dammit ...), and thanks to our very wise and intelligent rulers (/sarcasm), the EUR:YEN exchange rate is at an all times low. About 1:117 today, when it was about 1:135 some months ago. I kind of remember the first time I hated my wallet it was about 1:140 or so, nearly 2 years ago.

First time, unlocked all 4 docks and expanded the base to 200 slots. Second time, expanded the base to 240 slots and bought 5 rings. This time, expanded the base to 250 slots, bought 6 rings and spent the last points on a furniture fairy.

Considering that there are about 170 shipgirls currently implemented, and I have them all, these slots should last me for a long time. As for the 6 rings, I have one or two candidates almost ready, the remaining rings will be put on reserve.<ac_metadata title="Wallet hating."> </ac_metadata>
