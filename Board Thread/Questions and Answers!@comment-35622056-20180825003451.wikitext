After the HTML5 Update alot of things changed I don't think I have to explain that to people that played more than a week before the HTML5 Update.

Point being is that it seems to me and to the opinion of alot of people (in the official Discord / Other Discords with Kancolle as its main topic and streamers.) are of the opinion that not everything is the best. most of the topics where about the very low EXP Vs the resources that are spend for this EXP.

My Current qwestion being is what are the opinions of other users on this point. and if people found the new 4-3 / 3-2a / 1-5.




Outside that some personal qwestions 

I would like to know what I need to do for B121 / And F78 Since there are no Requires listed in the qwest page.

My thanks for reading this.<ac_metadata title="Qwestions About the Current way to keep going after the HTML5 Update. (About The starving of EXP. (( the death of 4-3)) )"> </ac_metadata>
