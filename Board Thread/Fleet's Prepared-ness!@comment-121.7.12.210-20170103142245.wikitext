Hi,



I lost my API link 2 years ago so I took a break, got it to work on mobile last month so have been trying to catch up

I went on Jintsu's demon-training mode the last 5 weeks or so to try and get ready for the next event (my CAs are in a terrible neglected state, I do have ok DDs, CVs and ONE CVL...) but it has been a large drain on resource (not to mention extreme boredom from constant 3-2A...) I am HQ level 92, and went from the cap (32500) and im hovering about 17k on fuel and ammo last I checked.Â 



should i continue to train, or just exped and let it regen? my Expeds are not keeping up with my resource drain since i keep rotating the teams on 3-2A (basically at any time I have >40 ships red-faced). I have about 500 buckets so i don't think that would be an issue.

For reference, I can clear 1-5 and 4-5 but not the other extras due to branching rules. I recently cleared 5-2 but am still stuck on 5-3 (damn you night battle)<ac_metadata title="What to prioritize for preparing?"> </ac_metadata>
