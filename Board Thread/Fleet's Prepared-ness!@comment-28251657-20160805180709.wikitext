<p style="font-weight:normal;">Hey guys, this is my second event that I'm really trying for, I managed to pass the hell that is Spring '16 on Easy, but I'm wondering if I'm in any condition to do Medium+ for this smaller scale event. I plan on farming this event for any ships I still need (Ooyodo pls come home) and I think my rsc count is count. I have 30k+ on every resource except bauxite, which is still under softcap and I'm working on remedying that. It's at 19k for now. I have 1000+ buckets, no issue there for farming.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Anyways, here are the fleet pictures.[[File:Showcase_Ships.png|thumb|400px|Showcase]][[File:Showcase_Gear.png|thumb|400px|Showcase Equipment]][[File:DD_List.png|thumb|400px|List of DDs]]</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">I added the DD list because that would be my main issue for shiplocking. In addition I'm worried about the ASW capabilities of my girls. I have enough of the large ships ready for them and Isuzu has worked wonders in 1-5, I'm training Yuubari to do the same but my DDs are lacking in that area. In addition I should have one more BP soon so I was wondering where I should devote it to. I can use it on either Chikuma or Yamashiro but I'm conflicted.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">I have several AP shells and 35.6cms upgraded but that's about it.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">I'm currently grinding Furutaka, Ashigara, Souryuu, Yamashiro, Ayanami, U-511, and Yuubari in my training fleet while the other 3 fleets are doing their best to get more resources.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">I'll answer any questions and respond to anyone so thanks in advance fellow Admirals!</p><ac_metadata title="Fleet Check and Difficulty Selection Help"> </ac_metadata>
