Short question, for those who didn't manage to get Teruzuki chan, who do you blame for that?

1. Yourself, for not being well prepared enough. (Either in terms of the girls lvl/ equipment or the resources, or time management.)

2. Tanaka or the devs, for thing out a map with Wo-K FS for 2 nodes at pre-bosses, or even worse, dyson.

3. Tanaka or the devs, for making a map with no(t figured out) difinite branching rules, and insanely hard enemies.

4. RNG

5. Teruzuki chan herself, for her being E-7 reward (or as my friend says "Playing hard to get" bitch.)

I still argue with my said friend till today, since he refuse to stop badmouthing- Teru-chan, cause he couldn't get her. Yep, he blames Teru-chan Â like in the 5th choice and he's sworn that once he get her (if he ever does), he'll equip her with damecon, and deploy her to 5-5 just to sink her as a punishment and a revenge for being what so-called "Hard to get bitch"<ac_metadata title="Who will you blame event mishap?"> </ac_metadata>
