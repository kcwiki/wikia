Just wondering if maybe for the next event the front page poll for favourite new girl shouldn't include the Abyssals (or, at least reskin versions).
I mention because this looking at the recent one the clear winner is the re-coloured of Cruiser Tsu, and to be presumptious here I doubt that most people actually consider a pre-existing enemy painted a new colour as their fave, and I suspect someone may have repeatedly voted for a laugh.<ac_metadata title="Event ship Poll change?"> </ac_metadata>
