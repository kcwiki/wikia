There seems to be some errors regarding quest B25 'Sortie the New 2nd Carrier Division'[[File:5-2_quest.jpg|thumb]]

Thought that it might be due to me never completing 5-2 before(as in killing the boss in it) so ran it another few more times, but even after i killed the boss and ran it one more time it still isn't complete.

Is there some special DD i need to take note of for this quest? or some ship that i shouldn't bring for the 2 extras?
