This is kinda annoying, I mean it. Sometimes I leave chrome open but whenever blackout occur (which is rare but it did happen a lot now for some reason), whole game data cache got wiped and I have no choice but to download it again.

This is probably not a problem for teikoku with fast bandwidth but since I got stuck with slow bandwidth temporarily, this takes a hefty time to reload them all back.

For my question, is there a way for the sudden shutdown to not wiped the game cache? I'm using chrome for kancolle only while other stuff are on firefox. Thanks in advance<ac_metadata title="Sudden shutdown caused cache wipe and need to re-download whole game data"> </ac_metadata>
