Every time my game tries to load Chiyoda (basic non-Kai version)'s artwork, my game froze. Does anyone else ever have this happen to them?




I have a basic Chiyoda and a Chiyoda Kou Kai Ni. My game can load the latter fine, but when it tries to load the former in any way (even in library), it stops working, and I can right click on the game to find a "Movie not loaded..." message alongside an option to update and read more on Flash.




It doesn't look like it's the fault of that particular Chiyoda as my game freezes when I get a Chiyoda drop in general. It doesn't seem to be an issue with my account either as a friend of mine can view my Chiyoda fine through his computer (different PC, different connection) so it might be my PC and/or my connection. I've so far tried the following:




1. Clear browsing history in full including image cache

2. Reinstall Chrome and Flash

3. Delete some Flash files for a clean uninstall

4. Restart wifi adapter and router

5. Play without kc3kai

6. Reinstall kc3kai

7. Wait on the freeze for hours




None of these worked. I tried playing in incognito but DMM wouldn't let me. Do I need to reinstall my OS at this rate? Anyone has any idea what's going on?<ac_metadata title="chiyoda freezing the game"> </ac_metadata>
