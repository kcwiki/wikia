Hello Guys!

first im very thankful for this wiki and all information about this game.

But I have some beginner questions.

1) Whats the difference between a Type 0 Observation Seaplane and Zuiun? I read the Zuiun can bomb submarines but it have the same characteristics like the observation seaplane (artillery spotting for example), so I can replace all my Type 0 Observation Seaplane with Zuiun on my BB. Is that correct?

2) I have no idea how I should Kai or Kai Ni my planes or weapons. I read for 2-4 I should have 4 BB and 2 CV to clear this. Well, I have 3 BB, 1 BBV, 1 FBB and 1 CV at this moment in my main fleet. I read I should have the Kai Ni version of Ryuusei for example. But I dont understand how I should improve my planes (and equipment). It have something to do with Akashis Improvement Arsenal?

3) What is the recommended Level for World 2-4 and beyond? The highest Ship in my fleet is Yuudachi Kai Level 23. My HQ is Level 23. Well here is my fleet (for some reasons, I cant use hyperlink). I created a tinyurl. Here is the preview-Url:

(I really want to know how you post your fleet in a excel table or something like this like other peoples)

Thank you!<ac_metadata title="some beginner questions"> </ac_metadata>
