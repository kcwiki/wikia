So I started playing just a week ago but I'm kind of stumped on fleet compositions. Finding 2-4 hard to beat. This is what I have currently. 




CVL: Hosho, Hiyou, Shouhou, Ryuujou

BBV: Ise Kai 

Fast BB: Hiei 

BB: Yamashiro 

CA: Takao, Atago, Ashigara, Chikuma, Mogami 

DD: Too many to name but most of them are underleveled except for Fubuki 




Beginner tips would be appreciated too >-< thanks in advance <ac_metadata title="Fleet Composition for noobs + Good CV recipes and drop locations?"> </ac_metadata>
