Hey guys!

As the title says. I own only 1 print at the moment and won't get another one until after the event probably. I don't have any CVB, but own Mogami, Suzy and Kumano. Of course if I leveled one of the Cranes to Kai Ni, I'd push it all the way to their A form. The catapult will be here on Tuesday too. So the question is, which of them should take prio before the event? Or maybe it's Fusou, despite having Yamashiro Kai Ni?

Thanks in advance, have a dancing Kido Butai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ure7pGkbyUc<ac_metadata title="Tone-class vs Cranes, who to Kai Ni first?"> </ac_metadata>
