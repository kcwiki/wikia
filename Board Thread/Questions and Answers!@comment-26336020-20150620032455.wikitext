It's fine if I might be overlooking a page or you can scream and yell at me to lurk moar... but does anyone have a page or is there a link for a list of ships and when they were released?  I've just become curious over time about when exactly were ships brought to the game.  I believe someone also had a list of the order of kai-2'd ships iirc.<ac_metadata title="Quick question about ship release dates..."> </ac_metadata>
