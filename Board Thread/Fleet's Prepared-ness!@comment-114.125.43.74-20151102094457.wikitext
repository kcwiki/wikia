i need some advice on upcoming event

this is my fleet : http://i.imgur.com/xTWYN3M.png

these are my equips : http://i.imgur.com/fqc4dih.png

these are my resources: http://i.imgur.com/zFdeSJY.png

my improved equips(?) : 41cm*1 x3, 12.7cm B*1 x2, 35.6cm*2 x3 , 35.6cm*3 x2, 35.6cm*4 x3, quad torp*3 x2, type 91 ap*1 x2, and a type 91 ap*2

imp. mats 26

1. my goals are to at least getting a bp on event and the best will be getting a first class medal(might as well ditch the idea of getting a bp)

or these goals are too much for me right now?  what did i miss in leveling? what can i improve from this?

2. i have a bp, who should i give it to?(choukai, roma, or ...)

in my opinion, i need skilled lookout and that radar from choukai but roma's evasion is horrible pre-kai

anyone better than these two and the reason why?

im prepared for the salt on the advices XD

this event may be my last event before i get busy and cant play anymore for months so i dont want to regret anything .-.

any advices are welcome...

thanks for your time~<ac_metadata title="advice on upcoming event"> </ac_metadata>
