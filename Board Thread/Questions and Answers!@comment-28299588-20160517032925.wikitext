I was wondering what shipgirls would you guys like to see in the game? I would love to see ships such as Enterprise, Johnston, Arizona, and maybe Indianapolis for the USA. Wouldn't mind Hood and Prince of Wales for the UK. Maybe Tirpitz and some more U-boats and destroyers for Germany. Definitely want to see Yamakaze so that way the Shiratsuyu-class will be completed.<ac_metadata title="What shipgirls do you think should be added to the game?"> </ac_metadata>
