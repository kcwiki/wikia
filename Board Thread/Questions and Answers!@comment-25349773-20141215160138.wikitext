I'm just wondering, are there any good maps for leveling CAs? I'm met with the problem where I have a good number of high level DDs, CLs, BBs, BBVs, CVLs, and CVs but only a few high level CAs with most CAs at level 1. I want to level them up for the upcoming event but can't seem to find a good enough map to sortie them on. please help!<ac_metadata title="Leveling CAs"> </ac_metadata>
