Thanks for sparing some of your time for this. I've already made an account and successfully played the game, but lately I'm getting the Cat Error after the game start. I've tried clearing cache and putting cookies through the console, getting the API and opening it in a launcher, using extensions for Chrome (KC3 Kai and Kancolle Launcher) but nothing seems to work. I don't really know what to do anymore.

Thanks in advance<ac_metadata title="Cat Error after game start"> </ac_metadata>
