Im with Hatsuyuki.... Im a lazy, self-proclaimed shut-in who only go outside my room when going to school, or forced to. If possible, I dont want to go outside at all, and continue my repeating cycle of play, eat and sleep.<ac_metadata title="Who is the shipgirl whose personality is closest to your own?"> </ac_metadata>
