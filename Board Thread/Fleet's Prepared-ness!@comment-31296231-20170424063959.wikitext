I started early this year and couldn't finish Winter event due to lacking the necessary ships so I have been busting my balls grinding hoping that wouldn't happen again. I have 98k fuel, 73k ammo, 70k steel, 62k bauxite. Any advice would be appreciated[[File:F9c5aad3-c781-40e9-9fb2-db0b60785e95.jpg|thumb]][[File:1db29baa-7a6c-4b8a-b4af-dbb0d106de4b.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Hoping to farm easy/medium."> </ac_metadata>
