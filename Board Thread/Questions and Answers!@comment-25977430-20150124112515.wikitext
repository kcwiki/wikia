setting getting 4 fleets as my primary early goal in the game, i went out for farming and crafting.

I only needed Hiei to get my fourth fleet,

.... for me Hiei is THE rarest ship in Kancolle!

over the time i got 10+ Kongous, 10+ Harunas, 20+ Kirishimas!

i spend my mats in LSC (getting kirishimas 90% of the time)



curiously enough, ships that will never drop (for a month now) are the ships i need to finish quests (even beside this main, most important quest)

- i got Ise -> Hyuuga never drops (got 25+ Yamashiros over the time)

-i got Akagi -> Kaga never drops

- i got Zuikaku, Shoukaku never drops (ok, as i understand, ths one is considered to be rare)

Taken into account the number of times i sortied in 3-1, 4-1, and especially 3-2, no matter how random it is, any of these 3 ships should have dropped long time ago. i mean,

is Hiei really so incredibly rare ship?

do these FBB drop more often after lvl80? or i can expect continuation of this endless grind for getting my 4th fleet?

I have gone so far to farm with fleet composition consisting of ships RL Hiei fought with in formation, or to farm with the other 3 sisters, but to no avail...

Am i doing something wrong?
