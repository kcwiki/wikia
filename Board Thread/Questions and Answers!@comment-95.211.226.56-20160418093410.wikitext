So I've been using KC3Kai to play Kancolle, and after the last maintenance, I've been getting catbombs with a rather alarming frequency (most of them happened while changing fleet's members or shipgirl's equipment).



Has anyone else using KC3 been having the same problem? I've tried purging my browser's cache, and tried different way to play (usually by 'play via DMM website' rather than API link), and the problem persists.Â <ac_metadata title="KC3 - a lot of catbombs"> </ac_metadata>
