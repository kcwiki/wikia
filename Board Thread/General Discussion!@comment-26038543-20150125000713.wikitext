so I just got in the game like this morning and I have a few questions please help me.

1- how do the maps work? I know that the types of ships you bring could change your direction. but specifically how does it work? I am currenly on the 1-2 and I keep going south while the boss is east. my current fleet has 2 light cruisers and 4 destroyers. and does the flagship matter too?

2- according to the wiki, a lot of people are using API links. it says using this would go directly to your account. does this mean you don't have to go through the proxy connection (VPN) everytime you play? and how safe is this? I know the site says it is safe but I saw some posts about people having problems with their API links. If I still use the old way to connect it is stil fine right?

3- I notice that some light cruisers have planes, but they don't seem to do anything. in the anime I see that those planes are used for scouting. but in the game what are those planes for?

thank you very much to anyone who helps :)<ac_metadata title="some questions from new player"> </ac_metadata>
