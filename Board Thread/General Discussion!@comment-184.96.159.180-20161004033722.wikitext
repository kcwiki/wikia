I use Kancolle Command Center on Chrome to access my Kancolle game.  Starting last week, I keep getting a notice telling me to enroll through Nutaku to play Kancolle.

I did this, but Kancolle does not appear to exist on Nutaku.  Worse, I can't get back to my game, since I always get stopped at the notice telling me that I must use Nutaku.

How can i get back to my game?<ac_metadata title="Nutaku messing with my access"> </ac_metadata>
