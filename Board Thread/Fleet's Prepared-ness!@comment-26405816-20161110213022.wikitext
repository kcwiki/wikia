I was very busy lately and sadly I could not powerlevel many shipgirls, my main goals were to train Warspite, Akizuki, Unryuu and get Fubuki to Kai Ni, which I could manage somehow; but my DDs and CVLs don't seem that prepared. (In case of shiplocking if I choose Medium)

But I'm most worried about my resources: 51k Fuel, 69k Ammo, 49k Steel and 28k Bauxite; also 202 Buckets.

DDs that don't appear on the Showcase: Fubuki (Lv. 70), Shimakaze (Lv. 69), Akizuki (Lv. 67), Yukikaze (Lv. 64), Ushio (Lv. 63), Amatsukaze (Lv. 60), Murasame&Shiratsuyu (both Lv. 52) and that's all for possible candidates in the event. The only CL that's not on the Showcase is Tatsuta (Lv. 75) As for CVs, Aquila (Lv. 42) which I did not pay much attention (needed to Lv. up Unryuu). 

Right now I'm focused on stockpiling resources, I don't know if I should start powerleveling again.

And also, for equipment I think I'm alright, maybe I can craft 1-2 Suisei Model 12A + other planes (I'm not a fond of crafting planes sadly). I think 4 Type 91 Armor Piercing Shells are enough (also 6 x Sanshiki); some of the equipment information is not right so I have 3 Saiun, 2 x 38.1 cm Mk.I... and I think that's it. 

Do I have to do something else? If so please tell me what you think. Thank you.<ac_metadata title="Is my fleet ready for all-Easy? (Maybe with a mix of Medium)"> </ac_metadata>
