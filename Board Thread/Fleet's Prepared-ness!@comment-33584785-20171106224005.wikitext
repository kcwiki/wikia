here are all my girls as of right now... i've only been playing casually for a few months (HQ 82), and haven't put much thought into levelling etc and had been sticking to my favs until recently (as you might be able to tell lol). edited to include equipment but it's all horribly basic

i think what i'd like to know is: who should i prioritize levelling/getting to k2 in time? my fleet's seriously all over the place and thoughts/advice would be really appreciated lol. thanks![[File:71e25210-a317-4a2d-af8c-0108a0c67cf7.png|thumb]][[File:D818792c-3ea0-4b7b-a729-c471432a70e1.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="fall 2017 first event... will i survive?"> </ac_metadata>
