I think I posted it in the wrong subforum before. I noticed that the infoboxes on ships' pages are put there mostly via ShipInfoKai template and modules, but on several pages it's typed in the article and a template like Shipinfo is used. I assume the former is the correct way, am I right? I changed some of the articles (mostly pertaining to my shipgirls) so that all of them have it the same way. I also changed the formatting to HTML div tag in the pages using the other method (MediaWiki tables). If the remodeled version of a ship has different name, should I use in the ShipInfoKai template the new name (e.g. Italia/), the basic name with "Kai" suffix (e.g. Littorio/Kai) or it doesn't matter? I know it doesn't from the technical point of view, as Littorio/Kai links to Italia in the module, but is there some standard for it? I think it should be standardized, but it's not VERY important.<ac_metadata title="Ship Infobox Template"> </ac_metadata>
