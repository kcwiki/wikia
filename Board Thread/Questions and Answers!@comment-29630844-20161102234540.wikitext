Hey teitoku! *bad impersonation of One True Goddesu*

So, last week I've cleared 3-5 for the first time. Decided to go with CAV CL 4DD, got 3 kills this way, but then the reroutes began and had to finish with a heavy fleet (surprisingly easy). Taught by past mistakes and hoping for a cheaper clear than north route, I decided to go with CL+5DD combo:

Took my best combat DDs minus Hibiki, who's currently earning her upkeep in expeditions. Sparkled them all to 85 morale as we[[File:Hitagi35results.png|thumb]]ll. Results can be seen to the right.

No, I didn't retreat in the first node for fun. Got to the boss 3 times, failed to sink it once. Total 16 runs, some 30 buckets wasted and 6 shipfu waiting for their turn to dock. Opted for heavy fleet, similar levels (97 Akagi, 76 Kaga, 85 Kongou, 72 Choukai, 72 Ashigara, 80 Maya). 2 runs, 2 kills, 6 buckets used. No sparkling whatsoever.

Equipment on my DDs varied (usual 2*15.2cm main + Ko-Hyoteki on Abukuma), from 4 equipped with night battle CI (Lookouts on Poi and Asashio) to 3 with double attack setup (2 guns + radar).

Obviously using +10 torpedoes and Kai or at least +7 normal 12.7cm main guns.

Worth noting that I hit HQ level 100 yesterday.

Now the question is: does RNG hate my destroyers (had 1 taiha'd ship in every 1-6 run this month!), or am I an idiot doing something wrong? I'd prefer the latter tbh. 

Thanks in advance and have a halloween Poi in return: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G4Vv98hY2Q<ac_metadata title="3-5 South route problems"> </ac_metadata>
