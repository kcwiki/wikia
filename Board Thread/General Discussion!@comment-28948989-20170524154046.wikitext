So... about the "Akashi-list.me" site or "Simplified Chart for Akashi" just how accurate is this site? How badly is it outdated? I'm talking about both the datas of the old improvements and the lack of newer ones. If it's not really a good idea to follow it anymore, is there a similar site that is a bit more precise and updated?<ac_metadata title="Akashi improvement site, Akashi-list.me"> </ac_metadata>
