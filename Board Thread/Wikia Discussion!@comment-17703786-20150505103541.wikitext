Something of a small nitpick of mine after noticing the translations of the Hourly Lines for most of the ship girls is that many of the lines denote "AM" or "PM" in the lines accompanying the times. I think doing so is kind of silly not only because the lines themselves don't make any such distinction in Japanese (from what I hear), but also because the entire point of the 24-Hour clock system is to eliminate the AM and PM notations in the first place: Saying "13:00 hours" already implies that it is 1:00 in the afternoon without the need for a notation, and as such adding AM and PM would be redundant.<ac_metadata title="About the Hourly Line translations"> </ac_metadata>
