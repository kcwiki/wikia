I used to live in japan so it wasn't a problem because I can buy it straight from real stores. However, I have just moved to Korea and now I find myself not able to buy one.

Is there a way to buy dmm point, webmoney or bitcash in Korea without credit card? 

Thanks.<ac_metadata title="Is there a way to buy dmm point in Korea without credit card?"> </ac_metadata>
