Excuse me, this fall event is my second event, and last event I cleared all the map but unfortunately I failed to get Prototype Flight Deck because I choose easy on e-6 (because of my resources and the remaining time). So to prevent something like that, I want to prepare my fleet for the next event. My current HQ level is 99. This is my Fleet Condition

My current resources is 26k/26k/41k/23k and 314 buckets. Is there any advice for this fleet ?<ac_metadata title="Can I finish this event with med mix hard diff with this fleet?"> </ac_metadata>
