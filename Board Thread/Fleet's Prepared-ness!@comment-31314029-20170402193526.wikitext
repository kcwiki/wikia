Hey. I´ve seen how was last year ´s Spring, and holy crap with that E-7. Based on that I lowered my objective to clearing the event on Easy with a couple of medium here and there (depending on drops). anyway RL will hit me hard this month and i´ll pretty much leave my fleet in autopilot except on weekends, so no power leveling and just some stockpiling. I think that my girls are ready for that, but I´m asking you guys, just in case, if I´m missing something. anyway the girls:

[[File:2017-04-03_Ship_List.png|thumb|400px]]The idea is to level makigumo to 40, all CVs to 50 on weekends and level Takao, Maya, Hiei and Kirishima as much as posible on PvPs (a month of that with kashima must be enough to put them near lvl 75)

anything else that I´m lacking?

Now as for res and equip:

[[File:Eqpjf.png|thumb|400px]]I will use kashima once per day to arm quadruples torps + 4 ( 4 of them, I6 days) and 35.6 cm guns (other days)



as for res I´m aiming for 350 buckets and 50/50/35/35 on res.

What do you think? Good for Ez/ some med farming?<ac_metadata title="am I missing something?"> </ac_metadata>
