It's been bugging me for a while now but let's say you're a new player (or old players I don't know), what do you expect as an answer when you asked:

"How hard is the event?" 

Or any derivative of the question.

I always think of the worst possible situation (aka "it could be worse") so I'm not sure how to tackle this. <ac_metadata title="The constantly repeated question and why?"> </ac_metadata>
