Is that reward gun worth the salt if I have 4 Iowa gun already (I don't plan to upgrade them to GFCS) for my BBs?
I have enough res. (200k+) and buckets (2k+), but I don't want to waste it, coz I might don't have time in the near future to recover all :S<ac_metadata title="(Early Fall 2018 E5 normal) Should I go for it with my fleet?"> </ac_metadata>
