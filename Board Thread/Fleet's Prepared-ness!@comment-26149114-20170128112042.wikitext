i heard that the upcoming event will be a small one and im wondering if i can finish allhard with just my rsc a little above the soft cap(26k).. (have my pre-internship until march thus i dont have time to stockpile T_T..) my time's just enough for leeching exp from pvp and sortieing 12hour+ expeditions.. i just want that first-class medal badly.. also if there are any news about what campaign will it be based on so i can prepare ships in advance whenever i have my free time.. 

here's my ship list  http://i.imgur.com/z9g5UwL.jpg

hope both helps..<ac_metadata title="winter event all hard/hard-normal mix with soft cap resources.."> </ac_metadata>
