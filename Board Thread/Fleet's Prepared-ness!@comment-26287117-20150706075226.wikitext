Need a tips and feedback from any player. Veteran's feedback would be nice.

I wanna finish at least Medium.

I heard that summer event is about Cv/Cvls so started leveling them up. I have a 2 weeks break so imma go nutz. i will level 3 Cv in 60 or k2 in 3 days and will k2 4 CA in 3 days. extra DD and Cl leveling in 3-4 days. I'm gonna do a leveling if I reach my goal and still have extra time in 2 weeks.
