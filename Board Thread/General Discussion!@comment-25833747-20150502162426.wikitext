I received an iBook G4 for several weeks ago and upgraded to 10.5.8 that coming with Safari 5.0.6 and Flash Player 10. I curious that it can play kancolle on this computer.

Is it a good idea to try it out and play like normal pc? Hope the server will not classified as playing on mobile. I worried about it.<ac_metadata title="PowerPC + Kancolle = Trouble?"> </ac_metadata>
