Watching the first waifu poll made me think about who to ring first.

When I started playing, I wanted Yamato. However, since then, Some issues popped up which made second guess.

First is that I don't have her yet. My first Yamato class is Musashi. So far, Yamato class usefulness has been a mixed bag for me. The lack of slots also makes me reconsider crafting her.

Second is that I like her design, but coincidentally, that very long brown intake ponytail type of character has been frequently slut-ified, ever since Belldandy.

Third is that she is called Yamato, another name of Japan. We all love anime culture, but there are more reasons to be concerned about the country than its historical involvement in WWII.

I have 11 lv 99 ships, and many more near 99. But I haven't ringed anyone so far. They are Kongou class, submarines, CLT duo, Fusou, and Kaga. Bismarck is 98. I may need to get overÂ  Yamato issues before choosing anyone.<ac_metadata title="Need some help deciding who to ring first."> </ac_metadata>
