Hey guys!
First time seriously attempting to top 500.

Currently I'm in 274th with 1923 points. Is there any risk of me being thrown down until the ranking cut-off, with me only doing expeditions until then? 
Like, please give me a certanty or your personal experience.

Notes: Currently, the 501 has 1622 points and I'm in Ominato Keibi fu.<ac_metadata title="About Montly Ranking, top 500."> </ac_metadata>
