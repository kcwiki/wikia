Can someone help me? i got some problem when purchasing item in akashi shop.

i will summarize the problem:

- today, i buy 2000 DMM point and redeem it. there nothing wrong so far..

- next, i'm purchasing dock extension key in akashi shop. when i'm bought it, it's just like normal ( my DMM point decreases to 1000 means i've already buy it) so i continue to purchase 10 Extra slot kanmusu to spend all of my DMMP

- But, when i'm check it on the item list... none of the item that i purchased is in there.

i lost 2000 yen just for nothing...
