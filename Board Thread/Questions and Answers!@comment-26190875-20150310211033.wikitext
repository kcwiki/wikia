Yesterday I won the lotery to enter the game, but I had college today so I shut my computer down and when I got back I set it up like I did the other day but it will not let me enter just like before I did not enter the lottery. It is only showing full servers, but yesterday I connected to one. Does any one have any solutions please.<ac_metadata title="Won the lottery but the next day can not connect"> </ac_metadata>
