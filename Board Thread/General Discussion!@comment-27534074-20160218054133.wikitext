Well .. i guess it's sounds weird but , somehow i feel like i want to study more about this game. i feel like there is something that i still have to know in this game . . for example , that calculations about damage , and then there is like what kind equipment to use. i've been playing this game almost a year . .  but i feel like there isn't any progress . . like , when i want to join the event , sometimes i don't fullfill the criteria. 

Is there any advice where should i start studying or maybe from your experience 

and i'm sorry if my english grammar is off and my topics is weird ;_;)<ac_metadata title="I want to study . ."> </ac_metadata>
