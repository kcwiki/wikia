Hello everyone, I need some advice on my fleet and equipment. Im not very confident since I got rekt on last Event (which is really scary and gave me a trauma ;-; ), but I still manage to clear it. Not sure how my fleet is gonna work on event, what ship type is lacking, what equipment should I build more, and who should i level up more? Gonna go all Hard (frontlining if possible)

-Waiting for next month's EO reset so I can get BP for Abukuma, probably the next BP is for Yamashiro

-I cant upgrade my equipment since i dont have Akashi yet. Is it necessary to hunt her before event? If yes, what is the fastest way to get her? And just in case I got her, what equipment should i upgrade first? since my screws are piling up.

Tips and advice would be appriciated :) Thank you<ac_metadata title="Need some Advice on my Fleet and Equipments"> </ac_metadata>
