I started playing Kancolle towards the end of the Summer event, so this will be my first major event. I'm planning on going easy for this event because I know that in curtain areas I'm lacking ships that I need more of, like CVs and SSs. What I would like to know:

1) How much difficulty will I have on easy in this event?

2) Should I be more focused on trying to clear this event or building up my fleet?

My resources are currently at: 57,808 fuel, 56,528 ammo, 80,737 steel, 52,119 bauxite, and 516 buckets. My current fleet and equipment can be found here: http://imgur.com/a/xJgZg<ac_metadata title="First Event: Clear on Easy or Farm?"> </ac_metadata>
