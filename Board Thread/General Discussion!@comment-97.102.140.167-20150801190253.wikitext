I just got Nagato out of the construction yard, however the picure didn't show up. Just the very colorful background. I still got the ship though. It also happens with other ships as well, not all the time though. Just the bigger ships: BB, CA,CVs, and sometimes DDs. Anyone know how to fix this?<ac_metadata title="Ship picture not showing up on reward screen."> </ac_metadata>
