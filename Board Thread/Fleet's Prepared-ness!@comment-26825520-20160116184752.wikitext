I got my first First-Class Medal last event... which probably isn't much, with the map's difficulty supposedly flipped around. Will also require help on weapon modernizing. Would also appreciate help on deciding on my ships; 92 locked ships leaves little room to breathe in. My event goals are Akizuki, Harusame, Yuu, Amagi, and the rewarded ships.Outside the event is just Bismarck and Shioi.

My upgraded equips are as follows:

12.7cm: 1 1* | 1 3* | 1 5* | 1 8*| 2 10*

20.3cm no.2: 2 4*

381mm/50: 1 1* | 1 5*

<span style="font-weight:normal;">381mm/50 Kai: 1 3*</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">41cm: 1 2*</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">35.6cm: 1 1* | 3 4*</span>

61cm Quint Torp: 1 4*

T91 AP: 5 5* 

As for resources, I plan on having at least 150k of each resources, or less. And around 500 or so buckets. Currently at 30k most of my rsc, and 325 buckets. EOs done for the month. Next month's BP are on Roma (because Choukai is still far away from her K2 level)
