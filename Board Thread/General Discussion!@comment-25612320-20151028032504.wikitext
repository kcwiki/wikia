Hello fellow TTK! I've been encouraged to post this up in the discussion forum as well. I'm making vinyl decals for putting on computers / cars / anything with a smooth flat surface (and no that's not an RJ joke).

I just launched the site a few days ago, and my first production run of stickers is Kancolle's Taiha / Chuuha / Shouha icons, and I wanted to share it with the wiki!~ I'm also going to be making "Poi" (both hiragana and romaji) to stick places, but right now those are just in the prototype phase. Also, I do custom requests and so if you've got a great idea for something, I'd love to hear it!Â  Check it out at [http://vodnik-decals.com vodnik-decals.com] ![[File:DSC_2907c.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Stickers from vodnik-decals.com]]

(And yes, I've gotten feedback on doing some of the wiki chat emotes like the "pregnant" one and I can do them, just need a good high resolution source and some time to develop it! I've also had the idea for a KTKM crit torpedo or something along those lines. Don't be shy, toss those ideas out there! Keep in mind though that super tiny details and multiple colors are more for printed stickers, not die-cut vinyl like mine.)  <ac_metadata title="Anyone interested in KanColle Stickers?"> </ac_metadata>
