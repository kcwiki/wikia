Exactly what it says on the tin. I have all the FBBs featured in Kancolle (and no, Roma wasn't handed to me, I have earned her), and my fleet are decently raised since my last event, with 5 heavy cruisers (Myoukou sisters and Maya) and both dragon sisters (Souryuu and Hiryuu) at Kai Ni.

...except for one small trouble: Bismarck was the last FBB I've obtained, so I'm scrambling to level her up even in the midst of the Bisko-Fusou-Crane sister trilemma. What's more, all of my Kongou-class sisters are sitting at Level 70, and the next 10 level could take awhile to get, even with 5-4.

Apart from those, in my backlogs are two light carriers, 4 destroyers, crane sisters, Fusou and Tone-class cruisers and Choukai. Also, I'm sitting at around 15k ammo and 11k bauxite atm.<ac_metadata title="Should I keep leveling my fast battleships?"> </ac_metadata>
