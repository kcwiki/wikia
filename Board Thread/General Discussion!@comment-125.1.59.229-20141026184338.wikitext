Sitting ducks here is not going to get us nowhere, isnt it better to ask the devs straight away if such things such as API link and cookie region edit is allowed.

devs are very active on twitter so was wondering if anyone could ask. We might all end up getting banned one day once they announce api link is bypassing the server without having to login so its better safe than sorry. <ac_metadata title="Can someone ask the devs on twitter or something to ask if API link is Okay with them?" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
