Anyone played the new DMM Game To Love-ru Darkness Idol Revolution? Started it yesterday, biggest problem is that I dont know what to do to complete the Quests, there is a eng wiki, but it is mainly empty right now, if anyone has a ap wiki that could possible help, because of Atlas + copy and paste.

And any informations and opinons on the game are welcome, too<ac_metadata title="To Love-ru Idol Revolution"> </ac_metadata>
