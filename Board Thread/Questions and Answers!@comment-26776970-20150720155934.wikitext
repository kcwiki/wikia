[[File:BadConnection.jpg|thumb]]So recently I've came up to this problem. As the screenshot says, the translation coulnd't load because of bad connection. But I call this nonsense, my connection works perfectly fine.

I've tried reseting my API link which I did recently, clearing the programs cache and reseting the viewer itself.Â <span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;line-height:normal;">Logging in still works on DMM and both KC3 too. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;line-height:normal;">So what could be the problem with this?</span>

<span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;line-height:normal;">Thank you.</span><ac_metadata title="KancolleTool Problem: Couldn&#039;t load translation"> </ac_metadata>
