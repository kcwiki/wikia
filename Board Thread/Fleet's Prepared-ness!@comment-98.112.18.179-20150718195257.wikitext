Hello, Thanks for taking a look ahead of time. I was hoping to do the event on Hard if possible. This is my second event and the previous event I was only able to do it on Easy/Medium.Â  I have 30k of all resources saved up at this time and 400 buckets. So I'm torn between trying to get as many ships Kai Ni as possible or saving resources. I don't have any more blueprints left but I should be able to get 1 more in August. I think I'm good on Equipment at least.

Are they any ships you think I should be leveling or should I just save up for now till the event?
