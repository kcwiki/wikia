Hello everyone,

<span style="font-weight:normal;">I would like to know if I'm able to clear 5-1 with what I have at the moment. If I'm unable to finish B44 this week, it would mean having to do Bw6/8/9 again...</span>

This is my current B44 fleet with stats:[[File:B44_fleet.png|left]]









As you can see, my Nagara is only lv28 with 51 evasion. I see that a lv71 Nagara has 67 evasion. Would it be necessary to give her 43 more levels for 16 more evasion? The same question goes for Inazuma and Ikazuchi. Would the 10+ evasion bonus have a great impact, or would RNG have a larger impact?

I really don't like 4-3 grinding (traumatic experience), but I'm willing to grind 4-3 or 3-2A if necessary.

I'm thinking using a full surface combat setup, which basically means an automatic fail if I get that 1/3 sub formation:

[[File:B44_gear.png|thumb|left|400px]]Kirishima has an upgraded Dazzle, all six 10cm guns have FD, and everything except the 15m, FuMO and engines have been improved at least once.



I can replace the engines with a T4 and T3 sonar, but I don't think it would be enough to finish that Ka class FS if I were to go line ahead. (the DD may already be chuuha/taiha by the time they attack)

Should I use any yasen gear?

I'll definitely use node support, but I'm not sure about boss support.

I'll also be sparkling the light ships to 85, but should I sparkle the FBB as well?



Resources shouldn't be a concern (200k+ fuel/ammo and nearly 1992 buckets)

All thoughts/suggestions are welcome, and thanks in advance!!<ac_metadata title="Is my fleet ready for B44?"> </ac_metadata>
