So its almost the end of June now and im working steadily to improve my fleet. I have a pretty good idea of which ships to level up but i wanted to ask is there any ships that i have that i missed.

My current goals are to get Hiryuu and Souryuu to 77 and 78 for their Kai Ni's followed by the Myoukou class cruisers. 

For DD's im in the processing of getting Kasumi, Satsuki, Akatsuki, Shigure, Murasame, Michishio, Urakaze, Kagerou and Fumizuki to their Kai Ni's. <ac_metadata title="Fleet prep for next event"> </ac_metadata>
