Hey there, I'm quite new here (started out in March) and the upcoming event is going to be my first. I would like to be able to complete the event on Medium, however, as I'm not completely confident with all the additional mechanics involved, I'm seeking advice from more experienced players.

Currently I'm focusing on grinding 3-2A with Fusou and Yamashiro while my CVL and CA (Myoukou; Ashigara's up next in line) escorts leech experience. When it comes to CVL, I could Kai Ni Chitose and Chiyoda right now, I chose not to do so to save a little bit on consumption. Getting Ryuujou and Jun'you up to Kai Ni shouldn't be a problem if it were to become a priority, same for Souryuu and my other CVs.

Expedition-wise, during the day I'm running 2-5-21 + Tokyo Express for the weekly quests and 21-11-12 overnight.

Resources: 58k / 64k / 42k / 34k, 722 buckets, 2 medals. I could get 2 additional medals at the beginning of May for a new Blueprint.

Thank you all in advance, any input would be greatly appreciated![[File:B9e47b6b-853e-401e-8e08-4a43bf0cf780.jpg|thumb]][[File:58ade798-8453-4312-871f-a1c36e2917ca.jpg|thumb]][[File:1492966296852.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Spring 2017 - Easy or maybe Medium difficulty?
