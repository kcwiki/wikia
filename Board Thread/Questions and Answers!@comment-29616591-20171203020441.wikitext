<p style="font-weight:400;">So i want to craft holo radars, mainly type 33/32 (type 14 only if RNG allows it). Been playing for almost 2 years and i don't have any of them until 1 lucky attempt today.</p>

<p style="font-weight:400;">The question is, ideally, how many one should have them in their fleet? assuming that i have the slot to keep them. For now i'm thinking to get at least 8 of them each.</p>

<p style="font-weight:400;">Should i aim more or i could do with less? I'll take my time crafting them (daily quest attempts + few more if i want it) so there's no hurry.</p><ac_metadata title="Holo radar"> </ac_metadata>
