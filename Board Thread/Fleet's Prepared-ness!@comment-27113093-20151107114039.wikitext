Hi everyone,Â 

I started playing Kancolle in September and never looked back, though my schedule has been very busy at the moment which means that I haven't been able to progress as much as other Teitoku that joined around the same time. v_v

With the Fall Event dangerously close, I realised I should've posted something earlier instead of lurking around on the wiki. Nevertheless, I really need some opinions from more experienced Teitokus here:

1. I don't think I can clear Easy with my current fleet (can I?), so how far will I be able to go?

2. What will I need to focus on before the event?

3. I'll be aiming to improve my fleet for Winter 2015 too. What should I do to prepare for that?

HQ Level 42 as I type this. I've cleared to 3-2. 4 fleets unlocked. Been stockpiling resources for a while though, nearing 20k for everything (will that be enough?).

Ship and Equipment list are here:
