I've been thinking about this for a while and I need some help deciding who to make my waifu (aka marry) here are the options

Kongou: the first kanmusu I ever found out about, and she very quickly became one of my favorites with her BURNING LOVE

Nagato: What can I say? She's goddamn nagato. Kick ass, and cute at the same time. 

Yamashiro: I feel quite a bit for yamashiro, because she was the first ship I ever ended up sinking and I feel like she finally made me realize what it really means to be a ttk and that when ships sink, IT'S FINAL. Once I got her back, she continued to be totally kick ass even though I had to relevel her again. She'll never be a "faulty battleship" in my book. But the thing is I don't see much use for a BBV and I want my waifu to be someone I use all the time. 

Yamato: Like Nagato, what can I say? Yamato (both the game and the real life one) have interested me for a while due to their famous strength and popularity. I came into this game wanting the best ship of all time, and I think that yamato fits that bill nicely.<ac_metadata title="Who should I make my waifu?"> </ac_metadata>
