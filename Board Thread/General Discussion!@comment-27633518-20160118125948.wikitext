I have doubts about translating 改 as Kai.  It is not part of the ship name, but rather a suffix meaning "remodel".  So translating as remodel, or even MK2 makes more sense to me, just as "甲" getting translated to "A" because it is the first of the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">character sequence used for</span> enumerate.  If 改 has to be Kai, should not "甲" be "Kan" or "Kou" rather than "A"? <ac_metadata title="Translation for 改、改二and改二甲" related_topics="Shoukaku" lastmove="1453123650"> </ac_metadata>
