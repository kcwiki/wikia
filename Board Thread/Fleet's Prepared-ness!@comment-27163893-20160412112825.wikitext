I







































[[File:Ghostsnova_resources.png|left]]currently have 1 BP however I'm saving it for Bismarck as next month I will be able to have her Drei. I did take part in the last event but didn't have the time needed to finish, because the next event is much bigger I want to be ready. Currently I'm still leveling Bismarck for the time being then I was planning to level up the Kongou sisters to get their Kai Ni.



Any tips or advice would be very much appreciated.<ac_metadata title="What difficulty can I do? What equipment do I need and who I should focus on leveling?"> </ac_metadata>
