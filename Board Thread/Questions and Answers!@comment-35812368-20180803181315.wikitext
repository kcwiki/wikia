So to my understanding is i need to have 41cm twin gun and Mutsu or Nagato kai 

to make the triple 41cm i need to use 1 more 41 twin and other resources...

but it won't allow crafting the Prototype 41cm triple in the option...

so i suspect that i need to max out the 41cm twin first? <ac_metadata title="How to make Prototype 41cm triple gun?"> </ac_metadata>
