(post originally posted at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/91tj3s/getting_advice_on_what_equipment_i_should_improve/]])

I have been playing KC for almost 3 years (joined in August 2015 while the Summer 2015 AA Hime event was in full force) and I have already played 10 events (everyone since Fall 2015) so far. Yet after all these years I'm still not confident that my equipment are up to shape for consistent Full Hard clear for events. That (and time for playing/ship farming/resources woes) meant that my only Full Hard clear so far was the relatively easy Spring 2017 event (most of the others were cleared with 1-2 maps in Medium mode).

Anyway with my ships more or less in shape for any event (just get all those LV 78/86 destroyers and the 2 seaplane carriers to LV 90 and that's probably OK) what I want to ask is: with my 230 screws left, what equipment should I improve?

'''Plans are already made for getting Iwai Zero 52C to 10 stars, an extra Type 4 Sonar (hence the lone Type 93 sonar is still around) and get all my 16 inch Mk. 7 / Proto-41 cm Triple guns to 4 stars, but I'm unsure of what to do next.'''

Here are my comments on each type of equipment I have in store:

Small guns - with 8 ducky guns on 6 stars I don't believe that this is high priority - getting them to MAX is surely a bonus but I'm not sure how much more benefit would that bring. As for those 12.7 cm Type C/D guns, I simply believe that they are still too niche to be of frequent use and I don't think they are high on my improvement list......or are they?

Medium guns - I have been keeping the "no dupe ships" principle so far so I only have that many 20.3 cm No. 3 guns, although my minds have changed somewhat lately on this policy. Unfortunately I don't have enough PVP places for dupe ships leveling yet so all Medium guns improvements are on hold (I think the 15.2 cm twin is too niche today). Given that the night battle power for the No.2 gun has recently been restored, is this really much of a handicap?

Large guns - I honestly don't know what to do with them - it's obvious the 16 inch Mk. 7 / Proto-41 cm Triple are the ones to go for universal BB guns, but the improvement costs are high and, um, seeing as if everyone aiming for Full Hard clears have GFCS guns made me fear if I'm missing anything (way too expensive for me until very recently, and I still need a source for 41 cm twins first). Is 4 stars enough to get most of the benefits?

Also should I improve the 46 cm Yamato guns now? They are simply that expensive to get at all.......

Torpedoes - As with the Medium guns, this is another area that I have not yet been getting around to yet after I softened my "no dupe ships" policy. Hopefully I'm not missing too much with Quad Oxygen torpedoes mounts used in between my 3 Quintuple ones......

Secondary guns - I guess no one improve their OTO guns anymore with their limited use? 

Fighter planes - Most of them have been improved/are about to get to 10 stars, although I wonder if I should turn my Skilled Zero Type 21 Max to become a Type 52, or if I should keep it as a 7 range plane team. There's also the problem of if my LBAS Oscar 64 should be improved: somehow this doesn't seems to be a priority yet many people do that anyway...

Special planes - Here it is. I recently finally got hold of the F6F-3N and the TBM-3D, and I wonder if the F6F-5N is a must have despite getting it will probably eat up half of my screw reserves and my still struggling bauxite capacity. I know that it's going to give a bigger punch when used instead of the -3N, but is that going to be that much that I should go for it straight away?

Jet Keiun is off my table right now - not when the future of jets is very uncertain.

Observation seaplanes - Are there any of them I should improve straight away? LoS doesn't seems to be a big deal nowadays.

SPF - I just got 2 new Type 2 SPFs lately, and I think 6 SPF is good enough....or should I get more? If so, I might turn 2 more Ro-43 into -44.

Radar - A weak area of my arsenal due to that I never seems to have enough bauxite (never got more than 80k, and usually below 50k), with Type 14/32/33 radars still completely missing. Should I bite the bullet and get a lot more better radar right now?

ASW - The number of OASW DDs have risen a lot lately and I think one more extra Type 4 sonar might be enough for the time being. Or is it?

Machine guns/AA guns - I heard that the Rocket Launcher K2 does wonders, and I wonder if I should get a few more via improvement. Otherwise, this is more of a "Which ship to get Reinforcement Expansions" question (more on that later).

Amphibians equipment - It's been a long time since they get very demanding uses in events. Are there any more of them that I need to improve quickly?

Others - Not sure of what else being worth for improvements. Are there any that I should improve now?<ac_metadata title="Getting advice on what equipment I should improve next and which ships to receive reinforcement expansions"> </ac_metadata>
