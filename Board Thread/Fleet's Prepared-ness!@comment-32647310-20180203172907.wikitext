In my last post on this topic, I got some pretty solid feedback and advice. I’ve also learned a few things while doing my own research in helping others (as well as myself!) out.
Now, I still intend on a full Medium clear and I still think I’m on the right track for this, I still would like a San-Check; I want to make sure that I am in fact on the right track and if, all things considered, a Medium Clear is something that is genuinely achievable. 
(Note – by ‘genuinely achievable’, I mean I have a good chance of doing this; I don’t need perfect runs…but I don’t want to have to perform occult rituals, offering up first-born children or otherwise rely on RNG-Senpai to notice me)

I want to reiterate that at this stage, I view taking on Medium to be a challenge that I look forward to meeting… I have absolutely *no* shame and will shift to Easy if push comes to shove.

At this point, I feel that the time for training is over; I must now focus on gathering/hoarding resources and conserving buckets. Any ships that meet my ‘Leveling Goals’ will be a welcome addition, but I’m not going to spam 4-3 or 5-4A. If I sortie to any of these maps, it will be with the express purpose of completing the daily and weekly sortie quests.

This all being said, here is where I stand right now:

'''Leveling'''<br />I have met what I feel was the reasonably achievable goals of getting my Historical ships to K2 or level 70. I know that not all of the ships are there (I stopped working on Nagato at 85, put Kiyoshimo, Asashimo and Hayashimo (who were all lower level) over Yukikaze (who has better stats) and all but ignored Takao and Atago)…but I am confident that I have enough non-historical ships of the right level and/or power to cover down on any gaps if they’re needed.

I still feel that starting the event with the ships at level 70 is good enough, as there should be plenty of opportunity to level up during the event and farming. If folks feel that this is erroneous, please let me know.

'''Equipment'''<br />
Before I get started, I want to thank Artie1207, Mob2104, and Devsquad74 for pointing me to additional resources as well as providing insight through their own posts on other threads. There are other players that have sprinkled bits of wisdom and food for thought on other threads but are too numerous to properly list out here. Thanks guys!
With that out of the way, I think I’m tracking about as well as I can right now with my equipment:<br />
- I have 2x Proto 35.6cm guns and will be able to get 2 more when I get the screws, and another 2 when I finally upgrade Fusou and Yamashiro for a total of 6.<br />
- Getting more 35.6cm guns to +6 should not be too much of a problem.<br />
- I have put some work into the 381mm pasta-gun because the VL range is a nice-to-have because it fits on ‘smaller’ ships and at +4, its accuracy penalty is *mostly* mitigated.<br />
- I may put some work into the 41cm twins, as I have enough materials to support getting them to +4, but I don’t see progressing beyond that immediately; the benefits to not outweigh the costs right now.
I do not see myself putting much effort into the 46cm triples in the near future; they are just too expensive to upgrade both in costs and materials.

The general focus on gun upgrades will, most likely remain focused on getting more 20.3cm (No.2)s leveled up. I have a lot of them and a lot of ships use them. Given my general lack of screws right now, I don’t think I’ll do much more than that

There are some things I can do later on in regards to guns, shells and other pieces of equipment, but they are long-term efforts and won’t help me too much right now.

'''Resources'''<br />
This is where I suddenly feel myself lacking. As it stands right now, I have the following:<br />
Fuel: 78k<br /> 
Ammo: 71k<br />
Steel: 67k<br />
Bauxite: 79k<br />
Buckets 700

My concern is that I’m just not going to have enough of fuel, ammo and steel as the best information that I’ve been able to find suggests 100k fuel and 80k for both ammo and steel. Yes, I am aware that I can spam certain expeditions and can limit my sorties in general, but also focus on high-return expeditions…but I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m not going to be able to pull in enough before I jump in (probably about 3-5 days after the event kicks off).<br />
I mean, while working on completing 4-5, I used 2x BB and 4x CV, one of which was Musashi, and burned over 700 ammo on one sortie. I shudder to think about what those costs would look like with a Combined Fleet and a Support Expedition.

It is here where I pose my question especially to more experienced players who have more than one large-scale event under their belts; is an all Medium clear reasonably possible? Is there anything that I can do between now and go-time to improve my chances?
