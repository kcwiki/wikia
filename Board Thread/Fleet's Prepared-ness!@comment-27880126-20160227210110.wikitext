So I am brand new to this wikia though i've used it in the past for information on getting quests done as well as crafting.  I was hoping i could get some help maybe not so much for this current event but for future events as to what i should do to move my fleet of lovely's I mean Shipgirls in the right direction.  Any advice is welcome even if it is criticisim.  I'm including Equipment but I know that there are a lot of important stuff missing.  Thanks in advance...
