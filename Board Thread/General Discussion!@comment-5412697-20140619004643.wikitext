Im just wondering how much people have experienced the fate of a ship when is sunk...

It's an unexplainable feeling, specialy the first time

If someone has experienced that kind of end... when was it? how and what ship was?

Personaly my 1st(and only atm) was at lv10 on 1-2 with my lv7 Maruyu, and still 42lv's later and I can't build her again<ac_metadata title="A ship&#039;s fate"> </ac_metadata>
