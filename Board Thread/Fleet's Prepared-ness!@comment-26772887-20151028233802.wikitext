My HQ lvl is 98 (still single). And this my fleet

I'm grinding Haguro right now and Yamashiro, Mogami, Takao, Chiyoda and Hiyou as escort.



And some upgraded equipment is 12.7cm twin +10 (2x), 41cm twin +3, 35.6cm twin +6 and +4, Quadruple O2 torp +6 (5x) and +4, Type 91 AP +6 (3x)



My resource now is 41k/40k/39k/26k/153 :'v (plz I know I lack of bucket). I aimed 250++ bucket for this event.
