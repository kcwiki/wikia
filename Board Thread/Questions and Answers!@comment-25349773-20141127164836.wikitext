Well, I was on E-3 with subs (I didn't have too many CLTs and were replacing them with subs) and at the night battle before the boss, my sub (I-168 Kai) took 13 damage from an enemy Tsu-class. From what I'd seen here, I was pretty sure subs could only receive scratch damage in night battles. Is this wrong or does this apply differently for enemy subs and friendly subs?Â <ac_metadata title="Can submarines be dealt more than 1 damage in night battles?"> </ac_metadata>
