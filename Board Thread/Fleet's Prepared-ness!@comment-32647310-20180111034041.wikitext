Okay, I guestamate I have about 30 days or so (give or take) before the Winter 2018 Event as all past Winter Events took place within the first 2 weeks of February. 

With this in mind, I figured that it would be a good idea to get a general sanity-check on my fleet so I can be better prepared.

I would like to complete the event on Medium/Normal Difffculty. While I have no shame and would gladly shift to Easy Mode if it comes down to it, I view tackling Medium as a bit of a challenge. 

This being said, here are my intended preparation goals:<br />
- Get as many of the Historial Ships to K2 as reasonably possible.<br />
        For those ships that do not have a K2 yet, I figure that Level 70 would be in the realm of "Good Enough", as many ships (especially DDs) get their K2 at about that level.<br />
        For those ships that require blueprints (Naganami, Nagato, Tama...), I would at least like them to be at (or at least rather close) to the level needed for K2 (for example, Chikuma is ready for K2, she just needs the blueprint).

- In the event that some ships can't make it to the desired level in time and/or I do not own, have some "backups" that are of the equivilent level on-hand (Ayanami and Poi filling in for DDs, Prinz and Pola for CAs for example). 

- Develop sufficient equipment through Akashi (this is where I may need the most help on...)

My primary reason for my choice of level 70+ is because during the Fall Event, I genuinely tried to clear everything on Medium. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I could not get that final kill on the Night Strait Princesses. I attribute this to my ships not being high enough level for purposes of accuracy, evasion and other 'soft' stats that can only be increased via leveling. I mean, neither of the Fusou-Sisters were K2, and were barely above level 70 and no other Battleships (of *any* kind) were at that level except Kirishima and Kongou. This being said, I figure that K2/Level 70 will be good enough to start the event, with plenty of opportunity to gain additional levels as the event progresses. 

With all of this in mind and the fact that Winter 2018 will be "sufficiently difficult" on Normal and Hard, is this a reasonable training plan?

With regard to my equipment crafting/developing, I will be quite clear: I do *not* fully understand what bonuses are given to upgrades with the exception of Fighters and Daihatsus. I understand that a +10 on a fighter grants +2 to the plane's AA stat (a +10 M52 (Skilled) is the same as having +11 AA instead of +9)...but I do not understand how these bonuses apply to guns, radar and the like. It is because of this, that I have generally not bothered upgrading guns. The guns I have upgraded are because I either A - had nothing else to do that day for crafting, B - upgraded with the specific intent of taking it to the next level (a 12.7 twin to a 12.7 twin Model B K2, for example) or C - I had no idea what I was doing because I was new to the game.

This being said, I do not have any real 'Aircraft' goals at the moment. I have enough Seaplane Fighters and unless a 'Skilled Crewmember' falls in my lap, I do not see a reason to work too hard on maxing out any M21's 

So my question is this: What should I be working on upgrading? Keep in mind, I do not have a lot of screws at the moment (I have 9 and I have completed most of the Weekly Quests. Those that have not been done are not worth the pain/effort *cough* World 4 *cough*, and some upgrade materials can be pretty hard to come by as well. 

My next question regarding equipment is what should I be crafting as part of my Daily Quests? For the longest time, I have been focusing on aircraft, either as upgrade materials or so I can have enough good planes around. Short of working on getting Jets (I am not touching World 6 yet!) or somehow having Saratoga magically fall in my lap, I don't really know what else I need.

For those that may want to know, here are my resources at present:<br />
Fuel: 29.7k<br />
Ammo: 30.8k<br />
Steel: 40.9k<br />
Bauxite: 35.7k<br />
Buckets: 441<br />

I do not think I will have much of a problem in gathering more resources, so I don't think that will be much of an issue, but who knows?!?

I appreciate any thoughts and advice you all may have.[[File:Winter_2018_ShipList_2018-01-10.jpg|thumb|Winter Event list and the ships I'm mostly focusing on for leveling.]][[File:Ship_List_2018-01-10.jpg|thumb|My entire fleet.]][[File:Equipment_List_2018-01-10.jpg|thumb|left|My full equipment list.
