I read that subs are effective for drawing fire when leveling, but I'm having to put my sub into dock after each sortie. Tried putting her in flagship postion but still getting wrecked.

My only sub right now is I-58, and she's level 11. Also been modernizing for armor.<ac_metadata title="Tanking with Sub?"> </ac_metadata>
