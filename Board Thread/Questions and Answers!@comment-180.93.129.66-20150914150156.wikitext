I really wanted Shoukaku in my team, but I'm too weak to go to world 4 (and wasn't planning to,anyway). I've heard that you can get Shoukaku in LSC, but what are the chances? Can anyone tell me, because if it's decently higher than normal craft, I'd happily burn my resource and challenge RNG-sama just to get her :D<ac_metadata title="Shoukaku in LSC"> </ac_metadata>
