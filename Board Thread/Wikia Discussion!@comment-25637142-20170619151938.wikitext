;What is this?
:This is a training exercise to prepare our new trainees for upcoming KanColle events.

;Who can sign up for this?
:Anyone who're keen on giving back to the community and don't know how are welcome to sign up for this exercise. Training and mentorship will be provided as part of the exercise.

;How does this work?
{{for|more information|User_blog:Fujihita/Inside_KanColle_Wiki_Event_Panic_Drill}}

:In this exercise, we'll attempt to emulate the conditions of a real event by introducing a set of mock-up tweets, fleet composition report sheets, PoiDB dump data, frontline reports and game assets. The trainee team must compile these mock-up data into a complete Event Page, along with any accompanying articles, threads and infrastructures. Information will be introduced to the trainees via designated channels and at a specific order similar to what they can expect from an actual event.

;Why use "exercise" instead of "drill" this time?
<blockquote class="styled"><span style="font-size:12px; color:#444;">''McDerp wrote:''</span><br>
We really need to put "This is just an exercise on the wikia, not an actual in-game event." somewhere. In fact people have no idea what a drill means outside of that instrument meant for industrial applications.
Next time call it an exercise event if you can.
</blockquote>
:So we're changing to KanColle terms this time.

;Where to sign up?
:Registration has closed for this season.
