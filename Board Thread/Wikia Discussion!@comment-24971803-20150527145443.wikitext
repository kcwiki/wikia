<s>As we all have discovered, chat has died once again, but this time it's apparently not Wikia's fault.
socket.io's Security Certificate died today, causing everyone who uses it to kaput.

<s>Here's a short term solution to joining chat since socket.io's Security Certificate has died. https://cdn.socket.io <-- '''Click this.'''

As long as you're using chrome, you should get a message that the site is horribly insecure and people will eat you. '''Press continue anyway.''' Once you see a "Welcome" text, you can close this site.

Then close any tabs with chat open, and try opening chat again. You should be able to rejoin chat after this.

'''Use at your own risk''' I have no idea what bypassing a single security certificate will do, so if you're paranoid, just wait till Socket.io stops fucking about and renews their certificate.</s>
