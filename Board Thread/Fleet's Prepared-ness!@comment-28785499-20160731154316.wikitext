Hello there fellow teitokus!

A total skrubs here, started on 8 May 2016, decided not to participate into the spring event (even though i want that "Freedom" girl), and here i am, still a skrubs almost 3 months later :D

Without further ado here'sÂ [http://imgur.com/a/VgwPl my fleet compositions]

I guess theres no other way except Easy mode. No rushing of course, since i think my resources + buckets is not enough (around 24k on all resources with 164 buckets as of time of this post)...

Also, i will have a blueprint before event, so enlighten me on which one to give first, or should i keep it first....

Let the skrubs bashing begin!<ac_metadata title="First time event for a first time admiral! (Easy Mode w/o rushing)"> </ac_metadata>
