Hey guys, I'm new and i've been trying to pass the lottery. I got the page with the cat and the girl where you have to refresh every 5 minutes. Problem is, I've been going at it for 6 hours and I still can't see if i've failed or got in...

I've cleared my cache, logged out and back in and even waited 30 minutes before refreshing but it still shows the same image: http://puu.sh/iLRUf/8c816c24bc.png

I've attempted the lottery before (and failed) but atleast everything was going normally.

I don't know if i should just try another day or if there's still a chance to get to the server screen.<ac_metadata title="Stuck on the refresh page during lottery."> </ac_metadata>
