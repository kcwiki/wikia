I totally don't know about you guys case. In my case, fish won't drop anymore for me even I am farming at 1-5, 1-1, 3-3, 6-1, 6-5.   It just wont drop when my fishes stock reached 25.   I also try " daily reset" fish which just a hypothesis, worth a try. Still no luck.

So anyone doesnt get any fish drop let's me know.<ac_metadata title="Fish stop dropping at number 25." related_topics="World 6: 中部海域"> </ac_metadata>
