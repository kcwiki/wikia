Just how do you guys stick to playing this game for months and even years without getting bored?

I've been playing KanColle since the mid of last year and I just can't be bothered anymore to progress further by leveling ships, grinding resourcs and such.The feeling of boredom I get is even worse than playing one of those Korean MMORPGs grindfest.

I envy any of you guys here who's able to play this game on daily basis, espically those who started playing the game when it first came out.<ac_metadata title="Repetitive and tedious... Anyone feel the same?"> </ac_metadata>
