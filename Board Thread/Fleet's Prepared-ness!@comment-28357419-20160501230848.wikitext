Greetings fellow Admirals! How are you? Ready for the event? Because i think i might not be able to do it on hard with what i have. Been one years since i last played the game, i had an really busy years but it worth every second because right now i do have a lot of time to spare <3.Â 

Now, those are my stats / ships and equipment. I will wait your judgement fellow Admirals! Also thanks in advance :)
