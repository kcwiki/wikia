I am planning to make a poll for "how prepare is your shipgirl" from [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Winter_2016_Event/@comment-Lici_Ui-20160203084417 Talk:Winter 2016 Event/@comment-Lici Ui-20160203084417]<span style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;line-height:26px;"> ‎</span> but not sure which section in forum to post. After opening it, I was like:

Event official threads: No

Event Community Discussion: Yes..... eh? A place for help advice for event.... No

Fleet's Prepared-ness: Almost

General Discussion: Not sure

Q & A, Wikia Discussion, Off topic: No

Any suggestion are more than welcome<ac_metadata title="Which thread should I post a poll?"> </ac_metadata>
