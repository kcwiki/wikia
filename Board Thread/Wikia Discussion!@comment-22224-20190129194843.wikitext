Hello,

This month Fandom received a formal [[wikipedia:Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act|DMCA takedown notice]] from the owners of the Kancolle game regarding thousands of images uploaded on this community. Due to the DMCA law's requirements and stipulations, we are legally bound to comply with this request.

Fandom will pursue a dialogue with the Kancolle group to see if we can reach an agreement that will allow us to again host these images, but we must delete the images expeditiously in the interim.

Starting tomorrow and throughout the rest of the week, I will run a script to delete all images from:

[[:Category:Twitter Illustrations]]

[[:Category:Ship image assets]]

[[:Category:Equipment image assets]]

These images are '''NOT''' allowed to be reuploaded and I will have to ban those that do.<ac_metadata title="Announcement from Fandom Regarding Thousands of Wiki Images"> </ac_metadata>
