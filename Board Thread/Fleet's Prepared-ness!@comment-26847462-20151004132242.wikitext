From the previous event (http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:292910)
I overestimated my fleet and resources and consequently failed to secure that Yamato's radar. In this time, I plan to do next event at least medium. My resources now are under 10k and I might not be able to stockpile much since the Mackerel hunt is coming. Do I prepare my fleet enough?   

Here is my fleet:
