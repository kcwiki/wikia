After playing for a year, I found this little stroll down memory lane to be quite nostalgic.

Sort your ships by 'new', who were your first six?

-Hibiki, Akatsuki, Shigure, Ikazuchi, Miyuki, Inazuma

(Fubuki was my starter but used her as modernization material since I wanted Akatsuki as my starter for rp reasons but seems like miss first class came late.)<ac_metadata title="First Six Ships"> </ac_metadata>
