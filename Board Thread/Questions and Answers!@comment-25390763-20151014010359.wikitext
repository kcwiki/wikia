I'm sorry is this has been asked before, but I didn't find anything when searching, so I have to ask. I'll get straight to the point and ask, and follow-up with tl;dr details and info afterwards.

'''Are Dive Bombers more resilient than Torpedo Bombers, or are they both equally likely to be shot down?'''

On to the details. I never actually asked this question in the past, but rather had ''very angry ''"veteran" *cough*elitist*cough* players yelling at some other people about their plane loadouts about a year ago, primarily saying 2 things:

'''A)''' Torpedo Bombers are useless (I now know this information to be utterly useless, but it's the reason that follows that got most people to listen) because they get shot down far too easily and 

'''B) '''Dive Bombers will do more damage based on how high the carrier's Firepower stat is, which is why Hiryuu is so damn good.

The above is more-or-less a quote and they reiterated multiple times that Dive Bombers should be placed in the 2 Smaller slots of the carrier, with 2 Fighters in the bigger slots, and that if anyone ''insisted ''on using Torpedo Bombers, to put them on a slot that was larger than the slot they were using for Dive Bombers because of the difference in durability.

Basically, my questions are

Was there ever a difference in the durability of the 2 types of bombers?

If so, is there still a difference now, with or without enemy AACI and Aircraft Proficiency, obviously?

I still play as if this was a thing, so here are a couple of examples showing typical loadouts I would use according to this knowledge, true or not. (obviously not 2 Saiuns in one fleet, these are just examples)[[File:CTHR.png|thumb]][[File:CTRJ.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Bomber Survivability"> </ac_metadata>
