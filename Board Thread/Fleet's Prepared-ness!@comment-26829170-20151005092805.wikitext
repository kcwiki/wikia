With the mercy of RNG i was able to clear the hellish Summer 2015 Event on its last day but with 3 map on Easy. This time i heard Fall Event will be small-scale so i want a Full-Hard clear.

Here r my main force and equipment. Where do i need and what i can do to improve them? Also who should i give the next BP? I have Choukai, ABKM, Roma waiting.[[File:Main_force.png|thumb]][[File:Main_equip.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Aiming for Full-Hard, need lots of advice"> </ac_metadata>
