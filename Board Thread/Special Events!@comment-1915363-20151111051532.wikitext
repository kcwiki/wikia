A.k.A. Regarding New Enemy Ship Parameters

As some of the data miners have already realized by now, the Abyssal ship parameters are no longer listed in the master data since the Summer Event, which means fighting the bosses and new enemies themselves would be some of the only way to obtain any reliable information regarding them. I would like to request the clearers to help out and fill in the wiki entries for the new enemies we've fighting whereas possible.

According to dragonjet, the api_eParam and api_eSlot entry in "kcsapi/api_req_sortie/battle" has the basic information regarding the enemy. It doesn't reveal the whole thing though, certain info such as plane slots and soft stats aren't listed in there either.

Players whom wishes to help out can keep the network tab open in their browser, encounter the enemy with the software on and post the resulting API call with the description (which enemy) here. The wiki administrators/moderators as well as myself will fill in the wiki details from here.

For those who uses KC3Kai, you can keep the Admiral Panel open as all the API calls would be automatically listed in the Network tab. Players who uses KCV can install the Fiddler2 to retrieve the API calls.      <ac_metadata title="[Fall 2015] Naval Intelligence Command HQ" notify_everyone="1448020462" related_topics="PT Imp Pack|Submarine Princess|Destroyer Water Demon|Fall 2015 Event"> </ac_metadata>
