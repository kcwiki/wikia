I know this it's not related to Kancolle but since this wikia is full of nice peoples, i thought this was a good place to ask... 

Yesterday i found and tried the Granblue Fantasy game on the DMM page and i kinda liked it, so if someone else on this wikia play the game too, what about playing some co-op and stuff together sometimes "And since i started yesterday maybe you can give me some tips about the game too"

So, for everyone who is interested, feel free to add me to the friends list, my game ID is: 17364660 and my In-Game name is サイレン<ac_metadata title="About the Granblue Fantasy game on DMM" lastmove="1496060357"> </ac_metadata>
