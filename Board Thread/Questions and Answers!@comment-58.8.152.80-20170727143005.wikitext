I got this bug when one of my fleet greatly successful went expedition. I sent them on the No.24 expe. and a notice text already shown but the fleet still "on expedition". Checking inÂ  the expedition panel, it state clearly no fleet proceeding it. Has anyone faced something like this?<ac_metadata title="[Bug] Fleet not return after expedition..."> </ac_metadata>
