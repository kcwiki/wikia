Hello.

I know I don't have a snowball's chance of clearing this event with my current resources, so my sole goal is to (hopefully) get an event ship or two and some equipment to remember Phase 1 by. To this end, I'd like some advice on how to most efficiently spend the few screws I have on upgrading event essential gear. I currently have 44 screws but should have about 50 or so by the end of the week.

Today I burned 6k Bauxite and 80 screws on getting 2 Seaplane Fighters so at least that's out of the way, but how many T91 Shells and which guns should I focus on?

I'm pretty much on track with my levelling, current goals being to get my Myoukous and Zuikaku to K2 and get the few historical ships I have, as well as my CAVs and a few extra DDs to decent levels.

If there are any suggestions on other ships I should focus on, please let me know. Thank you in advance for any help.
