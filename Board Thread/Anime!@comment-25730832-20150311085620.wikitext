After the Fubuki episode last week; her drama and tragic sand digging, the episode ended with one of the worst admiral getting base bombed. Did he die? Did he live? Did he ever exist? Will this episode tragedy get sweep under the carpet like episode 3? Or is he the real antagonist of the show? Find out today in "I feel like they ran out of idea for title"!
