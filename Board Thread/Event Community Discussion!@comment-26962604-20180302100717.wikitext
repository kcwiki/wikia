I know that we still have 2~3 weeks left, but right now I'm power leveling my carriers and doing EO so I want to make sure I can finish this event on the highest difficulty possible and farm on said difficulty.

I just finished E5.

My fleet/equip and resources    132K fuel  138K ammo 101K metal 100K baux   521 buckets
