Since I kinda messed up the last dance in E-7 summer. I'll need a bit of help on the things I must prioritize. But I can't promise to deliver the 100% results because I have limited use on the computer starting this today.

Well, As you can see, the DDs are underlevelled and the CAs are awefully underlevelled.

But since I'll be clearing Easy, I think This would be enough. Say, What measures can I take? I am currently levelling Junyou, Haguro, Fusou, Maya, and Shoukaku. I am also levelling Yuudachi and Abukuma too just in case a CLT forbidden map arises. I currently have 9 medals and I can get 3 more or 4 if 4-5 is managable.

I don't have Shimakaze just in cae you want to me to level her. I have Yukikaze at level 55 just in case you try to look for her. I do have a 2 12.7cm kai B guns, but no Akizuki guns because Fubuki is still at level 40.

So, what should I do more? what should I stop doing? I am willing to stop fishing just in case I need to seriously power level my destroyers.

small fact: I managed to reach the E-7 last dance with one Kai Ni Destroyer.<ac_metadata title="I&#039;m not that ready at all... for fall event"> </ac_metadata>
