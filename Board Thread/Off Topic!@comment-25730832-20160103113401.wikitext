<center>'''Welcome to the Church of Fumism'''</center>

<center>''We worship our one and only true salvation, [[Fumizuki]]. Join us...young ones, and let our goddess [[Fumizuki]] show you the way. She shall save you. She shall save us all; the lost cause of the society....the lolicons...from our sins.''----

'''The Fumi Code'''

''Plot is a lie, there is only justice.''

''Through justice, I gain strength.''

''Through strength, I gain power.''

''Through power, I gain a loli.''

''Through a loli, my chains are broken.''

''The Fumi shall free me.''

<center>'''The Fumi Commandments'''</center>

And Fumi spoke all these words, saying, I am Fumizuki thy Loli, who brought thee out of the land of Breast, out of the house of boobs.

#Thou shalt have no other loli before me.

#Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
#Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
#Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
#Thou shalt not kill.
#Thou shalt not commit adultery.
#Thou shalt not steal.
#Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
#Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.
