Requested from [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Fall_2015_Event/@comment-Lici_Ui-20151205040651 Talk:Fall 2015 Event/@comment-Lici Ui-20151205040651]<span style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;line-height:26px;"> ‎to post it here for refence, generally for TTKs to check through your trait from your event experience to find what possibly lacking and what can be improve beside blaming on LUCK LUCK LUCK. The thread here is more on self-reflection and less on judging others on their evaluation, thought and believe, but constructive respond and support are more than welcome.</span>

|This is a theoretical made up model to back track what kind of trait you might left out during this event and possible to be strengthen up for the next coming event.


Acclaim: This model is not completely true, improvement via discussions are encouraged.

Define for:

Aim/goal- The aim of what you are going to get or achieved here. Will determine the whole direction and scope of the event.

Inner traits:

Management- Determine from how well you apply what you got.

Judgement- Insight to be able to choose the right choice.

Sanity- Your rational thinking or go crazy all together with emotion.

Those inner factors can effect each other such as Sanity disturb your judgement and management, hence effect your Aim and Goal in generally.



Outer traits:

Set Up- The strength of your fleet and equipment available in both deep and width

Resource- The 6 type on your top right and other kind of resource such as Mamiya, expansion, repair and more.

Time- Available time to play or run the game continuously.

Intelligence- Reliable information you gain here, personally or from other sources.

Skill- Technique you had and able to help you in your analysis and evaluation during your decision making.

Experience- How much you have gain from each events.

Luck- RGN

Attitude- Your determination and mind set in the event.

Support- Environment you are in which can affect you, example the community.

Traits that further categorized from inner traits. Those outer trait can also interact with each other such as mind set you got from long experience change your attitude, skill you developed to prepare a better set up or the community encourage you to buy slots.



So how to use this model?

First check each trait from outer to inner to see whether you have it or not, next write down how strong this trait you have and give a fact example. After that, evaluated which traits is your strength and which one is weaker. Finally conclude which trait can be improve and how you can do so.



Example from my Winter 2015 event ([http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Winter_2015_Event/@comment-Lici_Ui-20150215112015 Talk:Winter 2015 Event/@comment-Lici Ui-20150215112015]) :

Outer traits:

Set Up- Quite Strong, fleet with proper equipment. Having 90 Yamasushi/Fusous/5CV(B), lighter ships around 80s, well balance, enough reppuu to fill CVs and good guns to spares.

Resource- Weak, start event with soft cap around 26k each.

Time- Average, average time of 4 hours to play daily, but not enough to farm high amount of resource needed.

Intelligence- Acceptable good, great inform from frontliner. Although I miss out a crucial bracing rule such as fBB allow in south road in E4 that I had waste some resource with low level Naka or northern road before this inform came in. The other one is that you don’t need to finish previous map in hard mode but E5 to get the A medal.

Skill- Not much, mostly decided and followed recommend 3-2-A levelling and Katori PVP levelling while comparing the best ship to train from the comparison in ship listing.

Experience- Medium, this is the 4th Events joined while the last one, fall 14 was a success. Hence, I had underestimated this event by starting with soft cap.

Attitude- Not good, giving up the challenge of A medal too early with more than a week to go.

Luck- One bad RGN troll around E4 final kill.

Support- Good support from the community here in the past such as going recommendation.

Inner traits:

Management- Manage well in fleet strength but resource before the event, hence was spending them wisely until I meet E4 boss the 4th time.

Judgement- Fail to notice the difference of reward for E4 Hard mode and E4 Medium mode is 3 improvement screw away, but I done it anyway…

Sanity- Lose my sane on E4 hard final kill.



Aim/goal- Was aim for A medal, but end with C medal

Strength: Set up, support

Weakness: Resource, Attitude, Experience, Intelligent



Conclude that next time I can’t underestimate the event, stocking up my resources, stay calm and think rationally before deciding



Result: Done all hard Spring 15 within a week.

After that, Lack of time because of RL…
