Hey all! 

So over the past three weeks I've been offhandedly working on revamping the Quests page to give it a bit of an updated look; You can look at that ->[[User:SmokeyTheButt/Quests_Page_Revamp|here]]<-. Mostly only the look has changed to make it, in my mind, a bit more appealing to look at, while also fixing and summarizing some requirements and keeping it consistent.

Now before I implement it though, I'd like to hear what you guys think. I know some of you have already commented on my Suggestions post about this, and I thank you for that. But, if you have any questions, concerns, or things you would like to be put in or taken out, let me know. Also, I haven't gotten around to writing an introduction to the page yet, but I think using the one we have now, with a bit of editing, is good enough.  <ac_metadata title="Quest Page Revamp" notify_everyone="1434630736"> </ac_metadata>
