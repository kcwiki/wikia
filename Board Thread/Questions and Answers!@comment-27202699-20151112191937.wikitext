Hi! This is my first post here, I'm pretty new to the game I guess, I joined about one week in of the summer event and it was a pretty scary entry to the game, that event was horrible and it took everything for me to get kawakaze before giving up...

I read all the FAQs and somehow luckily got a bismark and musashi pretty early on when I tested LSC for the fun of it. I followed the 3-2A farm strategy which worked very well for them, other BBs and CV/Ls but this doesn't seem to work as well for DDs and CLs also because of my mad rush to K2 haruna and kongou, I've become too overlevelled to do the 1-5 method.

So my main question is there a better way to level CL/DDs than slowly leeching at 3-2A?
And while I am at it, is there a good way of getting bauxite?

Also I've never been in any events except the summer one so I am pretty scared about the fall event, should I just stick with easy or should try out medium and is it worth doing it on medium?<ac_metadata title="How do I power level CL/DDs"> </ac_metadata>
