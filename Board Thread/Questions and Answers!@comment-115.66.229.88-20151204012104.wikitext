<span style="font-weight:normal;">I'm not sure if here's the right place, but erm, can you do anything to the Sortie Card Images for replays? Like compromise the account or smth? (Other than watching the runs of course) I was figuring how to upload to the bit.ly and accidentally uploaded to a random website... </span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">(Yes, due to me not typing the bit.ly correctly and got sent to a website that also says to upload an image, which I later figured it's a random site)</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">I'm not a smart person, Please don'tÂ bite :s</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">PS: Still not able to upload to the bit.ly link given on the card.</span><ac_metadata title="Sortie Replay Card Images"> </ac_metadata>
