I plan to tackle Winter 2016 Event on full Hard Mode, which is said to be hell. I have confidence in my girls's level, but i'm worried that they may not have the best gun for the fight. So what i can do to improve them? Craft more or focus on improvement ( not much was done since i just got Akashi recently)
