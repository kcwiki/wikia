anybody else branch off to a lot of the other nodes instead of the boss node on world 4-1, i tried a few different fleet compositions but it seems i either go straight west avoiding the boss node, or toward the southernmost node I, ive done the world quite a few times with no luck getting to the boss node, am i just being impatient or did any other admirals have to deal with this?

P.S. my main concern is to beat the boss in higher hopes of achieving shimakaze since i heard she drops more frequently there ;-;<ac_metadata title="world 4-1"> </ac_metadata>
