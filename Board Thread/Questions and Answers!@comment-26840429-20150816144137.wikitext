Hello, I had a question regarding farming bauxite. It seems expeditions only offer a select few that even give the resource, with #6 giving the best at 120-ish per hour. I've also seen bauxite drop from 2-2 and 4-3. I was wondering which of these 2 maps is more efficient for bauxite farming. Also is there other maps or ways of farming bauxite that I should be aware of? Thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="Farming Bauxite?"> </ac_metadata>
