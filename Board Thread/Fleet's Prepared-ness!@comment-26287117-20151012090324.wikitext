I wanna know if I can handle hard or are my girls can handle it..

Summer2015 was a nightmare coz it was my first event. I cleared most of the maps in easy. It was frustratingly fun and I even went full batshit insane. kek

Since there are no news yet.. I want to know if my fleetbabes level are alright to face hard mode.

Kai Ni before fall event:

Hibiki, Akatsuki, Ayanami, Kiso and Shoukaku. And level Oh yodo, Suzuya and Kuma.

I dont need Tone-class yet since CA/Vs are tiring to grind.



Here's my kanbabes and Equipments: http://imgur.com/a/8AWwV



Possible Start of event Resources: (Since Fall Event is a Small to Med scale war.)

70-80k, 70-80k, 50k, 25k and 500-600 Buckets.

This is enough to clear hard and farm right? no rushing.



Thats all folks..

I will be back next month to update this.

Feedbacks and advices from players that can clear all medium to hard are gonna be helpful. Anyone is wecome but I would love some Veterans advice.
