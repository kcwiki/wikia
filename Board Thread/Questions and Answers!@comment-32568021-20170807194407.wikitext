So, Im able to play KC about once a week, 30 minutes to 1 hour a session. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I was wondering what the most efficient way to play is taking these restrictions into account. Especially during the events. Last event my resources including bauxite never dropped below the daily cap, and my buckets went from 138-122. This is all due to the fact that, although I have enough of everything, I do not have the time to sortie. All tips are welcome!<ac_metadata title="casual play"> </ac_metadata>
