Hi all, I'm one of the admin of chinese KC wikia.<br />
Most of the parts of datas of chinese wiki has already done, but when I want to continue to develop other things, there has a problem that I didn't put the API ID of different ships into chinese wikia.

Can anybody here help me to output a list to display all APIIDs of different ships?<br />
‚Üê this stupid guy still don't know how to get the data from Lua modules

The best way to show is show the APIID after the first display ID , something like "1 : 80,275" for [[Nagato]](display ID:001).<br />
Thanks <(_ _)><ac_metadata title="Want some help from chinese wikia"> </ac_metadata>
