[[File:Kurdesso_Fleet_April.png|thumb]][[File:Kurdesso_April_2016_Equip.png|thumb]]Currently running expidition 2, 5 and 21 to get resources along with buckets. This would be my second event and I did beat the last event besides the third map as my goals weren't to get Zara nor the medal but tried to get pudding which was rather stupid of me.

Yes my equipment is a problem as I don't really know how to craft well.

Current goals for leveling is pretty much just getting as much CA to their Kai Ni state and also more of my BB's but i'm jsut worried about my resources going down faster than i could gather.Â 

Any feedback is accepted, thank you for your time.
