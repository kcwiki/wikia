On the year 2015, a silhouette can be seen through the morning mist. A lukewarm zephyr gently stirred her messy hair, signaling the end of winter. The figure cautiously floats around one last time through the bloodbath of the previous night.

The once proud Abyssal fleet; with their submarines that terrorized our shores, their planes that reigned over the sky and blot out the sun; their monstrous battleship that decimated even our finest fleet; all are now but remnants in the sea.

With one last twirl the figure moves out of the mist. A person came out. Except that this person is (a little girl/a tall and majestic woman/a timid woman who looks fragile at first sight/....etc.). Her uniform does not differentiate her from normal citizens, but you know who she is.

She is your strongest fighter, your pride, your wife(u), etc. As she drifted closer and closer to you, you left out a sigh of relief. After a long silence, she tilted her head and uttered a sentence.

"Good morning Admiral,Â ''Ooi'' is back from sortie"

With a smile on your face you welcomed back Ooi, your favorite lesbian.
