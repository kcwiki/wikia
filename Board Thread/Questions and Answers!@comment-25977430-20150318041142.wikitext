I relogged to my Wikia account becouse i got wierd message when i tried to update my profile page. "your session has expired", something..

After relog i refreshed the chat window, and it became all blank. (no user list, no text, nothing except two wikia logo pictures at their usual spots, and the borders between upper logo bar, input area, user list and chat area.

When i try to type in something - nothing happens.

I also purged my browser of everything including cookies etc, closed it, opened it, logged in and tried again, but the same thing happens. (using Chrome browser)



If someone has the Â idea on what's going on, i'd appreceate any help.<ac_metadata title="The Chat suddenly stopped working for me."> </ac_metadata>
