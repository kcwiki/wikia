(sorry if this doesn't count as off topic)

On the one day I want to go there to request a helper for the lottery (because so far I've had really rotten luck trying to get in myself) the forums go down. I guess my luck was worse than I thought 

Is it just maintenance, or are there server problems? Either way I hope it gets back up soon <ac_metadata title="What&#039;s with the himeuta forums being down?"> </ac_metadata>
