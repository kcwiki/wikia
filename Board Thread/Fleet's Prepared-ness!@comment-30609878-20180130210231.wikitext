[[File:Winter_2018_ShipList_2018-01-31.png|thumb|Current fleet]][[File:Equipment_List_2018-01-31.png|thumb|Current equipment]]I am more or less prepared for the upcoming Winter 2018 Event. I would like to reduce the 'less' part. I am currently crafting and upgrading AP shells for Musashi to get a better crit hit at the final boss.

And I am currently leveling that lvl 39 CA of Kurita fleet, that lvl 50 DD of Suzuki fleet and that lvl 45 DD of Shima fleet and of course Musashi herself.

Am I missing anything important?

Several pairs of eyes will see more than just my pair. ^^
