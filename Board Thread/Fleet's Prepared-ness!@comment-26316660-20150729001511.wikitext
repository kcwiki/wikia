I always use Support Shelling expedition in event. After getting Unryuu-class, I've been using 'em on my support expedition team. But after getting Katsuragi on last event, now I'm a bit confuse, which CV should I use, especially in event.

Which CV should I use for optimal result in Support, based on Cost-Performance? And which one should I use on Regular Support, and which one should I use on Boss Support Expedition? Maybe you can give some opinion about that, especially if devs only allow us to use Carrier Task Force on next event. Previous event, I used Unryuu-Amagi & Souryuu-Hiryuu but it was Surface Fleet.

Btw, Kaga and Taihou are out of question. I like to use 'em on sortie, rather than Support Exp. I have some good radars, and couple of Egusa Bombers & Suisei 601.

Thanks for your time
