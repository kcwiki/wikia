Am just leveling my Hamakaze&Urakaze together with my Choukai & Musashi in pvp and also training my dupe DE in 1-5.

As for equipment,am just creating another Type 2 Seaplane Fighter during my daily upgrades so I can have 4 SPF and switch for upgrading either my akiguns and 20.3cm(No.3) guns after I finish creating my SPF[[File:WinterNPCEL.jpg|thumb]].

Any advise should I do?[[File:WinterNPCHS.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Winter Prepping Medium/Hard Mix"> </ac_metadata>
