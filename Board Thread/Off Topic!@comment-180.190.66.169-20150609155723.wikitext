Hey guys, just wanna share something I have found while scouring the internet. As you all know the game is quite heavy especially for people with low-spec computers (I am using a Dell Inspiron Mini 1010) and especially when you are playing the game on Chrome, which is a resource hog. I can play the game but it's exactly smooth as it uses up 95% of my resource and it gets even worse as my netbook heats up, further diminishing its performance. So I decided to look for an alternative. And as I was browsing the net for a better browser to use, I stumbled upon MXNitro, a godsend solution to my problem. A total opposite of Chrome and as I am writing this while the game is running on another tab and as there are ten other tabs opened in the background, my CPU usage hovers at an average 30%. To summarize, if you guys are having a hard time playing the game on your computer while using Chrome, this is an awesome alternative.

Note: you still have to use the increase cache size method to run the game.<ac_metadata title="For those people using low-spec computers"> </ac_metadata>
