This should be the official discussion of what this wikia is, what we include, the areas of the franchise to be covered, and HOW we will cover them.

KanColle Kai
* remain on this wikia as an article only?
* remain on this wikia as a full-blown section with sub-pages on its updates, gameplay and other information?
* separate it on a new wikia?
* others?

The third one, I just heard from someone, don't know who said it or how the discussion went.

Notes to consider
* we already have the anime convered, with sub-pages
* are kai updates regular enough to have its own updates page?
* where to allow kai discussions, and its talk about its updates
* how kai will be portrayed in the frontpage
* do we also create threads on its updates just how we do it on PC version?<ac_metadata title="KanColle Kai, Wikia, the franchise" notify_everyone="1456025784"> </ac_metadata>
