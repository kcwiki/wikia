An Official Press Release Statement was released by DMM regarding other Company Games using the term '''"Kanmusu (艦娘)"'''. </div>

==Official Statement by DMM==
<div style="font-size:15px; color:brown; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;  margin:25px 0px 10px 0px;">''<p style="text-align: center;">''<span style="color:brown;">
We, DMM Ltd. have noticed other companies using the term '''"Kanmusu (艦娘)"''' to promote their games.
<br>

These games are not related to "Kantai Collection - Kancolle" in any way.
<br>

The term '''"Kanmusu (艦娘)"''' was created upon the creation of Kantai Collection to refer to the Game's Characters, and thus we believe it is a very essential component of our Game.
<br>

Also, please note we have the term trademarked.<br>
'''(Registration No. 5682313, No. 5682314)'''

==What Happened?==
[[File:Apology_by_AL.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Apology by Azur Lane]]
The Chinese Warship-based Character Mobile Game, "Azur Lane" had used the term '''"Kanmusu (艦娘)"''' on their lastest Advertisement. 
The Advertisement was immediately removed, and they had published an apology.

==The Term Kanmusu (艦娘) was trademarked when?==
The trademark "Kanmusu (艦娘)" was registered back in 2014 under DMM.com LABO (who owns DMM Powerchord Studio). Last week, DMM.com LABO had merged into DMM.com LLC, which could be an explanation for this action.
