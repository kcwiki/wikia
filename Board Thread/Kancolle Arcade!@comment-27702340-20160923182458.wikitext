I have been to Japan for 2 weeks for a study trip and just recently got back.

Over the course of my stay there, I managed to get some chance to play with the Kancolle Arcade.

==Requirements==
[[File:Aime_Card.jpg|thumb|Aime Card]]
In order to play the game, you will need the following:

=== Aime Card ===

* '''You can still play as Guest but your account will be deleted after you log out'''
* '''Aime card is used to save your account, aka your progress, in Kancolle Arcade'''
* '''Aime card cost 300 Yen to purchase and it can be bought from the dispenser in SEGA Arcade Buildings'''

=== 100 Yen Coins ===

* '''Putting in 1 ''"100 Yen" ''coin will give you 300 GP and a bit of res before you start playing'''
* '''Putting in 3 ''"100 Yen" ''coins will give you 900 GP and more res before you start playing'''
* '''Printing a Kanmusu Card will cost you 1 ''"100 Yen" ''coin'''


=== Kancolle Arcade Cards ===

* '''You can buy Kancolle Arcade Cards from nearby card shops and use them at the Kancolle Arcade'''

==Similarities==
[[File:KC_Arcade_Kanmusu_Get!.jpg|thumb|Kanmusu Get! in Kancolle Arcade]]

* Just like Kancolle Web Browser, you can only have 6 shipgirls in a fleet.
* There is equipment and Kanmusu construction as well.
* Quest list is present but only available after clearing World 1-4.
* You can change the furnitures in your base.
* Docks are available for you to repair your Kanmusus when they are Shouha, Chuuha or Taiha. 
* '''4 docks instead of 2'''
* You need to level your girls for them to become stronger.
* You need to craft better equipments for them to get stronger.
* You get Kanmusus via drops and construction.
* The world map in Kancolle Arcade is the same as the one in Kancolle Web Browser.

==Differences==
* You get to control your fleet movements and actions, meaning you get to dodge enemy torpedoes and shells.
* '''This is done by using the steering wheel on the Arcade Machine'''
* There is a certain range in which different Kanmusu types can fire.

* You get to control the fleet speed to determine how fast they travel.
* '''This is controlled using the Fleet Speed Control on the Arcade Machine'''
* '''Caution! Putting a Fast DD, like Shimakaze, in front will cause the rest of the ships to fall behind'''
* You need to scan the Kancolle Arcade Cards in order to use the Kanmusus in the game.
* You can only get 1 Kanmusu drop after you defeat the Boss Fleet in the sortie.
*' ''Defeating other fleets will not grant you Kanmusus as drops'''
* Fleet Formation can be changed during battle itself.
* You can spam Kanmusu's secondary guns on the Abyssals.
* '''Though this is pointless, but it is useful in attracting the Abyssal Fleet attention and dealing some minor damage to them'''
* Before launching torpedoes at the enemy, you have to choose the direction you want the torpedoes to be launched.
* Main Firing, Launching Torpedoes, Secondaries Firing and Air Attack are controlled via a button located on the Arcade Machine.

==Cons==
There is some stuff I have to warn you guys about:

* After returning from a sortie, there will be a cooldown before the game start draining your GP.
* For every 1 second spent in the home base, 1~2 GP is drained.
* Also, you can only craft 1 Kanmusu from construction per session, which means that you have to log out and play again if you want to craft another Kanmusu.
* There is also a limit to the number of times you can replenish your GP.
* There is a timer in every sortie and engaging other fleets, instead of the Boss Fleet, will drain time with '''''Night Battle '''''draining extra 20 seconds if engaged.

==Kanmusu Sinking Penalty==
Sinking a Kanmusu will give you only 3 options after returning from a sortie:
* Pay 600 GP for a Repair Goddess to fully revive her.
* Lose 1 HQ Level and reset the Kanmusu level back to 1.
* Decide later.

You have to pick either one of the 1st 2 options and they will prompt you again if you choose the 3rd option and play again.

==Rarity==
Like Kancolle Web Browser, Kanmusus are determined by their rarity and stars.
[[File:KC_Arcade_Meeting_Kanmusu.jpg|thumb|Meeting Kanmusu in Kancolle Arcade]]

This is position of how rare the cards are (sorted in descending order):

# '''Damaged CG Kai Holo Card'''
# '''Kai Holo Card'''
# '''Damaged CG Holo Card'''
# '''Holo Card'''
# '''Rainbow Background Card'''
# '''Gold Background Card'''
# '''Silver Background Card'''
# '''Light and Dark Blue Background Card'''

Please note that it is more advisable to obtain Kai Cards by playing and progressing through Kancolle Arcade.

==Kanmusu Stats==
* Using a Kai, Holo or Damaged CG Card will affect the Kanmusu Stats in the Kancolle Arcade.
* Kai Cards will increase all the stats of the Kanmusu, which is just like how remodeling Kanmusu works in Kancolle Web Browser.
* Holo Cards also increases the stats of Kanmusus, but by just a bit.
* Damaged CG Cards will increase some of the Kanmusu's stats in exchange by decreasing others.
* '''For Example, having a decrease in Armor Stats for an increase in Firepower and Torpedo Stats.'''
* Crafting Equipments in the Kancolle Arcade itself and equipping them on the Kanmusus will affect their stats as well.
* Leveling Shipgirls will also increase the Kanmusu's Stats too.

==Tips==

[[File:KC_Arcade_Rank.jpg|thumb|Getting Perfect S Rank in Kancolle Arcade]]
* CVs are not ideal yet in Kancolle Arcade and their reload time is pretty bad as well. 
* '''1 CV Reload = 2 BB Salvo'''
* Since majority of the mechanics in Kancolle Web Browser have not been implemented into Kancolle Arcade yet, it is still advisable to put 1~2 Carriers in your fleet from World 2-3 onwards.
* Advisable to get to the boss as quickly as possible.
* '''Boss Fleet can be located by the Huge Red Spot, just sail towards that direction'''
* Double Line is more favourable in Kancolle Arcade than Line Ahead.
* Buying the Starter Cards, aka non-kai versions, will make your game easier if you don't feel like having RNG and Tanaka whack you with a Salt Bucket.
