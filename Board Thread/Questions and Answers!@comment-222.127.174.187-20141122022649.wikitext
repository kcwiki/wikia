I kinda regret remodeling my SS to SSV and now I need to get her to lv.60+ for expedition and quests. 3-2A is a No-No to me since they always managed to get critted even on flaship spot with 2 enhanced steam boiler equipped and reparing them takes more than an hour. PvP seems kinda slow, same goes for Orel. So any ideas or tips?<ac_metadata title="Good grinding map for SSV?"> </ac_metadata>
