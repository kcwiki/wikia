Well, I have already bought 1000 webmoney for the Q&A giveaway, I am going to give out details. For questions: There will be 10 questions regarding my fleet, myself and kancolle knowledge(i.e. furnitures, updates, historical divisions, etc.) They're all prepared already. All questions are answered in my twitch chat, and I will be marking down people who got it right.

Each questions will have a 30 seconds of answering time. Googling, cheating behind me, w/e, is allowed. If more than 2 people have the same score, RNG decides the victorious one.

For Q1-Q4, I will try my best to give out the tips in the twitch for easier answering.

Others:

The twitch will start at 4:45 GMT+8, while the Q&A will be there starting at 5:00 GMT+8 at [http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitch.tv%2Fkololz&h=VAQFstQUgAQGrE0yMYbgLKGPusGGSNEg-A9Wac2nF1N5FFQ&enc=AZOmRbpdcjvYhUnC3YQhKGdwN_6O_1SpfaY1M-gv4jhgeArJMiIqcE6WvB-sfMgS1qARRgmiYRJXl8T4B5B-w8tY4IsznhCbRTkd8UxACocWVhPVJvGkwD42uL7aN0QlHdK3ALBUEP3SzdEAFXQEuy3xewtZeuKB3kk5lvttkTmj1Q&s=1 www.twitch.tv/kololz]
