My Kasumi is still on level 30 and no Asashimo (assuming operation Rei-Go kanmusus is required for easy brancing).

Farming List: All new kanmusus, Amagi, Shioi, Yuu, Asashimo, Asagumo, Sakawa, Katori (more akitsumaru and maruyu).

I have enough surface and air radars, but no T32 surface radar.



Is it better for me to keep stockpilling? (only sortie for dailies and weeklies) 

Or should I grind Kasumi and Maruyus? (remodel and use Maruyus for luck and opening ship slot)

Recommendation and advice is appreciated. Thanks<ac_metadata title="All Hard and Farming"> </ac_metadata>
