So i have been playing the game since roughly i think the september lottery i think it was. and i just now unlocked world 2.

I find this game to be very fun and enjoyable, but dificult. What is a good fleet formation? i have been messing with the ships i have and switching them around when i get a new one, or one thats much stronger. since i have only 3 of the 4 fleet spots unlocked i only really use my main fleet. so what i want to know is dose anyone have any advice for me? i have what i think is a really well built fleet. but since im only Lv. 8 it reflects my fleet a bit beeing low levled lol

Fleet#1: Hiyou, Furutaka, Tenryuu, Takao, Nachi, Hiei.Â 

Fleet# 2: Kinugasa, Aoba, Mogami, Houshou, Tama, Tatsuta.

I jsut need like alittlem ore adivce that i can find on the wiki, cause i couldnt find/see a guide for building a good fleet? and the rarity of the types of ships constructed cause i have been trying for a submerine and damnit i cant ever get one.<ac_metadata title="Newbie&#039;s Hard times.
