Hello, I started playing Kancolle recently, and found this wiki really helpful! But I noticed yesterday that the infoboxes on ships' pages are put there mostly via ShipInfoKai template and modules, but on several pages it's typed in the article and a template like Shipinfo is used. I assume the former is the correct way, am I right? I can change the article so that all of them have it the same way, shall I do it? (I wouldn't notice it if not the remodel level in "Build Time" field on these pages). Another question, are these infoboxes to be arranged using divs or MediaWiki tables? Boths methods are used here and I suppose one should be chosen.<ac_metadata title="Ship Infobox Template"> </ac_metadata>
