This is an attempt to gather all reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-3</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Winter 2015 Event]] comments.

Please use this template to get included in the counting
<pre>
{{Fleet
|BB|BB|CV|CA|CA|DD|
|Route = A - H - C - E
}}

'''Important Notes for Template'''
* You will have to report ship names, their levels and equipment '''separately'''. '''Do not include it into the template'''
* For compositions less than 6 ships, please still '''include the vertical bars''' | of the remaining ships.
* '''For a combined fleet mechanic, only post the first fleet!'''
* Admins and Moderators may edit or remove posts that contain template mishaps or intentional attempts to break the mechanism.

'''Other helpful data you can post'''
* HQ Level
* Equipment LoS (special formula) and Total LoS
* Formation used each node and general analysis of the node

'''Other notes'''
* Screenshots are allowed, esp enemy patterns
* Branching theories or general tips are also welcome
