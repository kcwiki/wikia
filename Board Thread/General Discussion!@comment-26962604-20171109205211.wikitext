I have been using KC3 forever and it used to work, But after I reset my pc it's no longer working for me, and it's starting to annoy me because I'll occasionally hit the go back page button and lose the exp gained from pvp or not finishing a boss fight in 6-3.

I know that the page behind the game screen should be light blue by default, not having the dmm stuff and the white page.

Help please.
