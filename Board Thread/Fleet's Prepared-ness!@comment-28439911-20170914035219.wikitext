Ok, to be honest. after remodelling my Saratoga to mod.2 and cleared the quest where I chosen F4U-1D over F6F. For another quest which rewarding a F6F, 5-5 and 6-2 for me is too hard to be cleared. Furthermore, I'm VERY conservative with my resources and this year I never touched LSC button for upcoming event.Â 

Should I get an Night Fighter ASAP before next event started, or can I skip that and focusing on recovering resources? And did I wrong to pick F4F-1D over F6F just because its rarity?<ac_metadata title="Is NF(Night Fighter) is a must for upcoming event?"> </ac_metadata>
