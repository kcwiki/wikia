Okay, I should summarize what I have been doing:

- My DMM account is registered and is linked to my facebook account (I usually log-in to the DMM site via Facebook)

- I usually log-in to new get a new API link after a week or two.

- No problems/infractions encountered/made throughout my playtime. Just this recent maintenance for Winter 2015 Event.



Problems encountered:

- If I log-in on the DMM site (JP or EN) via Facebook, I get a [http://puu.sh/fyatV/3aea99547f.png Password reset/change notice] whereas I've already did it 4 times already and it's still there every time I try to log-in on the DMM site via Facebook.

- If I log-in on the DMM site (JP to access my KanColle) using the email I used and open KanColle, I get redirected to the [http://puu.sh/fy6HJ/5e1763554e.png World/Server selection list] which in fact I shouldn't because I'm already at Palau Anchorage Server.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you.<ac_metadata title="[SOLVED] Password Reset Notice loop?"> </ac_metadata>
