Hello everyone just want a check up on my fleet to see if I woud be able to mainly do medium or if I should stick to just doing easy.  In the last event I only did easy and finished E-5 and want to see how far I can [[File:Ships1.png|thumb]]get this time.  In terms of resource I have 33k/32k/26k/18k in terms of resources.
