So starting 2 days ago, logged into DMM using the usual method of VPN to start and once I get to my port screen disconnect and run regularly. Starting then, though, I've had abysmally slow connections (regardless of which VPN I use), the game freezing when I try to resupply, sortie, or just about anything really.

The event is half over and I'm not half done with it, so I'm trying to play catch up but that's not easy when I've gone 2 days without being able to play. It runs slightly better in Chrome than in KanColleViewer, but still not perfect.

Thoughts and suggestions?<ac_metadata title="Slow connections and game freezes"> </ac_metadata>
