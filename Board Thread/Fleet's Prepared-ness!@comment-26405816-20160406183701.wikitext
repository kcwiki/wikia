Hello, I wanted to be sure that I can do the upcoming event at least on easy (possibly even on normal);

Resources:

Fuel: 30k; Ammo: 33k; Steel: 30k; Bauxite: 26k (I want to get them to at least 35k+); Buckets: 167 (I want to have at least 200+)

Fleet:

I didn't focus enough on DD's/CV(L)'s that much so I'm trying to get as many DD's as possible to a decent level (around 50-60). I'm not sure if there are enough CA(V)'s or CL's either

I'm trying to get Abukuma(Lv. 71) and Ayanami(Lv. 37) to Kai Ni; I want to bring Hiei(Lv. 16) to Lv. 65 (maybe even Kai Ni her) and maybe level up Ooshio(Lv. 12); Ooi to Lv. 90+; Ooyodo to Lv. 75; Michishio(Lv. 42) to 65+ (I get the feeling that she'll receive her Kai Ni soon) and others that aren't high-leveled.

I accept any feedback considering my ideas on leveling up ships.

Also, about equipment, I don't have much to say here because I don't have many good guns etc. (Mainly because I don't have Akashi to improve them)

Thank you for your time.[[File:021237246374345676786.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Preparations for Spring 2016 Event - Easy/Normal Mode"> </ac_metadata>
