Hey guys, so Im getting pretty deep into the franchise as a whole now (its probably my favorite fandom to be a part of) and would like to go a little further and am in need of some help choosing an art book. Like most of you, I cannot read Japanese and would like my first kancolle art book to be  a qualiy one with lots of artwork and less words. If any of you have some of the artbooks and could recommend me a good one that meets the above criteria it would be very much appreciated.

Thanks in advance<ac_metadata title="Need help choosing a Kanolle Artbook"> </ac_metadata>
