So, before anyone decides that it would be useful to tell me that they are useless and not to bother wasting time asking this, I DO know that they are significantly weaker then other light cruisers because they can't do artillery spotting. I had a sudden curiosity on what equipment they would use to be actually semi-useful in day battle instead of trapping them into expeditions or ASW mules.<ac_metadata title="Tenryuu-Class and Yuubari Day Battle Equipment Setup"> </ac_metadata>
