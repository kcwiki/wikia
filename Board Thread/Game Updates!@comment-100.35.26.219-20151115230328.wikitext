So, it seems like the game is dominated by Imperial Japanese Ships. Literally. And I don't think I'm the first to raise this issue, but what about the British Royal Navy and the United States Pacific Fleet? (Nobody ever thinks about the US Atlantic Fleet, so screw them)

Is it really that hard to add a handful of Fletcher class destroyers, around two Baltimore class cruisers, one or two Iowa class battleships, and at least the Enterprise? And for Britain, come on, just no. There is literally an ocean's worth of ships to choose from. Renown? Warspite? Nelson? Rodney? HOOD? Ringing a bell in there, developers??? <ac_metadata title="Other countries" related_topics="Suggestion" lastmove="1447630747"> </ac_metadata>
