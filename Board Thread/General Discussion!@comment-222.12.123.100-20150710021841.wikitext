Hi All Admirals,

Just started this game a month ago, currently i'm facing an issue unable to access my game after pressing "game start" on main page.  Used to be accessing my account via API link and VPN now both showing me floating ship..... 

things that i have try troubleshooting;

-try logging in game using 3 different internet connections

-using KC3 logging in game

is there anything i missed out or could it be something happen to the server シヨートランド i'm at?

Apperciate any kind advise given, thank you in advance!<ac_metadata title="unable to connect in game"> </ac_metadata>
