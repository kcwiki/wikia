can we discuss 'bout how bad my fleet at this moment?

<span style="font-size:13px;">let start with some point 1st ;</span>

<span style="font-size:13px;">- the one that i give red mark, when the times comes maybe i'll scrap or use them for modernization such as ; the quest done, getting the equipments, or leveling in 3-2A.</span>

<span style="font-size:13px;">- for ships, due to slot issue, i want to manage what ship i should save and what should i keep for a while until the times come. can i ask what ship should i add again for future use? i'm regret scrapping kami ranger-class cause that yellow ranger would show up this fast, when i know it would came this fast maybe i'll save them expedition slave only like mutsuki-class. forget 'bout that, my target was searching another akizuki-class again, warspite, iowa, unryuu-class, and etc. last event i cant manage to get teruzuki, warspite, prinz even my total farming runs over 600 times, the exact number 698 dont ask 'bout the resource i spend -_-, but i'm not gave up there was always chance in the future. for another class is there any ship should i add again? for example i add yahagi for another CL, dont know why seems i'm not interested leveling jintsuu and etc.</span>

- for equipments, due to limited screw, now i'm slowly improving 2 DLC for DLC-tank, and another SPF from Ro.43 seaplane, my regret was randomly improving some of 20.3cm(2), i thought i can get spare 20.3cm(3) from improving them, but when i think again the time i spent for collecting screw and wanna trying leveling ashigara again i'm sure i made a mistake here. for now i'm slowly leveling duo dragon getting their equipments, and for these past months...years of course i'm trying to craft AP Shell, Radar, T0 Obs, and etc. as you can see i'm still lack of them. anyway, is there any specific advice for me for the improvement equipments? or my planning to get equipments such i said above it's right on the feels?

- for choosing difficulty on event, usually i'm just running on all easy cause i wanna farm it later. due to RL and lack of time playing, for sure i want to know how far i can push my fate to face choosing the difficulty on event? of course i cant face all hard cause i'm still scrub right now. hhaha

thanks for answering my silly question guys.[[File:14922b21-a7b9-4202-ae11-6be324ec229d.jpg|thumb]][[File:28d9a09d-29bf-48c0-a622-4046838bc150.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Need advice for the future"> </ac_metadata>
