Greetings, I wanted to ask how and if i can open a wiki kancolle translated into Italian.

If possible I wanted to know if I had to ask for permission and a possible collaboration and various tips, I never created a wiki, and I do not know well what kind of programming language to use.




Thank you in advance for the help<ac_metadata title="Help translate the wiki in Italian: info"> </ac_metadata>
