So I've been working on a KanColle fangame for a bit now, progress has been coming along smoothly, and I thought it would be nice to get the word out about it. I was told that the wikia would be a good place to start, but I'm not really sure where an appropriate place to put it would be, even in the forums section. I figured what with all the doujin manga and music thats come out there'd be a section for fan-works by now, am I just missing it?<ac_metadata title="Fan Derived Works Section?"> </ac_metadata>
