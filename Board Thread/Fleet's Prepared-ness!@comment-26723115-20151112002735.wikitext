hey there i'm here back again.

a month ago i asked how my fleet looked (my fleet looked like this back then : http://i.imgur.com/JjM6UhQ.png )

i got useful info from you guys and tried to work towards that. now my fleet looks like this http://i.imgur.com/oEyz4RC.png and i'm currently leveling abukuma to kai ni  and bringing ooyodo to kai .

so did i make good improvement in this month?

would this fleet be ready for a mix of medium early maps and easy late maps?( i'm going to take it slow and wait for veterans with info for map branching etc.)

and i thank you for your time to look at my fleet once again<ac_metadata title="back again for a last check up"> </ac_metadata>
