[[File:Fleet_Fall_1.jpg|thumb]]Sadly, getting enough screws to make a 10cmHA/AAFD is impossible at the moment, but I feel the rest of my fleet is in "OK" shape.  I know I need to modernize alot of ships, but other than that, anything else that may need working on?  Do I have any chance at Medium or Hard?  Sitting at 20k/25k/20k/10k/189 for Fuel/Ammo/Steel/Baux/Buckets.  <ac_metadata title="Is my Fleet ready for the Fall Event on Medium?"> </ac_metadata>
