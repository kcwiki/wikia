hello, I'm fairly new to this game, I'm sorry if I'm asking such a stupid question but, my expedition team for 1-5 kept on failing. I brought 1 CL as flagship Lv.8, 2 DDs that are both Lv. 9 and 1 CA Lv. 5. I'm not sure if I'm not suppose to bring the CA as the requirements page wrote 1 XX, I would like to know if I needed to remove the CA to succeed in the expedition and if I needed to refill their fuels completely before going out. Thanks in advance !<ac_metadata title="I kept failing expedition 1-5, help?"> </ac_metadata>
