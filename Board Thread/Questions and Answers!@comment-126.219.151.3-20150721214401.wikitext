Hello,

I used KCV without any hassle for more than a year, but suddenly it gives me a white screen when logging in. This problem vanishes when I additionally connect to a Softether relay server. I deleted cookies/cleared the cache and reenabled the region cookie, but no difference. Did anyone have that kind of problem yet? Thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="Kancolle Viewer - Sudden White Screen Problem"> </ac_metadata>
