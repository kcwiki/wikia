My main goal is to just clear the event and wherever possible maybe do some farming. My time won't allow much due to school coming up.

Due to the experience in Fall 2015, I started levelling my DD's and CL's up to the point they're acceptable, with Bucky, Shigure, Sendai and Jintsuu all now Kai Ni. I'm pretty aware Kasumi and Ashigara are also needed for Winter, so I'm levelling as much as I can.

BB's and CV(L)'s are ok for Easy standard, but I do question about their ability to handle normal. The CA's however are in very poor shape and I really need them levelled up, but I simply have no place for them to level. Only Choukai and maybe Aoba are considered ready for combat.

Resources are enough for clearing and moderate farming, though I don't have enough time and buckets for extensive farming, so unless I'm in luck, new ships are out of the question.
