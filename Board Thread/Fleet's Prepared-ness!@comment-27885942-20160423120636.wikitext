Hello, this is my 2nd event and I didn't think I gained much experience from the last one, so somehow I feel very nervous.Â 

So I'm looking forward to your advice about which ship I need to train more and which equipment I should get. About my resources, yeah I think they are not enough for Hard anyway...

Thank you[[File:Hell_yeah.png|thumb]][[File:Another_hell_yeah.png|thumb]][[File:Another_hell_yeah1.png|thumb]][[File:Another_hell_yeah2.png|thumb]][[File:Another_hell_yeah3.png|thumb]][[File:Another_hell_yeah4.png|thumb]][[File:Another_hell_yeah5.png|thumb]][[File:Another_hell_yeah6.png|thumb]].<ac_metadata title="Is my fleet ready for all medium and which ship I need to train more?"> </ac_metadata>
