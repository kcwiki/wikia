Hi guys , i play Kantai since 11 Month, this summer event will come with 1 year of play.

Atm i have 42k Fuel , 39k Ammo, 85k Iron, 57k Bauxite , 920 bucket surely i will make more and need more for the event

So, now for the next month i wanna ask advice on what to do , and what not. I still need to level some ship and i cant let weekly/Montly Screw , PvP exp go to waste

My plan is to go Normal and Hard in some Map , all based on drop and reward

Here My stuffÂ
