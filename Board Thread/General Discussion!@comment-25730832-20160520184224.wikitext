'''LBAS-Interceptor Theory [AKA Duckceptor] '''

'''- Crackpot-who-thought-of-it: '''[[User:Fujihita]]

There are two theories being tackled right now: the possibility that interceptors , when equipped onto the 1st slot (or any other slots; explanation below) of a [[LBAS]] Base set to "Sortie" can help reduce incoming Air-base damages.

Some images can be seen here: http://imgur.com/a/IX7Sm

Regarding 1st slot, it was noticed that the 1st slot of the base is usually the slot that receives the most plane lost.

'''Super WG42-Kami Theory [AKA One Punch Kasumi]''' 

'''- Crackpot-who-thought-of-it: '''[[User:DynamitMC]]

Using WG42 x 2 + Tank (Ka-mi(?)) can inflict high damage against E7 boss even though it's not useful against its E6 form. Said equipment can be equipped on any Tank carriers (e.g. Kasumi, Ooshio).
