So in preparation of the event, I started grinding, and started to pain myself over whether I'll be able to clear this event or not. I was then referred to this forum board, and decided to post my fleet here. I am planning to run Medium for the first map (my friends say I have a pretty stable light fleet), then run Easy/Medium, depending on shiplocking, difficulty, and my sanity level for the rest of the event.

'''Here is my fleet:'''

DD: Yuudachi K2 (75), Verniy (73), Shigure K2 (65), Fubuki K (69, this frustrates me :(>.<):), Akatsuki K (53), and 2 others at level 45-50.

CL(T): Isuzu K2 (60), Sendai K (59, again, this frustrates me), Abukuma K (49), Kitakami K2 (78), Ooi K2 (69)

CA(V): Kumano K (48), Suzuya K (38), I'm really lacking in CA(V)'s...

BB(V): Ise K (71), Kongou (74), Haruna (60), Yamashiro K (40), Fusou K (23), Hyuuga K (43), I can't find any good BB...

SS: I-8 K (43), I-58 (45), I-168 (23), I blame RNG for not giving me better subs
