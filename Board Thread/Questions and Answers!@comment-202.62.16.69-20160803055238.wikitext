Hi TTKs

Around one or two weeks ago i tried to play KC, but when i login the page redirects me to the password reset notice, i entered my DMM registered email then wait for the mail from DMM, but the mail doesnt sent to me and i tried to use my diffrent email, then it works. When i hit the link and put my new password, then i tried login again and the page redirect me to the password notice again, i tried around dozens of time but its still do the same, tried to clear my cache, cookies, set cache, change VPN, switch ISP, etc. Does anyone knows how to solve this ? I havent been logging in around 2 months, and if this help, i live in Indonesia ATM
