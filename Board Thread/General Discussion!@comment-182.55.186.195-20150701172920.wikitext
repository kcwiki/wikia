I just reformatted my PC after a needing of replacement parts, and installed Win 7 Professional. Did all the IE 11/ Adobe/.netframework 4.5.2 installations. 



When i tried the API link method for KCV, all it gives me is Error cat the moment I press the start button, Cleared cache plenty of times too on both KCv and IE.

Tested the same thing on IE 11 ( as a suggestion to try) and it gives me the same error. Chrome has no issue tho, although using Kc3kai doesn't show up with the admiral console. 

Any suggestions on what i need done to solve the KCV issue, at the very least? I'm seriously confused as to why this error is occuring now<ac_metadata title="Browser(IE)/ KCV showing error cat."> </ac_metadata>
