I have played Kancolle for about a few months now, the only 3rd party software i used was KCV (Kancolle Viewer). I admit i did refresh from time to time (Usually 5-8 times when doing daylies or going to wrong node). but apart from that i did not use hacks/cheat, though i did leave my computer on with KCV overnight. haven't spent anything on the game yet
