'''Guidelines for citing sources.'''

Hello everyone! Sorry to reach out to you this way.

It has come to our attention that a lot of contributions onto the event pages have largely had no sources and lead to conflicting edits amongst our users and staff alike, leading to others deleting them back and forth due to this.

The ideal guidelines for preventing this is to cite your sources in order to verify the credibility of your claims, such as adding a link to an image or video right after a statement. For example:
"Having 3CL + 2DD + 1CVL will lead you to mid-route in E-1, note that your fleet has to be a fast fleet [https://puu.sh/qyNYh/ee26d56d21.jpg]"

Putting links or images between brackets [] is good enough, some more advanced users make use of footnotes that lead you to the References section first, but this is not of any concern.

It simply saddens me to see our user's contributions being deleted because they lack any sources to back them up. In the case you do not have any sources that is available online, such as Discord/Teamspeak voice chat confirmations, your own witnessing of something etc. leave an edit summary stating so, such as "Discord/Teamspeak voice chat". Remember, you want to convince others of what you say is true and you must provide some evidence to back it up.

Without further ado, thank you for your time and good luck and fair seas throughout the event!
