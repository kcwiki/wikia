Hello everyone,

I'm playing Kancolle exclusively on Android since August 2017, and I wonder if there is a way to share the fleet & equipment you have like the players who plays with a browser ? I'm not really used of all the mecanics and priorities to do in this game and when I see the "fleet prepared-ness" section I was thinking about taking advices about it too, but since i'm playing on my phone I dunno how to do it.

If there is something like KC3 to take screens of your fleet or something like this for phone, or a website where u can check your own stats (like you have on plenty of online games).

(I would also thanks everyone here sharing the informations about this game, if this Wiki wasnt there i wouldnt have played this game at this moment !)<ac_metadata title="Question about devices to share fleet &amp; equipment on Android"> </ac_metadata>
