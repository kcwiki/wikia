Hi everyone, I just noticed this discrepancy when I newly Kai Ni-ed my Haruna and noticed that my base stats do not match that of this wikia's, but that of the wikiwiki.jpn.

Then I realised that stats: are shown as   x(y) 

where

x = stats inside the ingame shipbook/dex/encyclopedia

y = max stats

Should we have some kind of note written somewhere to outline this? Should we come up with some way to include the base in-game stats of the shipdaughter after upgrade? Currently it's very confusing.<ac_metadata title="Regarding stats of shipdaughters"> </ac_metadata>
