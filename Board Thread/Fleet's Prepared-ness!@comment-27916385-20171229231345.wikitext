hello again,

after a longer absence from the game because of school I have finally found the time and energy to to play. The last time I played was over a half year ago. I haven't played neither the summer nor the fall event so I am lacking not only the rewards but also the knowledge of the newly implemented game mechanics.

My goal is of course a full clear of the winter event in easy and maybe medium depending on the maps. Apart from that I would love to enhance my whole fleet and its performance overall.

My current resources are 20k/19k/19k/21k and I own exactly 300 buckets. Next month I should be able to obtain a blueprint, my two candidates would be Sara or Nagato.

I am looking forward to your replies and hope you have a nice day :)
