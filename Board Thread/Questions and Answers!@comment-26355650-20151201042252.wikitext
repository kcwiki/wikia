<p style="font-weight:normal;">So I am here on E-3 Easy, farming for Akizuki. I haven't took count of my runs, but it is sure to be somewhere around 30-50 runs. Yes, these are a few runs as compared to some admirals, but other than obtaining Akizuki, I also want to get the first class medal from this event. But the limited time left might make it not possible, so I am in need of some advice and suggestions...</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Should I clear E-3 on easy, then medium on E-4 and hard on E-5, altogether ignoring the type 4 sonar and the German reppuu, and after E-5 go back to E-3 and farm? Or should I take time on E-3 and wait until I get Akizuki, then go hard?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Also, with the limited time remaining, is it possible to use full supports in case I want to clear E-5 on hard (just to increase the chances of clearing the map)?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">(Also planning to farm for German ships at E-4 if I still have the time...is E-4 medium farmable?)</p> <ac_metadata title="Can I still get Akizuki *AND* clear the event *ON HARD*...?" related_topics="Fall 2015 Event" lastmove="1452420229"> </ac_metadata>
