Just wondering if I can do a full clear of easy + 1 or 2 medium maps(depending on special drops or not)

The fleet is nothing to write home about. Needs CAs, DDs and CLs badly. Most of the ships are in the lvl 30-20 range. My main goal for this event is to get rare construction ships since I would save up more resources that way ( plus I do have a lot of luck when it comes to RNG aka I got Yukikaze w/o actually having to farm 4 her ). Currently I'm leveling some more CAs in 3-2A as well as Jun'you for the reppu.Â
