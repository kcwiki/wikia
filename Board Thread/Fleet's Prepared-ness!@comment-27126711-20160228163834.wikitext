I'm a fairly new TTK (been playing for less than a year) who has cleared two events (including Winter 2016) on Easy and am considering taking up a notch since I found farming for the ships I want on Easy isn't going that well (Isokaze pls).

Currently, this is what I have:

What I plan to do:
* '''BB:''' I think with a little bit of leveling Mutsu's okay. Probably getting Nagato as well. Just to make sure.
* '''fBB:''' K2 order would be Kirishima, Kongou, Hiei, Haruna.
* '''BBV:''' Unsure whether to level Ise (or Hyuuga) since I already have Fusou sisters nearing K2 level. I have limited BP's though.
* '''CV:''' K2 order would be cranes first, dragons probably later.
* '''CVL:''' I've heard Jun'you K2 is really good, so I'd put her on priority first. Then probably ChitoChiyo K2 or Ryuujou K2.
* '''CA:''' K2 order would probably be Haguro, Myoukou, Nachi, then Maya. (Or should I put Maya first?)
* '''CAV:''' I think the revised Mogamis are already okay, so I should probably get 1 Tone-class to K2. Only one because limited BP's.
* '''CL:''' Is 6 okay? I'm suspecting Spring 2016 would be a large-scale event so I'm afraid I might run out of properly leveled ships to deploy. I have an Abukuma as well.
* '''CLT:''' Kiso K2, then Ooi K2.
* '''DD:''' They need a lot of things.
** Akatsuki, Fubuki, and Hibiki K2's.
** For large scale events you'd need at least 12 DD's. So far I have only 7 ships with level 50 and above.
** I have an Amatsukaze, Shimakaze, Ayanami and Hatsuzuki as well, just in case.
* '''SS:''' They're okay.
* '''AV:''' Should I level ChitoChiyo AV's as well?
* '''Ships I need to get:''' Akitsu Maru. Because you'll never know when you'll encounter a map that needs AS but doesn't allow carriers.

What do you think? Should these be enough?<ac_metadata title="Second opinions and advice for a Easy/Normal mixed event run"> </ac_metadata>
