So I've heard a few times that having either even numbered health, or a number that's a multiple of four is a bad thing, as how damage is worked out it's more likely to round up to an even number and hurt more.

Yet, I've not actually seen anything about that on this wikia or the wiki, so how much difference does it really make? Should I mod ships to max health or leave them on an odd number?<ac_metadata title="Even/4x health stat negative effect?"> </ac_metadata>
