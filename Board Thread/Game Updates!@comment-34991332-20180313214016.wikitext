Why don't they just put each Ship with their own drop rates for the Random number generator in when players are doing sorties.

I would also like to see all the event ships being able to be dropped on regular sorties for those who don't know how to access the events.  

I think that a good idea for the construction of new ships is that individual ship girl should have their own unique recipe instead of having to rely on the random number generator hoping that you get the ship you want.

I think these Ideas would stop alot of griping from those that play the game when they can't get the ship the want despite their neumorous attempts to get that specific ship.  <ac_metadata title="Future Ideas for the game." lastmove="1521067026"> </ac_metadata>
