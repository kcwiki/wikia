Hi everyone, new Admiral here.

Firstly, thank you everyone for making this wonderful wikia site. It really helps newbies like me. I especially want to thank Shinwalee for making the awesome Event Guide which is like a bible for me.

I think my fleet/resources/basic requirement is almost met because of this.

I have some questions.

1) I have only cleared map 3.1 (spamming 3.2A. Not clearing other maps to manage resources). Will this be a problem for the Spring Event?

2) I have not unlocked Support Expedition 34. It shows I can do Support Expedition 33. Wikia says I can only do these Support Expedtion in World Map 5. Must I unlock them or just wait until the Spring Event?

3) I don't have Akashi so I only have the basic Fubuki Kai Ni gear. How to set-up Fubuki Kai Ni effectively since I don't have the best AACI best in slot gear?
