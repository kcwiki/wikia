[[File:Ggjutyu.jpg|thumb]]Hi guyz, atm im a bit scared about the event so im going to ask you some advice about who i need to level before the event start. Im levelling: Chiyoda/Chitose kai ni, Kisaragi, Kirishima and Nachi. I was thinking about power levelling Murasame but i don't know, maybe another dd is better (like Yukikaze maybe)? Atm i have 52k / 46k / 38k / 34k / 538+Â  how many resources should i aim? And last thing: after i'll use a blueprint on Zuikaku, who i should remodel with a blueprint? My kokoro is telling me Nagato, cuz i love her, but maybe a CAV is better? (Even if my cav are very low, lol) thanks and sorry for my English, i did my best.<ac_metadata title="Need tips for the Event (Easy mode)"> </ac_metadata>
