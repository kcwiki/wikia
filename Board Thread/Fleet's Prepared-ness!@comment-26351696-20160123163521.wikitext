Sorry, I shouldn't ask but I am stocking up but my ships want to get beans thrown by Hoppo... then they realise it was not beans that thrown by her but shells, planes... 10 runs with last dance alone and still counting.... I think something is wrong.

Is there anything wrong with this composition? or should I try to another one or another route... or patience is the solution? I did sparkle them to 60. Do I need to sparkle them to 85?

with new planes machanics, air power is now 394-409 (shown in KC3Kai panel)
