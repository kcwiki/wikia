[[File:Fusou_bug.jpg|thumb]]After the October 30th update, I can no longer sortie my Fusou Kai. Her image shows up as blank and when I try to send her into battle the game would stall at the loading part after you select battle formation. Anyone know how to fix this issue?<ac_metadata title="empty image bug"> </ac_metadata>
