I've just started 3 days ago and I am starting to lack fuel and ammo for sorties, even if I didn't build any ships. What can I do to replenish these resources?Â 

Should I just wait for several hours, or do some quests that can result in a net gain?<ac_metadata title="Lacking of resources"> </ac_metadata>
