Seems like there's been some complaints of anti-american sentiment for a while and since the anime aired its heated up a bit more. I didn't think much of it, but after they did their revisionist history on midway it started to seem fishier. So, have they ever given an official reason? They do them selves a lot of favors if they added just one. <ac_metadata title="Has Kadokawa ever given an official reason why they don&#039;t have any American ships?" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
