Whenever I paste my API link into the brower the same prompt about downloading Main2d.swf comes up. If I download it, it's just a useless file that I can't run because I don't have the necessaru program. If I choose to cancel, it brings me back to the DMM page. Any help?<ac_metadata title="API Link Main2D.swf Download prompt?"> </ac_metadata>
