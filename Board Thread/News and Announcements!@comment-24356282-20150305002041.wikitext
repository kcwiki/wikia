Hello everyone.  It appears as though we've had a few cases of our users being IP banned from the Kancolle Wiki by the VSTF. If you, or someone you know has had this happen to them, please have them contact one our admins or chat moderators through either wiki chat or skype so we can notify the appropriate authorities to have this resolved as quickly as possible.
