I've tried refreshing my API link, disabling KC3, clearing my cache, using another browser, but none of my EO boss meters have reset yet. For some reason, though, 1-5 appears without the boss meter but 1-6 hasn't been unlocked. Has anyone got a fix for this? :/ Thanks!Â <ac_metadata title="EO boss meters haven&#039;t reset"> </ac_metadata>
