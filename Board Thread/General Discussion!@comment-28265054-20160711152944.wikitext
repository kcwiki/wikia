Hi fellow Admirals

Wanna Ask about Saving resource for the event while u can still grind at 3-2A / 4-3

i already try the tips at http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Shinhwalee/Major_Event_Preparation_Guide_for_Admirals

but seems to have work a little to me.

preferrable if i just Switch to just full Farming resource Mode for amount of time then go back to full grind or just Hybrid ?Â
