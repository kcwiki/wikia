It's about time we go places TTKs. Here are two questions that most probably hold the answer to life itself:

1. Why do admirals tend to flock to the Battleships? I mean, I know cute loli DD waifus got their fair share of fans too. However they tend to fall short when you compare them to Haruna and Kongou fans which arguably can establish a small country. And don't get me started on Yamato, Nagato, or Bismarck.

2. Why do Kai Nis always have a much better arts than their previous form? Is it because historically they get significantly stronger or anything? Case and point: Yuudachi from cute to hawt, Jintsuu from bleh to samurai, Kiso from-- well she always was a badass but dat Kai Ni though. Even Abukuma's Kai Ni made me forgive her voice! And that's saying something.<ac_metadata title="(Un)important Questions"> </ac_metadata>
