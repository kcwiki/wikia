Hello! Lv.50 TTK reporting! 1st of all, sorry if my english it's a bit basic-weird ><;;<br />I want to know if I can make something with my actual ships in the current event,<br />it's my 1st time entering one, I appreciate any kind of help ;v;<br />I want to get '''Kawakaze '''or '''Umikaze '''(I love Shiratsuyu class!),<br />but I don't know if I can make it to, at least, E-2? (Easy (0 hopes for any Medium map)),<br />also, how should I organize the fleets? + should I train them a bit more? (intensive 3-2A lol)
