Would anyone happen to know what is needed for the verification, I am thinking about buying a recycled Japanese phone number from online apps like hushed and burner for a month, or I'll even try searching for a free Japanese sms receiver online. Do they use a sms text verification? Am I required to verify the number everytime I exchange the pinball points?

And a rhetorical question, how likely am I to be banned for using a virutal phone number?<ac_metadata title="The free Dmm pinball points that need phone number verification."> </ac_metadata>
