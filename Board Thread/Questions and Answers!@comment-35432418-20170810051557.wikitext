Hello there :).

This'll be my first Event run, the forum and the wiki pages "got me" ready for it, but I want some personal insight from you, more experienced teitokus :).

Should I keep sending fleets for expedition? Or should I always keep 1-2 fleets for boss and pre-boss support expedition?

And, you guys normally spend 100% of the logged in time just "smashing" the E-Maps until you're out of resources? My wishlist for this event, is focused entirely in farming those unbuidable and undroppable kanmusus :3.

About "getting banned". What else should I be worried about, if not for;

1-Using third party softwares. I only use KC3, after searching, I never found anyone who got banned for it.

2-Refreshing in-sortie like a maniac. I refresh in-sortie, let's say, 2-6 times per week, is that dangerous?

3-Pre-sets Akashi repair exploit.

And, my last point is: I spent U$50,00-60,00 in-game. By, spending money in game "turns me" into a "less threatened bannable teitoku"? Even not being a Japanese citizen? Of course, never cheating or using fishy and straight out illicit softwares/bots.

Thanks for your time/reply :). Let's all soteki no party hajimashou!.<ac_metadata title="Event"> </ac_metadata>
