Just out of curiosity, while looking at the server ranking i started wondering how many players on average are on one server ?

I tried looking around, spending some time on google but didn't find any semi relevent information.

Now it's not like i want to know the exact amount of players on every server but just have a vague general idea of how many active players are on your average server.

I don't care much about ranking, but when i see i'm say rank 500 i just kinda think, ok yeah but 500 of how many ? 500 out of 50000 eh not bad, 500 out of 5000 meh, kinda like that.

Any idea ?<ac_metadata title="Server population ?"> </ac_metadata>
