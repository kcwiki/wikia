After being highly frustrated by my own casualness and having to scrape by (by one day) an easy clear during the spring event, I've been powerleveling like mad to ensure I don't have the same problems with Summer.

In saying this, I've still got a lot of work, I know, to do on my DDs and CLs. My thoughts are as follows;

BB: No problems here. Haruna K2, Kirishima K2, Kongou mid 50s, Musashi Mid 50s, Mutsu nearly 80, should have Fusou to K2 from 3-2A leeching before event. May look at pushing Littorio to Roma before event.

CA: Thanks to bulk leveling, little issue here either. Ashigara K2, Haguro K2, Maya K2, should have Furutaka to K2 this week. Not sure who to work on next, probably Nachi or Myouko. 

CV/CVL: Probably OK. Akagi, Kaga, Zuikaku, Shokaku all 40-50. Jun'you K2, Chiyoda K2. Probably have Ryuujou at K2 too from 3-2A leech. 

CL: Eh. Just Eh. Lots of work to do. Kiso to K2 (Although CLT). Jintsuu to K2. Melon and Ooyodo are OK for now, Yasen-chan too. Not sure who to prioritze.

DD: Lots of work to be done here too, although a lot harder to do than CL or heavier to MVP. Thoughts on how to and who to level appreciated. List attached. Thanks!
