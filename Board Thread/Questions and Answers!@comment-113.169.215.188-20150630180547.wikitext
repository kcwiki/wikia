I was so stupid that I remodeled a level 51 Goya to SSV after I had got a new Goya for 3-2 tank. SSV take double time to repair and eat more res. I can't let her go 2-3 farming and 3-2 tanking anymore. But I want to level her, so any resolution for this big mistake of me?<ac_metadata title="SSV Leveling???"> </ac_metadata>
