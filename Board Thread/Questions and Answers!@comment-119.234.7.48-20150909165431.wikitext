Since it's post-event, I was thinking of keeping resources under soft-cap and using the daily resources to lsc. So far I'm lacking these notable drops: Musashi, Bismarck, Taihou, Shioi, hundreds of Maruyus (luck fodder). Which should I LSC for? Oh and I'm lacking Hiryuu too if she is important :x (possible craft from taihou's recipe?).<ac_metadata title="What to LSC?"> </ac_metadata>
