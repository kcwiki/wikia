I don't really know what I'm doing... I understand most of the game, but I dont understand the ship/gun combos to use.

Here is my ship list. Any tips on what I can do? Any help is appreciated.

I would love to be able to do anything in the events, but I've only tried grinding e-1...<ac_metadata title="I need help"> </ac_metadata>
