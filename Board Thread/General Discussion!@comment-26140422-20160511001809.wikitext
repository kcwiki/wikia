Okay, here comes a kinda dumb question. I noticed that Hatsuyuki (and probably other ships as well) has two different introduction lines with one of them having a "(Kai)" behind it. My question is: When is this line played? As far as I know the introduction only plays when the ship is dropped. And a ship can't possibly drop already Kai'd, can it? So can someone please tell me where my train of thought went off track?<ac_metadata title="Introduction lines (Kai)"> </ac_metadata>
