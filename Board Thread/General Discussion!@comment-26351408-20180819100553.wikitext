With update to HTML5. KanColle consume a lot RAM of my laptop which had only 2 GB RAM! I used Acer Aspire 4741 old version so i can't upgrade my RAM because they welded everything together! I can't save my money to buy a new one, my salary is low only 5$/day (150$/month - in my country is not bad but gears cost are so damn high), my dad passed 1 year ago so i am main income to my mom (55 yearolds). I work everydays (Mon - Sun, 10AM - 8PM, holidays are work too), KanColle is all i have to relax, enjoy fun with. Now with HTML5 upgrade i can't play anymore, i began game and got lag, freeze and got Blue Screen!!!! Bye bye<ac_metadata title="Bye bye KanColle! It is 4,5 years we had along with!
