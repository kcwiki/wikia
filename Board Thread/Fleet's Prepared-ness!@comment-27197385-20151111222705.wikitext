Hi, this is my second event and I'm hoping to be able to go for hard for at least E1/E2 and medium for the rest of the maps. In Summer 2015 event, I could only clear up until E6, all in easy, and I want to clear all the maps this time.

HQ lv: 96

Fuel/Ammo/Steel/Bauxite: 38k/38k/39k/25k (planning to stockpile to 45k for F/A/S and 30k for baux)

Buckets: 327

After hearing that high level DD and CL will be important, I started training Ayanami (lv 39 currently), Akatsuki (lv 35) and Yuubari (lv 35). I'm planning to have Ayanami and Akatsuki reach K2 before the event.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!
