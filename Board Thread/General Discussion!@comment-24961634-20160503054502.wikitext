Approximately 1330 JST time, DMM went down. All users wont be able to log in via DMM and unable to play Kantai Collection.

Anyone who is still playing (via Kc3kai or any viewer) will be fine until you refresh the page.

So far no tweet from the official regarding this issues. DMM recovery ETA is not known. Please be patient  <ac_metadata title="DMM server went down"> </ac_metadata>
