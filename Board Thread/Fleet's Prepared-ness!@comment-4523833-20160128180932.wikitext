Pretty new admiral here not sure exactly where I need to go from here to get ready. Resources are roughly 20k/25k/20k/18k with 270 buckets. I'm not sure if it's worth burning resources to try crafting a 2nd CV or just keep hitting 2-2 for boss clear daily and pray for kaga. Also unsure if I should push for HQ80 just in case there is an easy drop to get on hard however my HQ is probably inflated already from 1-5 boss farming for subs.



I plan to craft for shells and focus on levelling Sendai and Fuubuki via 1-5. I do have a good deal of time to sink into the game until the event so any advice is welcome.



Weak points

-Sendai\Night gear     -Moderization     -Lacking CVs     -CA\DD levels     -Shells     -Low Reppuu\Ryuusei
