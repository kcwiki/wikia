Okay folks! We're glad to inform you that the revamp project for Expedition page has reached the final stage. We're basically ready to replace the old [[Expedition]] page with [[Sandbox/Expedition|this brand new expedition page]] and [[Sandbox/Expedition/Tables|this new expedition reference tables page]].

But, since we're well aware of the significance of this page. We're going to ask for inputs from other people and make adjustment before we wrap up the project. We'll be gathering suggestions/concerns about the new page in one week before the official release. Visit the pages and give your opinion in the comments.

Thank you for your time.
