I'm running out of room for new ships, and I can't afford for the moment another slot expansion (ndt. for reasons) but I still need some drops for the event.

Most of my ships are either Kai-ni or level 50+, this leaves me only with around 20 ships, like Yuugumo, Kazagumo, Makigumo, Hamakaze, Urakaze (well you get the gist of it)

Now, i your opinion, which ones should I keep and which ones should I bring to Kai and scrap/use as mod material since they are mostly trophy DD?<ac_metadata title="Kaze&#039;s and Gumo&#039;s" related_topics="General Discussion"> </ac_metadata>
