If you want to drop and/or farm Roma at E-6, several nodes have her as a potential drop, most notably Node K immediately after the Anchorage Water Demon at Node H. However, the Anchorage Water Demon is notorious for wrecking just about any surface ship in the game.

This is a potential solution to the problem by utilzing the submarine tanking method from E5:

-Put 2 SS in your fleet, one in the 1st Fleet, one in the 2nd Fleet (they can't be flagships, or else you can't form the Combined Fleet)

-Use a Carrier Task Force (this helps to eliminate all the enemies that pose an actual threat to the subs)

-NOTE: This composition is NOT a good idea for reaching the boss node, since CV Hime at the preboss node will probably wreck your CVs.



Essentially, you want to have 1 or 2 Air Superiority Fighters (Reppu or Reppu variants recommended) per CV, and fill the rest of the slots with Torpedo Bombers. The CVs should eliminate the enemy DDs with their opening air strike. If you put in CLTs, they can also help eliminate the DDs. If you do this correctly, the results for Node H (Anchorage node) should look something like this:

*Notice how the submarines have taken 1 point of damage apiece. This is because the Anchorage Water Demon was forced to attack them.
*We are not responsible for any heavy damage due to the opening air strike. However, high AA ships such as Maya or Akizuki with AACI can help to mitigate damage from Anchorage Water Demon's planes. The Fleet Command Facility (from Ooyodo Kai) can also make these runs easier in case of a heavy damage freak accident.
*After examining runs done by other players, it seems you can substitute the CVs with CVLs and the BBs with CA(V)s to reduce resource consumption. However, make sure these ships are at a sufficiently high level to deal with the enemies on Node K Hard Mode.

After this, just go to Node K and finish that battle with an easy S-Rank. If you're lucky, you might get Roma! After that, just head home (unless you want to try your luck with CV Hime).

'''PROS'''

-Simple and effective method to bypass Node H to farm at Node K

-Submarines are dirt cheap to supply and repair

-CV Combined Fleet+CLTs will wreck Anchorage's planes and destroy enemy DDs that threaten the subs

-No need to go through dangerous CV Hime and BB Oni nodes, just go home after Node K



'''CONS'''

-Doesn't guarantee complete destruction of Anchorage's bombers during Opening Air Strike (can easily be mitigated with more Fighter planes/AACI)

-Farming at Node K is only 1.5% chance of Roma drop, compared to Boss Node's 3%

-Subs provide no AA, so proceeding to the CV Hime preboss after Node K is almost suicidal

-Roma apparently only drops on Hard Mode for Node K, so keep that in mind (subs still make Anchorage useless, though)



Good luck and happy farming this event, fellow TTKs!<ac_metadata title="Safe Method to Farm Roma at E-6 (not at the boss node)"> </ac_metadata>
