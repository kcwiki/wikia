Now im wondering how far can i get with this fleet? can i clear all the way hard or go medium til the last map and go hard?

i know i really need to work on the heavies and im probably missing alot of good ships.ive never done 3-2 for grinding cuz i cleared it right away and never came back lol ive also never LSC in my life except for that one time my neighbor kept posting a shia la beouf gif holding the lsc button so i got annoyed and did it and got a noshiro lol but yea other than that i just mostly cleared maps and brought along ships i wanted to level i pretty much play everyday so there should be more progress than what i've posted so any advice is helpful<ac_metadata title="I am level 98... and this is my first event"> </ac_metadata>
