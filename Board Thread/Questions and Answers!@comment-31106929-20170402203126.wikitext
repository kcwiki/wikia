Hi, I'm probably missing something in damage calculation, e.g. if we look at situation for World 1-5 ASW

Line Ahead 60%

Line Abreast 130%

Usually with LAb Kanmusu do like 70-130dmg per 1 shot ... but when I accidentally clicked LAh, they all did but a scratch damage, like 1-3 in most cases ... that hardly seems to be the difference as shown above, I would expect them still do like 20-60 dmg (and kill almost always).

Thank you for explanation!<ac_metadata title="Formation modifiers"> </ac_metadata>
