I'm saving alot of ships because they're necessary for some quests but most of them aren't very good and I can't get them through the quests. Should I just keep trying or should I get rid of them and ignore those quests until I can get stronger ships to carry the weak ones through quests? I'm at about 85 ships right now and it's really annoying me.<ac_metadata title="Can I ignore some one time quests?"> </ac_metadata>
