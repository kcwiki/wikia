So, I haven't played KC since mid-spring and missed a lot of updates (and shipgirls... even my baby Michisio got K2 <3 )<br />So I'm asking for a piece of advice. I hadn't modernised equipment much before too, but now I'm completely lost. I searched for priority lists, but all of them are outdated.

What equipment do you recommend to improve (especially planes: fighters and bombers. And what the heck are night bombers??)? I have most of the shipgirls (except for Yamato, Graf and Italian BBs) so it's not a problem.

Thanks a lot in advance.<ac_metadata title="Equipment modernisation priority?"> </ac_metadata>
