Hello all

A while back, I read one of the articles here that was about an American ship that was sunk by a Japanese one because the American ship didn't "zig-zag" and then after the war the commander of the said Japanese ship had to attend court to testify for the American commander's "crime" of neglecting orders...Â 

I remember reading about it but now I cannot find it. I was thinking about reading up on it again, and if anyone can help direct me to the page (or the wikipedia page), that would be wonderful. I just hope that I am remembering correctly and not making things up as it's been awhile (I swear I thought it was Dechi but I seem to be wrong...)

Hope everyone's preparation goes well for the next event.

Thank you. <ac_metadata title="Can&#039;t find a page..." lastmove="1517637504"> </ac_metadata>
