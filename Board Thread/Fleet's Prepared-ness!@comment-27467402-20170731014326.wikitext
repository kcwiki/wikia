As title says, I'm planning on going full hard on this event. I've attempted it in the past, but never managed to breakthrough. I've gotten close during the Spring Event, but I ran out of resources (always have been pretty bad at efficiency). I've learned since, and I currently have the most resources I've ever had before (yay me). I'm feeling confident, but I'd like outsider input.

Right now, I'm looking for advice on these subjects:

-Ships to level/develop

-Equipment to improve/develop (screws are on a short supply)

-What should I be doing from now until the event starts



Yeah, I'm missing some key ships (Taihou, Yamato, Musashi, Ooyodo). I've cut back on LSC in order to build up resources, but should I be trying for any of these ships/grind 1-6? 



Thanks for your help!<ac_metadata title="Looking for my first All-Hard Medal"> </ac_metadata>
