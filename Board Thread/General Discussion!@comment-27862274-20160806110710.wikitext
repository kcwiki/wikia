Been wanting to ask this question for a while. Does higher morale mean higher evasion? E.g. morale of 80 has higher evasion and accuracy than a morale of 60? I know that having sparkled ships leads to higher evasion/accuracy, but i was just wondering if sparkling ships twice makes any difference to those stats.Â <ac_metadata title="Morale and evasion/accuracy"> </ac_metadata>
