I'm looking to complete the whole event on medium but will try to complete E6 or whatever the last map is on hardfor the first class medal therefore I am looking on saving a number of ships specifically for that map.

I am currently levelling Ooi, Kitakami, Ashigara, Nachi, Kongou and Hiei to at least level 70, as well as having my level 77 Hiryuu and level 78 Souryuu.

I am aware that the contents of the final map have yet to be known but should I need any more ships.<ac_metadata title="E6/Last Map on Hard"> </ac_metadata>
