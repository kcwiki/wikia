Hey there. I´m a new TTK and I want to participate in the Spring Event. But I have many questions and I don´t know how I can improve my fleet. I´m currently HQ-Lvl.55. My Resources are:

Fuel:19k / Ammo:25k / Steel:18k / Bauxite:12k /Buckets:104

I haven´t unlocked the fourth fleet yet so I have problems with my resources especially fuel. What is the most important thing for me?

1.Leveling my Shipgirls

2.Collecting Buckets

3.Stockpiling Resources

4.Gather equipment

I know I lack CAVs, CVs and BBs so I plan to bring Ise and Haruna to 50 in 3-2 and Kongou to Kai Ni. I prefer CVLs but I guess leveling Akagi to 50 is necessary. I have no idea what I can do about my lack of CAVs. The only options would be to level Mogami and hope for a Suzuya or a Kumano drop. I can also level my Chikuma to Kai Ni but I only have two medals atm. I plan to bring Ayanami and Hibiki to Lvl.70 but I´m not sure about the others.

Now my questions: Should I level my DDs in 1-5 and hope for an Akashi drop? Or should I focus on my BBs, CAs and CVs? Should I try to collect 4 medals for a BP? Should I level my Shioi for the Prototype Seiran? Which Equipment is necessary? Should I level my BBs/CAs/CVs in 3-2 or just in PvP? Should I try to construct more BBs and CVs or level those I already have?

I think that´s all. I hope you can help me :)[[File:Showcase;Schülerin.png|thumb]][[File:Equipment;Schülerin.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Spring Event 2016 - Preparations for easy"> </ac_metadata>
