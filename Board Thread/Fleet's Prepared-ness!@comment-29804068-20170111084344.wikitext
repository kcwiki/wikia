Hello, I was wondering if anyone could help me. I am aiming for trying to do a mix between easy and medium difficulty since it will be a "small" event. My resources go from 23k fuel and ammo, 33k steel, 19k bauxite and 156 buckets. Farming for resources won't be a problem since i have another month of vacation and will be most likely training and getting more resources.

Also since I don't have any more space (( 98 ships atm llloTL )) i'm trying to clean up the naval base a little bit, what ships won't i be needing and most likely use them as modernization material??

Thanks for the help in advance!
