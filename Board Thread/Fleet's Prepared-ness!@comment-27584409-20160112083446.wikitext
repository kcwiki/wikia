Hey ya folks, I've already greeted some of the folks in the chat and to those that I haven't met, hiya, how's it goin'?

Right, time to get down to it, this is not exactly a fleet prepared-ness thing, or maybe it is, but the fact is, I kinda need some advice in terms of the ships I'll have on hand. Generally, I've drawn up a list of ships I'd basically like to be permanently on call in my base using the following to prioritize them: How much I like their concepts, Unique Capabilities, Ship Class, Stats. Is there anything else I should look out for? Like for instance, the ships that drop during Events, are they a must have or can I afford to skip them once or twice?

Secondly, this might be my first Event, depending on how my leveling goes, is there a general fleet build I should focus on now so that I can level up more efficiently?<ac_metadata title="Some advice needed"> </ac_metadata>
