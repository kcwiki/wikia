hey there 

i'm here again to ask you people for some advice. Last event you guys were a great help for me, i was a low HQ lvl with low lvl ships and thanks to your great advice i did 5 maps in summer ( i was aiming for 3 ) so thank you very much. now i would like you to take a look at my fleet again.

maybe i just got lucky in last event and now i'm having a false sense of safety for the upcoming event so just to make sure i'm not having a false sense of safety.

i will be doing easy and i think i should be able to clear every map on easy. but since last event went so good and i have grown a bit i keep feeling like i could do a few medium maps. not full medium my fleet is definitely not ready for it , but maybe 1 or 2 maps on medium ( depends on difficulty of the map) but from what i heard is that a fall event is way more easy than summer event.

so what do you think of my fleet , easy worthy with possibly e few medium maps , or just easy all the way?

and while we are at it , maybe some advice on which ships to focus leveling 

here is my fleet
