So がか gave me a list of the translations of titles of the various Expeditions for this game.

Given that the Quest page only lists the Japanese titles and not the English titles, I think it should be prudent that we add in the translations for them; afterall, the Quest pages already do so with their titles, so why not the Expeditions?<ac_metadata title="Expedition Title Translations"> </ac_metadata>
