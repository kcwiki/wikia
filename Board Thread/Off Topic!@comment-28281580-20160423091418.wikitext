A: What will Kancolle players speak ?




B: Those sh*t must die all with that sh*tty game.




"B" Pen name is Torahime max. He's a illustrator from Thailand. He describe Kancolle as "Junk Game". I don't know why he spoke likes that but it's very annoying me. What do you think about this ?<ac_metadata title="Message from Zero Wong"> </ac_metadata>
