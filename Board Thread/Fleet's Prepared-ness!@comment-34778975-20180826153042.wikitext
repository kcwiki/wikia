I've been playing since a month before the Kashima reward of Fall 2015 event.  I have diligently completed daily quests and monthly EOs for medals, with a lot of 3-2A spam for daily sorties and general purpose levelling.  What do I need to do with my girls next?
















I've also uploaded a snapshot of my current equipment.  I think I have gotten to the point that I need to begin playing equipment-colle, but need some direction on where to go.  At a stock of 115, I am rather poor on screw supplies and will not spend money to buy them.  (Money is for more ship slots, rings and RE fairies)  So, what should I upgrade to get the best mileage out of the screws I have and what should my fleet be doing now in Phase 2 to earn more than the handful I've been getting for doing weekly quests?[[File:Equipment_List_2018-08-26.jpg|thumb|Dat equipment, yo]]<ac_metadata title="08/26/2018 Fleet Audit:  What ships to work on and what equipment to improve?"> </ac_metadata>
