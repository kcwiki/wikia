There are these slider things i the repair ship area and the build ship area that i have no idea what they do. Since I can't read japanese, and I can't find what it does, could someone either translate what it says on the sliders or tell me what they do? Thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="Repair/Build ship slider"> </ac_metadata>
