All Kancolle admirals at the start of their career have chosen one ship girl out of the five starters, Fubuki, Murakumo, Sazanami, Inazuma and Samidare. The question is, who did you choose and what level is she now? You may share your HQ level for comparison and the reason for your choice of ship girls. Another way of phrasing the main question would be: "Are you still using your starter ship girl in your sortie and expedition fleets?"[[File:Ebc0c29df4067991265992485b6cb0f5.png|thumb]]







Personally, I chose Inazuma as my starter ship girl. The reason was the following video:

As a daily danbooru user and occasional uploader, I got to know Kantai Collection from very early on. I was immediately interested in it and after finding out it was a video game, I obviously wanted to play it. However, after realizing the difficulties of playing it in the western part of the world, I soon gave up on the thought. Fast forward to Spring 2014, I was watching some Kancolle videos at Youtube when I had some free time at my workplace of that time. When I encountered this video and watched it, I became to love Kancolle and I knew I had to play the game. Despite being someone who has trouble showing emotions on a real-life sad situtation, I'm very quick to shed a tear or two for cute anime girls, and that is e[[File:F1d6fb5b9f7f2f0c14166e77832c3ce3.jpg|thumb]]xactly what I did in this video's case. This is why my love for the Akatsuki-class ship girls was born alongside with my love for Kancolle, and one of my main goals when starting the game was to find all the Akatsuki-class ship girls, especially Ikazuchi, who has been my favourite ship girl ever since watching the video in question. Thus, my choice for the first ship girl was obvious.





However, when I got to know the other ship girls, my interest in some characters began to fade somewhat. Inazuma was one of these characters, and eventually she was replaced by other ship girls for the sortie fleet, and she became an occasional expedition fleet member. Now she is level 39, while my HQ is level 98. She was around level ~25 by the time I stopped using her in sorties. I still like her obviously, but the thing is, I like many other ship girls more. Sharing my love for all the ship girls is not something what I can do. Ikazuchi and Hibiki still remain in my sortie fleet, and Ikazuchi is actually my highest level DD (88) and my future waifu. Akatsuki is a common expedition fleet member. A strange thing is, even though Murakumo was not my starter ship girl, she became a permanent member of my sortie fleet, and now she is level 77.



Tl;dr: Inazuma is my starter ship girl, but she became an occasional expedition fleet member and remains at level 39, while my HQ is 98.

I'm looking forward to hearing about how it was with my fellow admirals.<ac_metadata title="What level is your starter ship girl?"> </ac_metadata>
