Hello fellow TTKs. With 2 weeks left until the event, it would be great to have some advice on my fleet (as does evenyone posting here). Since this is only my second event (just started playing 3 months back, a week before the summer event began), I am hoping to finish full Easy at least, with some maps done in Medium if the rewards are worth it.

I am not planning to use ships below Lv 50 in the event, so you may ignore ships below this level.Â Currently I am clearing this month's EOs and doing those long expeditions for a medal and catapult. I should be able to KaiNi my Shoukaku by next week.
