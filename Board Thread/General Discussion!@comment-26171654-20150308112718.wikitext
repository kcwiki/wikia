I have recently heard about a tool called KanColle Tool and tried to see if it works but after seeing it's recent update it's dated Aug 2014.

I heard that major updates on the games will be a problem on tools like this and is most likely to ban the player so are there any players here that has experience using this tool and got banned or still works up until now??

Or are there better tools that translates the game (Preferably the quests, items, weapons, and ship names)<ac_metadata title="KanColle Tool is it safe to use? or are there better tools than this?"> </ac_metadata>
