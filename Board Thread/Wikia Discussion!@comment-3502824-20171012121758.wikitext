Attention to all Wikia Editors:

The Scribunto extension in Wikia has broken down as of 4:55AM PST / 7:55 AM EST, resulting in all Lua Modules invocations across the FANDOM, such as EquipmentLink and ShipBattleCardKai to become non-operational.

If you try to use a Lua Module for an Edit, it will show parts of the template without the parsed Lua modules invocations, resulting in the result similar to this:

{{EquipmentLink}}

Please do not make any edits or publications that involves Lua Modules temporarily even if they're necessary and delay such edit until this technical issue is resolved.

Any previous publications/edits made before the time the extension has broken down will be displayed normally, so please do not touch any pages with Lua modules even if needed until the issue is resolved.

Thank you.
