First of all, sorry for my bad English. It's not my first language.

I finally got my KanColle account, and I don't want to make something stupid and get banned for it. So, what are the safest methods to connect in? (Ok, "safest" in a sense, because I understand that there is no totally safe method).

When I entered the lottery, I followed the next steps: '''1)''' Set my timezone to JSC. '''2)''' Open VPN Gate, and select a japanese server. '''3)''' Open Chrome, with its browser cache in 1024 MB. '''4)''' Clear the browser cache. '''5)''' Navigate to the game website.

But, investigating about application to be able to read the text, I found this: ''"The safe route, which I thought was what everyone was doing, is to activate VPN, get an API link (or OSAPI, it doesn't matter), deactivate VPN and connect using that link. This is safe because Kadokawa don't do region checks, and have no interest in doing so."''

So, is it really necessary to do all of this? Or is it enough only with VPN? <ac_metadata title="Safer methods to connect" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
