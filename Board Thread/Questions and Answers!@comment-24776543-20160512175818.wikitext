Well, due to travel for my job I need to go and play KC it is not possible for a long time for me. In consequence of that I had a reasonable question - how much time should pass before my account will be blocked / deleted for inactivity? I would not want to lose my account because a lot of effort and money invested in it. :/

Sorry for my bad english. ((<ac_metadata title="How much time should pass before my account be blocked / deleted?"> </ac_metadata>
