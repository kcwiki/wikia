I wanted to do F58 quest (finally).

I got my two 99 dive-bombers (unlocked), 2 zuiun (unlocked), 1 max * Zuiun 634 air group (locked) one skilled crew member and scapped to drums.

I got this error message because I forgot to unluck the important stuff the whole quest is about.

When writing this question, I got the solution myself. The possible translation is 'Unlock your 634-airgroup, stupid' (add some japanese politeness). Maybe someone is searching the forums and finds this helpfull.<ac_metadata title="Quest F58 - japanese error message (solved)"> </ac_metadata>
