I've been afk from the game since Gangut's event, which if I don't remember wrong was last year...

But with the release of Phase 2 I feel like playing again so here is my fleet and stuff. I'd like to know what ships you recommend to level up and any other advice you can give me :3[[File:738937fc-c1bc-4f88-ad6a-bff9855f3438.jpg|thumb]]
