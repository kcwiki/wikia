(okay earlier i made a mistake but i've never made pages before so... oops. here we go!)

I am base level 51.Â [[File:14.5.18.jpg|thumb|400px]]I'm trying to level up my DDs, CVs, and CAs. I'm trying to K2 Fubuki, and get Yuudachi back(she sunk). Any other ships other than Sendai, Choukai, and Maya I should level up?[[File:14.5.18.equipment.jpg|thumb|400px]]




I also have bad luck crafting LBAS planes. Should I craft more shells and RADARs?<ac_metadata title="Yeet, a &#039;nother event."> </ac_metadata>
