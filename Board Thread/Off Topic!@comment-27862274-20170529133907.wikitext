So recently i was thinking about playing another game other than Kancolle, since i'm interested in their respective art and character designs. I roughly know the names of the major characters, since i've seen tonnes of pixiv pics. I eventually ended up with these 3 options which i think ill enjoy:

- '''Fate/Grand Order '''

- '''Granblue Fantasy '''

- '''Girls Frontline ('''girls with guns basically) - kinda like KC, but guns. Has some major voice actors e.g. Love live Umi's VA and pretty good artists

brief vid for Girls Frontline - https://www.facebook.com/Girlsfrontline.fanpage/videos/407563886256700/

Can someone tell me what the gameplay is roughly like? and what are the pros and cons of each game? (if u have played it). Also how long does it take to adapt and progress in the game? e.g. In Kancolle, the progression is fairly slow since you can't exactly build a strong fleet fast, and it takes a while to establish a good sense of game knowledge<ac_metadata title="Game recommendations please thanks :)"> </ac_metadata>
