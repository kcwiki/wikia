Well i dont exactly know what happened, but today I tried to go on kancolle, kc3 wasnt loading the game for me, and it gave me the error operation timed out. and then I tried to go on the site itself to get a new api, only the dmm bar loads but not the game. i tried deleting cache, cookie, relogging in, and the only way it loaded was via vpn. i personally do not want to use a vpn, so would anyone have any clue on how i can fix this problem?[[File:Blank?.png|left]]<ac_metadata title="Problem: Getting a blank screen on the kancolle page"> </ac_metadata>
