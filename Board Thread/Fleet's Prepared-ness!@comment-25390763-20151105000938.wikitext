I try to update this as frequently as I can. It's as organized as I can possibly make it. I might add equipment at the bottom if I think I need to.

As for my resources, I'm not terribly worried. I started the Summer Event with only 60k fuel and ended it (without touching E7 and basically searching frantically for a Roma at the last minute) with 20k. I did have to do E-5 and E-6 on Easy due to the insane difficulty spike. E-1 and E-2 were done on Hard and E-3 and E-4 were done on Medium. If Fall 2015 is anything like Fall 2014 (my first event, in which I couldn't get Nowaki but DID get Prinz) then these resources shouldn't be a problem.

I kept this updated occasionally, so if you want to see my ship levels before and afterÂ the Summer Event, just look at the revision history and find an applicable date (August 10/September 4 or 25*)

Thanks in advance. I'm open to opinions.
