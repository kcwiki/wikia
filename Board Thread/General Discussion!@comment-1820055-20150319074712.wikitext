This time, I'm running a Logo/Icon design contest, where the winner shall get 1000 webmoney code that can be used to purchase premium items for your shipfu.

The logo/icon is for KC3 and KC3 Kai.
* [[User_blog:Dragonjet/KanColle_Command_Center]]


'''Dimensions & Specs'''
* Logo: 128 x 128 (which can be easily resized to 64x64 or 48x48)
* Icon: 32 x 32 (which can be easily resized to 16x16)
* Not necessarily 2 versions, if your logo can be resized to 16x16 without affecting quality, you can submit it as '''both logo and icon'''. But as my experience it's difficult to compress a logo into 16x16. I trust some may be able to do it though.
* There should be a layer of '''改''' which we can show/hide for the normal KC3 edition, or edit later on as '''改二''' in case we release another KC3 edition in the future.

'''Prize'''
* Webmoney Code worth 1000 points

Winner will also be included in About pages of the extension and Credits section in the official Extension page here on the wiki.

'''Judging'''
* '''Deadline is March 31, 2015!'''
* I will pick the final winner.
* Can be affected by people's replies and feedback, but in the end I will do the final decision which will be used.
