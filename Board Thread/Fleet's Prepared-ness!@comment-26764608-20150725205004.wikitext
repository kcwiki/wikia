Since it's my first event I'm not aim for higher difficulty. I'm not confident if I can try even medium because of lack of the ships. So which ships i should prioritize to level right now? And how much more Reppuu/ShidenK2 would be enough for the event?

Edit: Excuse me, totally forgot about BB's. Here are my BB's and SS.
