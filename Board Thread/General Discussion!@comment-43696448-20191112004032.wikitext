Hey,

Anyone know if the Devs take suggestions?  (Ya, I know, wishful thinking)

I'd like to see smoke generators added to the game.  Historically, they appear to be a pretty key piece of equipment for DD/DEs - see Taffy 3 during the battle off Samar.  First thing they did was dump smoke.

Maybe something that activates based on luck like the Star Shell.  Or a consumable you activate pre-node like a Combat Ration.  It would buff the evasion for effected ships.  Friendlies with radar would work normally, those without would suffer an accuracy debuff.  Enemies with radar would ignore the friendly evasion buff. 

They could even make it work differently for the various nations.  US smoke covers the whole fleet with average buff.  RN covers the activating ship and the two on either side with a higher buff.  IJN covers whole fleet with lower buff but it carries into Yasen, etc...
