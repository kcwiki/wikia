I am currently using Kirishima K2 and leveling Haruna to K2.

As a 100-slot ttk, I want to save as many slots as possible for other rare ships that I like. So...do I really have to <span style="font-weight:normal;">keep all four of the Kongou sisters or are those two enough?</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">edit: also is it okay for me to scrap Ise, Hyuuga and Mikuma? I never really used the Ise class and I just got Mikuma from 4-3 but she doesn't seem particularly useful...</span><ac_metadata title="Should I keep all four Kongou sisters?"> </ac_metadata>
