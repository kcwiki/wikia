''I'm going to write this thread in english for everyone to understand even though its potential targets are french people (assuming every French people here should be able to understand that much)''

A friend of mine and myselft created a Kancolle Steam group in order to gather some French players and build a little community if possible. We started not long ago and are only a few, we would like to expand as much as possible. Therefore, if you're interested in joining the [http://steamcommunity.com/groups/kancolle-fr# group] , you're welcome. No matter your nationality, as long as you can speak french, we're hoping for your contribution! (or not, actually we would be satisfied enought if you just joined.)

'''Note: We're the first French based community to be created, and considering how fast the Kancolle community is developing, many others will be created in a little time, let's be the first to get a real impact!)'''

We're mainly posting threads, giving infos, creating events, etc... about Kancolle, but we'd undoubtedly talk about many others interesting (hopefully) things if the group gathered more people, so we're looking forward to it. We're also planning to create a forum in the best case.

Don't hesitate to ask more question ;)
