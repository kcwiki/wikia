I realised, as I scrolled down the page, in particular ship's personal pages. if I accidentally go pass the advertisment, it will pop up and the page will continuosly scroll down without me doing so and I can't stop it unless I refresh the page. Anybody have this problem?<ac_metadata title="Scrolling down problems?"> </ac_metadata>
