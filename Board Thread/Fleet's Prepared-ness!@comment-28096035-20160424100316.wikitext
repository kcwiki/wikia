Soo, I haven't been playing for too long (if that wasn't evident enough by my ships) and to be honest my only goal was to get Verniy at first... which I did and then my goal changed to getting Amatsukaze which I've put on hold cause f*** 3-5, anywhoo, I know I'm not even close to being ready for the Easy event, but it's probably time I actually get ready for these things xD So, just wondering what should my priorities be to do before the event after this? (Not really much I can do a week before this event, so might as well get advice for the one after : P)

(You can probably see from my ships and equipment that I'm not even close to being prepared xD Priorities ftw!)
