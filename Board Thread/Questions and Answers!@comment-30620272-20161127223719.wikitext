Please help im new to this game and im having a problem where my ships cause only 1 or 2 points of damage to an enemy? I noticed it was happening a lot on world 1-5. Usually my ships attack normally but then sometimes this weird thing will happen again (usually on nodes d or c). Does it have something to do with submarines maybe?<ac_metadata title="Ships attacking very little?"> </ac_metadata>
