I decided to level up Fusou, since I'm sitting on blueprints (Bisko doesn't arrive...) but since the remodel level is quite high (80) and I'm sick of 3-2A after some marathons for levelling, I was wondering.

There's a better levelling spot? (5-4 is for FBB only) any suggestion?

If so, what compo should I bring?<ac_metadata title="Levelling BBV"> </ac_metadata>
