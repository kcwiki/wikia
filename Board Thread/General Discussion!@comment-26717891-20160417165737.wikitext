Sorry to disturb, but with event approaching I need to keep an eye on my resources.

Kawakaze was sitting at 30ish level and I thought it might be nice to level her a bit, since her art was cute enough.

Also, Kai ni came up so i didn't thought out twice...

Problem is, anyone has a table on the average expense to calculate how much resource 4-3 intense grinding is gonna be?

Any insight will be worth it, thanks a lot for the patience (^__^)7<ac_metadata title="Leveling cost and expenses"> </ac_metadata>
