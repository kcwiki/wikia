Since I've just come back to the game from over a year of hiatus, my fleet faced a year of set back. The fleet was in quite a good condition when I left so most of the girls that I have at the time are quite high leveled. But apparently, the era of Kaini'ing a ship easily and sensibly is over so there's some decision to be made.

Currently, I have 24 medals in possession (which makes 6 bp) and I'd like some advice on who I should remodel with the long term benefit of the fleet in mind. Here goes the lists the ships that need BP from the medal page

Nagato, Tama, Kinu, Zara = ready for remodelling (on hold)

Arashio, Suzuya (plan for CVL), Kumano (plan for CVL), Katsuragi, Naganami (AR available), Kasugamaru = Need some more leveling

Saratoga = Not available

ABKM, Shoukaku, Zuikaku, Fusou, Yamashiro, Tone, Chikuma, Suzuya CAV, Kumasi CAV, Ooshio, Choukai, Yura, Italia, Roma, Bismarck, Unryuu, Amagi, Ryuuhou  = Already K2

These are the tentative info of the girls. As you can see there're lots to choose from . I can level one or two girls up in no time, but BP wise, it's as stated above. 

Thanks in advance. :D<ac_metadata title="BP decision plan (Advice appreciated)"> </ac_metadata>
