Hi guys, the event is slowly drawing near and I'm leveling quite a bit at the moment but I'd like to know which ships to train first according to you (and to which level too of course).

I'm HQ lvl 91

DDs : Yuudachi (74), Shigure (72), Hibiki (71, not remodeled yet for quest reasons), Ushio (62), Shimakaze (61), Inazuma (58). Not so good... I should probably train Amatsukaze and Yukikaze up to par too.

CL : Sendai (78), Yahagi (55), Kiso (50), currently training Jintsuu (28). It's ok I guess.

CLT : KTKM (78), Ooi (76). Not quite a concern now.

CA : Takao (55), Maya (47), Kako (46), Atago (45), Choukai (42). Don't laugh too much... Getting Kako and Maya to K2 is my priority.

CAV : Tone (70, K2) Kumano (50), Suzuya (36), Mogami (35). Not so bad I guess. 

CVL : Ryuujou (75), Hiyou (63). That's it...

CV : Souryuu (70), Akagi (63), Shoukaku (62), Katsuragi (36). Missing Kaga and Hiryuu... That sucks. Levels aren't too high either...

BBV : Yamashiro (80). Not K2 for now.

FBB : Kongou (81), Haruna (66), Kirishima (42), HIei (41). I should probably get them all to K2 quickly ><

BB : Nagato (67), Mutsu (53). Don't quite know about these...

I got a blueprint to spare and can probably get another one before the end of the month. Any suggestions about their use?

What should I absolutely do? What should I do then? Tell me. The sooner it's done the sooner I can stockpile.

Thanks for reading.<ac_metadata title="Priorities, aiming for Hard"> </ac_metadata>
