Hi TTK's.



First of all, i thought i'd find somewhere on the wiki a page about nodes farming for ressources. There isn't, or i really badly checked. That's why i'm posting here :^)

I wanted to ask, fellow TTK's, if you know a place where i could find a guide for farming? Just like the expedition one we got on the wiki.  If not, the n00b i am would enjoy some advices :v 

Expeditions and auto-resup' ain't enough, of course, i wanted to start grinding, but i don't really know where to start. 

Take good care of me! :v <ac_metadata title="Resssources nodes farming"> </ac_metadata>
