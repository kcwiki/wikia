I always used Rakuten (the only way to pay via a non-Japanese credit card), but now the Rakuten pay has changed, and credit cards inside and outside Japan are categorized differently.
Now here's the problem: when I tried to by DMM points, it FORCES ME to give information about a credit card effective in Japan, which I do not own one. Presumably, it will also force me to pay via that Japanese credit card, which means even if I entered info about my credit card again, it would still not work.

Is there any other way to buy DMM points now (such as perhaps via android version?)? or are we simply doomed?<ac_metadata title="How to buy DMM points from outside Japan now?"> </ac_metadata>
