Hi all, I'm new here... I need some advice from my Sempai. Last event I tried it just for the lols and got to E2 (on easy of course), this event I'd like to see the end of it, so I need some hints on what to do next. Here are my ships, equipment and resources:

Fuel 63k, ammo 50k, steel 47k and baux 44k. 404 buckets and 290 dev mat.

I'll be grateful for any help, tnx![[File:EquipYK.jpg|thumb|Stuff that goes pew]][[File:FleetYK.jpg|thumb|Kanmusu]]<ac_metadata title="Am I ready for Easy run?"> </ac_metadata>
