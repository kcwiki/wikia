This thread have been opened since the last three events in order to obtain information pertaining the event bosses, due to the fact that their information are no longer accessible from the master data from Summer 2015 Event onwards. This thread still fulfills the purpose for any potential new battle mechanics and enemies introduced in the upcoming event, particularly for the land-based aircraft battle mechanic, as well as the links for the event maps.

In a nutshell, you should report any instances of new enemies and new API calls here.

Some links to get you started on how to obtain API information in order to help wiki out:
