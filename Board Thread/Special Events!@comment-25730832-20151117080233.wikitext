'''This is only for the [[Fall 2015 Event]]! Anything else is irrelevant in here.'''

Got a sortie that resulted in some "what just happened?" moments? Stuffs like 1-hit kill on boss at day time? Support fleets that sinks everything? A single non-taiha ship that managed to sink the boss + 4 escorts at night battle? Jesus ship came back from the dead and sink the boss?

Post the moment that you found to be worthy of people going "wtf?" or "damm, that's a lucky run" in here. Pictures attached are preferred because you don't want people to call your 'luck' bullshit right?

This is just for fun, as I saw quite a number of RNG blessing runs during the summer (*cough* Jesus Myoukou *cough*).Â
