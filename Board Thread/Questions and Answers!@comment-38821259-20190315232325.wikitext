<br />No, I'm being deadly serious.

I've spent something like two years on this game, and now I fail to find anything left to do in it. The options, off[[File:30b8efb0-e800-4498-80c7-73263288d850.png|thumb]][[File:575fdf84-6b40-4481-b7c4-327892c4acfe.png|thumb]] the top of my head.

1. Clear Events! Yeah, these can be fun, have fancy loot, and sometimes even drop good ships. Unfortunately, they last for a week once per season. So much fun you could almost... you know, accidentally forget about them.<br />2. Upgrade _gearname_! Ah yes, the biggest timesink of the game, farming screws. Where fully upgrading an Iowa cannon takes roughly six months, and that's just screws. Honestly, I no longer see the point in all those +3's that take weeks of dedication in a game where combat is dictated mostly by blind chance. No, I do have a Hard Medal and no desire to get another one.<br />3. Get _shipname_! I've been crafting bloody Saratoga for literal years now. Fuck that, no night planes for me. I should probably replace the Mutsukis with their more up to date sisters, but that AACI just sounds... unrewarding. Some other DDs can be replaces by more high-end ones, but I'm doing fine anyway so why bother. I also have a fundamental distrust for anything thinner than a CA. I can go into details on why every ship is there if anybody wants it.<br />4. Farm for equips? I am against named plane dupes, personal thing. Maybe get a Tama for the bulge for Kiso, which again just sounds like a huge waste of effort. Like farming in general these days.<br />5. Complete Quest Somethingorother. Crucial ones were done a year ago. The rest is pointless busywork, practically impossible with 100 slots. And yes, I'm not buying slots. Or anything else for that matter. Again, personal preference. (If a preachy smartass pops up and tries to explain just how wrong I play a silly browser game about anime girls that are also warships, prepare to be told off. That is ''not'' the point today.)<br />6. ...<br />7. Okay I'm done. Any suggestions? You could probably spare me the silly challenges some do, like "clear all hard with a potato fleet", or "do the above while blindfolded and taped to a chair", and the like. Although, who knows, at this rate I might get bored enough...<ac_metadata title="Is there anything else left to do in lategame?"> </ac_metadata>
