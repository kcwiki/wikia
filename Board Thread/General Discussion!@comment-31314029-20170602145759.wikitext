Ok guys.

This is a post in which you sort your ships by ID order and then talk about your experience in clearing the maps of KC with them, and some milestones. Since KC is pretty random in terms of ships gotten, each TTK SHOULD have totally different experience with the gameplay and clearing of maps depending on the ships he/she had on hand at that moment. I`ll go with 2 lists, DDs and everything else. Since I`m a 100-slotter, it will be kinda short.

OVERVIEW:

Ok, first thing first. I`m a returnee. Meaning i opened my account WAAAAY back (like, i think a bit more than 2 years back) and played for 3 months, in a pretty amateur way (seldom used wiki, I fielded the fleet in whichever way i wanted, and fielded tons of CL and DD and BBs together, barely did quests etc.) then RL took hold of me (job) and i stoped playing for more than a year (Hq level 55 at that moment),  THEN i returned,last November if I remember well. (DMM didn`t erase my account as i feared, luckyly).

I was, and still consider myself, pretty casual to the game. 

My first event was Winter 17, which I didn`t finish (I think i missed fall 16 and Saratoga because of noobness T.T). I was around ID 990 when I entered the world of events, as the higher rarity of ships can attest. OK, that`s the general overview of my base, now to the girls.

DDs:

Well, as I said, 100-slotter here. So I`ve scrapped more DDs than I wanted to admit (even some kinda cherished ones) however, they are all remembered: ID-3 Shirayuki, ID-4 Mutsuki Kai, ID-10 Kagerou Kai, Shiratsuyu Kai, Shimakaze Kai V 2.0 and others that I did raise for a certain extend.







Anyway, talking about the ones that have managed to stay so far: Samidare, being number 1 (to Shiratsuyu`s changrin) was Flagship of the fleet and higher leveled girl, like until level 15, when she was surpassed by Yuubari which was herself surpassed by Hiei when i was clearing 2-3 and 2-4. 

My early favs for DDs were, aside of Sami, hatsuharu, nenohi and murasame. So, it`s no wonder they were the ones in charge of clearing 3-2 when I reached it. The ACTUAL task-force was as follows:

With Hibiki, Shiranui and Ayanami as reserves (that`s why all of them are still on base and they WILL ALWAYS stay if I had some say on the matter). On those days hibiki began her flair for being one-shot taihaed, and I used my first damecon to clear, being Poi the one that sank and the came back. (so far 3 damecons used)The first K2 was Poi (ofc).Which was K2ed for winter 16. 

Yukikaze barely made it to event (W17), but she became staple in it, with Shimakaze. I got my teruzuki there, and i LOVE her. As you can see, I finished 1 event and played (combining both periods) for nearly a year before I finished the Z1 quest line O.o. (still looking for bismark, drop plz).




EVERYTHING ELSE:

Ok, let`s see: I got all sendai sisters pretty quickly, if I remember (scrapped 2, but got sendai back later) before I got kuma, i believe. The Myoko sisters actually took WAY too long to appear.The Myoko listed was the actual first Myoko.





As you can seeI actually got all kongos before I got all Myokos (yeah, I scrapped both Nachi and Ashigara. Don`t worry, I`ll get Nachi back). As a side note, I got Fusou pretty late, at 800 (around the same time as  Mutsu). So I`m pretty biased towards FBBs and barely gave normal BBs a chance.

[[File:Yuub.png|left]] was the first non-DD ship I got, and she is the most cherished (she has cleared all maps except 1-1 and 2-4) and she is the candidate for ring.

were the staples for most of world 2 and world 3 clearing, soon joined by

(loved her lines).

in hindsight, came very, very late and I had to resort to abuse both  of this

for world 2. Sadly 2-4 made me hate them, both because of off-routing and of  taiha So, 2-4 was the reason I stopped being noob/amateur and visited Wiki in all seriouness. At that time, I learned the ropes (including CV recipes ). and leveled them up by butting heads with 2-4

[[File:Akagiz.png|left]]

went all the way from level 1 to level 35 before I cleared that god-forsaken map.



An usual 2-4 was like this

Ofc, I had to drop Yuubari later for Hiei and cleared 2-4.Yuubari was my first Kai girl, followed closely by Kuma and Hiei For world 3 I dropped Hiryu and Soryu for Atago and Maya. And Hiei for (you guessed it) Yuubari in order to "save res". 

Then came 3-2, oh boy. 3-2 is discussed in DD, but the girls clearing it grew from lvl 20-ish to mid-30ish while clearing. Same with the CL flagships Yuubari / Kuma

After that, and fully realizing the shenanigans of the game, I began clearing more easily. I was, If i remember well, into 4-1 or 4-2 when winter 17 came.

At the time I had only Yuubari, Kuma, Atago, Takao, Akagi , Shimakaze and all Kongos in a somewhat decent level (40-50), so they tackled the event alone (easy ofc). After the event, I cleared all maps of world 4 within 2 days. Kinda anticlimatic actually. Again Yuubari, Shimakaze and Yukikaze (with Akagi and Mogami/ Suzuya) did the heavy lifting.

As for SS, well you can see.... got Imuya somewhat early and then took 800 ships for her to have some company when Iku joined. I was so desperate I actually tried orel cruising with Imuya by herself lol. But then I got Iku and Yuu and they helped stockpile res for spring, In which hachi joined (still no orel from hachi, but she will join next month).

All the while. Tenryu has almost always being flag of fleet 2 and tatsuta almost always being flag of fleet 3, doing expeditions for the cause.

There you go, In my experience, my CV and SS came very late, so I had to use mainly CVL and CLs to clear, along with the Kongo sisters (the only BBs I gave serious consideration until Nagato came along)

As for power leveling, and events. That`s for other stories. So far the staples of the wiki have being my staples on the events, too. ABKM, CLTs, Isuzu, Shigure etc. Much powerleveling for them on 3-2 and 4-3. Nagato was awesome on spring, made me realize what I was missing by siting her and mutsu to "save res"(sorry Kongo, but It`s true).

Got Roma on LD clearing Spring 17 (so Roma and Gangut at the same run, best 1k resources spend ever.)

The last girl of winter 17 that i kept was Yuu (1314), since Iku was the first (1067) you can see I got 250-ish girls on Winter event.

And the first girl of Spring being DD Kiyoshimo (2667), meaning i grinded 1300 shipgirls worth of powerleveling between Winter and spring.With Harusame (2959) being the last ship kept. Meaning, I ran the event enough to drop 300 girls on Spring.
