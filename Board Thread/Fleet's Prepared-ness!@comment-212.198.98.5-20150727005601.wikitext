Soo, I started playing on July 6th, and I'm currently trying to grind my fleetgirls as efficiently as possible so I have the best possible shot at clearing the upcoming event. Ideally I'd like to try looting the earlier maps in Easy mode for event-only drops, maybe clear a couple maps in Normal mode depending on rewards and feasibility, and clear the full event in the highest possible difficulty for each map (very probably Easy for most maps).

Here's my current upper roster. I grind at 3-2-A in full rotation (to maximize global xp instead of focusing on one fleetgirl at a time).

Battleships: Nagato (33), Kongou sisters (29), Fusou (50), Yamashiro and Hyuuga (23)

Heavy Cruisers: Maya (32), Choukai (20), Kinusaga (20), Atago (12)

Aviation Cruisers: Suzuya (37) and Mogami (30)

Torpedo Cruisers: Kitakami (51), Ooi (50)

Destroyers: Yuudachi (46), Fubuki (42), Hibiki (27), Shigure (27), many more around level 25 (no Shimakaze though)

Aircraft Carrier: Akagi (49) and Kaga (38) - haven't been lucky enough to get the others yet

Light Aircraft Carrier : Jun'you (53), Hiyou (45), Ryuujou (9)

Submarines: Iku (45), Goya, Imuya and Hachi (72)

For now, my roadmap is basically "try to drop Shimakaze and Souryuu, grind them to decent levels, keep on grinding and then grind some more". Any more prirorities I should have?

(I know Reppuu is great, but unfortunately I haven't obtained any yet - I do have a few 3-star red planes though.)<ac_metadata title="Newbie TTK, event clear feasibility?"> </ac_metadata>
