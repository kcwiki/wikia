So, this is going to be my first event ever and im not sure if i should run medium or just easy instead.

Here's my fleet status:

DDs: Verniy (70), Yuudachi k2 (70), Shimakaze k (67), Yukikaze k (42), Shigure k (37) and Hamakaze k (36).

CL(T): Sendai k2 (63), Ooi k2 (60), Kiso k (45), Kitakami k (40) and Tama k (35)

CA: Only Furutaka and Kako (31, 27)

BBs: Hiei k (57), Kongou k (55), Yamashiro k (48), Kirishima k (36) and Haruna k (31).

CV(L): Shouhou k (77), Ryuujou k2 (76), Akagi k (61), Kaga k (41). I also have Souryuu but she's lvl 1 though.

SS: I-19 (66), I-58 (61), I-168 (62) and I-8 (60).

I'm currently leveling all those ships above, but what else should i be focusing here? Do i really need a CA(V)? cause i don't have any :(

About my equips:

1 Reppu and a lot of other fighters, 8 Suisei and 1 Suisei model 12A, 3 Ryuusei, 4 Ryuusei Kai, 1 Tenzan, 1 Saiun, 1 Type 2 Recon Aicraft, 7 Zuiun, 1 Seaplane night scout, 1 22 RADAR and 1 21 RADAR, 2 AP Shells, a lot of SONARS and Depth charges, 1 searchlight and 1 star shell.

What should be my next step? (I have a lot of resources, but I'm only with 80 buckets right now)<ac_metadata title="Should i go for medium or easy?"> </ac_metadata>
