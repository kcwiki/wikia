HOW WAS YOUR EVENT GUYS?

Did you suffer, did you win? Did you believe in the [[Thread:303011|Fubuki Theorem]]?
THE EVENT'S OVER, NONE OF THAT MATTERS NOW.

Its a few more hours before we get some new Yukata CG, but in particular, I just want to see some '''Sendai''' art, so please draw our favorite Night Battle idiot! (Yukata preferable, tho Ninja is 120% welcome)

There's nothing to do after the event! '''GET TO WORK.'''

Even if you have little drawing skill, just draw something!

FALUKORVS ARE STILL NOT ALLOWED.
