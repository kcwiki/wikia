[[File:Snapshot_2015-10-29_6-35-36.jpg|thumb|left|306px|Fleet]]Excuse me, this is my third event after spring and summer. in the last event i really mess up my fleet locking strategy so i didn't clear the event. My HQ lvl is 77 and still not unsure if my fleet can go all medium clear.



This is my fleet, right now im focusing to leveling my CA and CVL[[File:Snapshot_2015-10-29_6-36-26.jpg|thumb|left|306px|Equipment]]



My resource status right now is

24K/22K/27K/24K/187

(i know my bucket aren't enough)

my fleet focus in the CTF.



Thank you<ac_metadata title="Easy-Medium clear ?"> </ac_metadata>
