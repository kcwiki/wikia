I have my DMM account, and the KanColle Tool and Viewer.Â 

Whenever I open the Tool, all I get is a blank screen :c Whenever I use the viewer, I get a window asking me for API... Is there a way around having to give my API? Or to fix the Tool?

Thanks ahead of time ^^<ac_metadata title="Need help with the KanColle Tool :x"> </ac_metadata>
