Wow, Tanaka. Just. Wow. You've somehow managed to create ''the'' most average cruiser possible. She's just... So... Average. Average hitpoints. Below-average torpedo stats. Average firepower. Average AA. Average planes. The only thing that is even notable is the less resources consumed. She's the only heavy cruiser with Long Range! But.... she doesn't give a secondary shelling phase. She has the capability to be an incredibly, incredibly well-armoured CA. Why? IRL, The Zara-class heavy cruisers had TWO armoured decks and TWO armoured belts. This made the Zara-class THE best-protected heavy cruisers in the world, until the introduction of the American Des Moines. Yet... her armour... is barely above-average. Tanaka, please. If you did a bit more research, you'd find out just how tough these ships were.  <ac_metadata title="Zara - the blandest cruiser in the game." lastmove="1460273383"> </ac_metadata>
