'I need to get good' that was the advice given to me by my (IRL) friend before the summer event and eventually I gave up Teruzuki for the Prototype Flight Deck..... Any questions for help usually ended up "Oh well my ships were 'x' level 'y amount of time' ago lol" and so on. Even now it's the reponse so asking my friend is getting nowhere but he at least started advising me on focusing PFD or Teruzuki at the end at least.

So while I'm at a loss from endlessly grinding blindly I kindly ask if someone could spare time to have a look at my fleet to help me focus my time in the right places to prepare for please.

Hoping that I can complete the event on Medium
