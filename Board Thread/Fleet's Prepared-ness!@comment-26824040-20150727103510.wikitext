Notes: Maya-sama will be Kai Ni'd tommorow, as will Chitose. Naka and Jintsuu are both at 21, so im not going to push them.

I joined in December (like, the 26th or somthing), missed Yuu-chan, got fired up for the spring event and made it through on easy with Furutaka as my only Kai Ni. No hotels or luck with crafting at all, with the glaring exeption of Nagato, but fairly good luck in battle.

Im thinking Hard>Med>Med>Easy>Easy>Easy

What should I focus on next?<ac_metadata title="Time for me to join up and do this too, IS MY FLEET READY FOR THIS POTENTIALLY SALTY EVENT?"> </ac_metadata>
