last event i could only afford to E-2, at that time my most highest leveled kanmusu is fubuki at lv 31 and i don't even have good equipment and i don't even know about max stats from modernization.

this time i'm more prepared and this is the most i can do for them<ac_metadata title="What should i do now? more powerleveling? time to start on orel? and what diff. can i make it during event?"> </ac_metadata>
