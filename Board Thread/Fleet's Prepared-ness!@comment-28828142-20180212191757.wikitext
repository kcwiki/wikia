My resources aren't the best--80k/80k/65k/55k/400 buckets. Also I'm aware my Shima fleet is a disaster and I'm lacking fighters. I don't even dream about doing the last map on normal, but would like to try the rest if possible.

I have two blueprints, waiting to see if Musashi will somehow need two. If she doesn't, would you recommend Chikuma or Unryuu?
