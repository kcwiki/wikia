Greetings fellow Admirals,

This thread will discuss Taihou's designation as a CVB.

Through English translations, Taihou is currently classified as a CVB, or large aircraft carrier. This term is incorrect due to the relative size of carriers during WWII. In particular, much larger carriers such as the Midway of the USN officially used the designation CVB. On the other hand, Taihou is much smaller than the CVB designation would suggest.

I would like to suggest some possible class designations for Taihou the armored aircraft carrier:

'''CVR''': The idea behind this designation is that the R stands for "reinforced". In other words CVR would mean "reinforced aircraft carrier", which would be a fitting designation for the armored carrier Taihou.

'''ACVR''': This suggestion takes into account the designation for the armored cruiser, which is ACR. Normally, a cruiser is designated by the letter C. Following this logic, we could call an armored aircraft carrier ACVR.

I would like to hear other suggestions for classifying the armored carrier, as well as whether you prefer any of these suggestions or would just keep Taihou classified as a CVB.

Have a good day!
