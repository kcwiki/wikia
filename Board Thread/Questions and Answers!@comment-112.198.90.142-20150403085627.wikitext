I've started to play 2 days ago, and i don't get the error on the first day Yesterday and today, I keep getting it Â no matter how much i refresh/clear cache

I opened the developer console and this seems to be the error:

203.104.248.135/kcsapi/api_port/port:1 http://203.104.248.135/kcsapi/api_port/port net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING

My time and date is set to Tokyo Standard Time

Can anyone tell me what's wrong and what i can do to avoid having errors? Thank you in advance<ac_metadata title="I keep getting the car and girl error screen please help"> </ac_metadata>
