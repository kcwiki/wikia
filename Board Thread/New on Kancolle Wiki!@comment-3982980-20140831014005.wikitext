      I just created a new page on a "new" (probably not) [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Proxy_Connection_via_HSS solution] for connecting to websites with regional content like [http://www.dmm.co.jp/ dmm], [https://www.netflix.com Netflix], [https://www.youtube.com Youtube],[http://www.nicovideo.jp Niconico] and the like, and maybe if the guys approve of the method they could add it as another option in [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Proxy_Connection Tutorial: Proxy Connection] . I'm just trying to get it out there for peeps who are trying to expand their horizons and especially for other users who are having trouble with the VPN Gate method (like me). <ac_metadata title="Another VPN method" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
