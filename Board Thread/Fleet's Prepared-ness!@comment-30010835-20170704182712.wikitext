[[File:Equipment_List_2017-07-05.jpg|thumb]][[File:Admiral_ケッヴィン_Ship_List_(1).jpg|thumb]]This is my gonna be my 4th event and my first summer event. After doing such a research on past summer event, I though summer gonna drain my sanity. 

I'm not targeting to the reward, actually. I'm just want to pass this event but I wish I could do better than doing the event in all easy mode. For my reso? its a bit above the softcap untill I write here. 

Maybe I can get some advice for my fleet and the difficult that I must choose...<ac_metadata title="Can I clear my first summer?"> </ac_metadata>
