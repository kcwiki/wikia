From the aforementioned question, I mean, are torpedoes on first slot then cannon on second slot for dd's (just being arbitrary here) and green plane, then blue plane then red plane for aircraft carriers (again just being arbitrary here). By now I'm hoping you have the slightest clue to what I'm talking about. I'm also wondering if cannons are more effective on BB's and torpedoes more effective on DD's.. I'm sorry if this has already been discussed but I'm relatively new to the game and being a noob does bring a lot of questions.<ac_metadata title="What weapons are a generally agreed upon rule to be used on ship types (if any)?"> </ac_metadata>
