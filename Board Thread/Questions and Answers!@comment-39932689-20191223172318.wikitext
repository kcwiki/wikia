Hey I was wondering - is there actually a possibility to for example buy DMM Points using your credit card and then send them as a gift to a different account (you buy them, but you decide what account will get it - for example my friend) - a similar thing like on Steam. Any chances?<ac_metadata title="DMM Payment" related_topics="Shop/Purchasing"> </ac_metadata>
