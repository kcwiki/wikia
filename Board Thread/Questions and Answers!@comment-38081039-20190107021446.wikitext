I don't know what to say guys, I'm around Admiral Level 28 and I did not recieve a Naka out of my Sorties or Constructions. I play every day and manage to do all my daily constructions but I haven't recieved a Naka yet. Because of this issue I cannot complete the ''Arange the Three Sendai-class Light Cruiser Sisters!'' mission and open the third fleet.

If somone can give me a tip or help in anyway so I can get Naka feel free to tell me.<ac_metadata title="How to get Naka ?"> </ac_metadata>
