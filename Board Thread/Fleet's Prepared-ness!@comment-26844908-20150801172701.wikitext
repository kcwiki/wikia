It's my first event, and due to levelling ships, I'm broke as hell, at the time of writing: 3k fuel and ammo, 20k steel, 13k bauxite, with 9 days to go.

So my dilemma is:

A) Should I go into the event with stronger ships but flat ass broke

B) Or go in to the event with weaker ships but with a couple thousand more resources?

Not bothering to post Eq. List because it's all garbage. Planning on Easy since I'm likely not prepared for Medium. My fear is that I don't want to stockpile resources to find that once I'm in the event, my ships aren't even strong enough to clear maps regardless of how much resources I have.<ac_metadata title="I&#039;m broke but should I just YOLO and continue levelling?"> </ac_metadata>
