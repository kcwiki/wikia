Hello fellow TTKs. Winter event is coming, so I guess I can use some advice on my fleet.[[File:Vadefleet1.png|thumb]][[File:Vadefleet3.png|thumb]]

I think I have a pretty balanced fleet at the moment and I am not sure which aspects I should work on right now. Here are some tasks that I am planning to do before stockpiling resources for the event: 

1) Finish 4 monthly EOs for blueprint

2) Level Unryuu to 50 for remodelling

3) Kasumi Kai 2? (Depends on how good she gets. Probably won't do this unless the stats are extremely good or she comes with a FCF)

4) Equipment improvements (I have about 50 screws available, but again not sure which equipments to use them on) 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks! =D<ac_metadata title="Where to go from here?"> </ac_metadata>
