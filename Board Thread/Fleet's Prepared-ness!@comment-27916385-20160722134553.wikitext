The summer event is coming and I already start to panic. I wasn't able to clear the last event and I hope that this one will be a little bit easier.

One of the problems is my anti-sub equip. I already tried to build T3 sonars but I only got T93. I think about leveling Kiyoshimo to 30 for eqip and doing the quest. Or would it be better to continue constructing?                                                                             Is it a good idea to train Isuzu to 50 for ASW?

My resources don't look really good, too. 22.000/22.000/22.000/20.000 and 110 buckets. 

What can I improve?<ac_metadata title="Summer 2016 Preparedness for easy mode"> </ac_metadata>
