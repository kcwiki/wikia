Hi everyone, recently I started playing Kancolle and I do not know what ships it takes to have a good team (Destroyer, Submarine .. I really am a super noob :D). With the team I'm using now I managed to pass 3 places in World-1 but the last of 3 stars is impossible...

Here is an image of my team (http://i.imgur.com/5vABBnj.png) the main team is my flagship Fubuki (one of my favorites :3) I had Yuudachi but unfortunately I lost trying to finish World-1 (On a 3 star map) poi :(

Thank you.<ac_metadata title="How to make a good team? Help me please."> </ac_metadata>
