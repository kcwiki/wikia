Hello again fellow teitoku,<br />
My second proper event is finally incoming and I want other peoples thoughts of my fleet, and what difficulty I should aim for

I know mostly what to do in the time remaining (give 3 CVL, 2-3 CAV & 3 DD under lv70 some better levels/K2),<br /> 
but am wondering what everyone else's thoughts on my fleet are, and what I should prioritise

My rsc is abysmal atm 27/25/29/14 - 295[[File:Bucket.png]] (I did some brutal quests, maps and EOs recently)

As I just K2ed Abukuma, I'm wondering whether to give next months BP to Tone(lv01) or Zuikaku (lv70)
