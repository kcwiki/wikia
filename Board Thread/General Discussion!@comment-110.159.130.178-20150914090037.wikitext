It happened just recently, like a few days ago. 

I'm using my API link with KCV and after about 5 to 6 hours it will automatically bump me to a cat error screen. Refresh with F5 / Clear cache and start game will immediately lead me to cat error.  The API fails even when I'm not playing.

The only choice I have is to log in to DMM and get a new API.  Anyone encounter this issue recently?<ac_metadata title="API link duration?"> </ac_metadata>
