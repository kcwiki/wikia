This is an attempt to gather all reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-6</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Summer 2014 Event]] comments.

It would be helpful, but not forced, to include these information if available:
* HQ Level
* Equipment LoS (special formula) and Total LoS
* Route - the nodes or the direction your fleet went
* Fleet Composition
** Better if including equips so we can check equipment LoS
** Better if including ship levels so we can see base LoS
* Screenshots are fine


'''Non-composition reports, e.g. branching theories or general tips are also good'''

'''Posting of enemy encounters are fine too'''<ac_metadata title="[Summer 2014 Event] Reports: E-6" related_topics="Summer 2014 Event"> </ac_metadata>
