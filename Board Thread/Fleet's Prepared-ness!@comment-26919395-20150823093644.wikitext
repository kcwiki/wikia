I have 8 CL ,Alot DD 33 and 1 BB (Haruna got from event drop) 

I still cannot Clear map 2-1 , how shall i arrange my main fleet? more destroyer or more CL? i cannot get a single CV yet , i have no idea how to get it i use formula from Construction page and it no luck. 

More DD or More CL better? I was farming map 1-5 to lvup my main fleet now . DD alway red zone too easy , not sure why people  say they really good. Shall i keep lvup my main fleet in map 1-5?<ac_metadata title="Newbie here please help"> </ac_metadata>
