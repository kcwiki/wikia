Hey there!

Gonna try to swim across the sea of salt again.

I'm aiming for '''Hard''' as much as my resources can handle, then I'll go '''Medium'''.
(I luckily succeed in the previous event against the CA Summer Princess, two days before the end of the event...)

My HQ is 102.

Here's what I have worth of using (-> mainly all my Lv70+ ships) :
[[File:Shiplist_Epsilon-2C.png|thumb|Shiplist Epsilon-2C]]
- 10 destroyers (Including Yukikaze, Yuudachi)

- 5 CL (Including Kinu K2, ABKM K2)

- 3 CLT

- 5 CA (Including Myoukou, Choukai, Maya)

- 3 CAV (Tone-class + Mogami)

- 7 CV (Including Zuikaku K2)

- 3 CVL (Including Jun'you)

- 4 FBB (Including Bismarck, Iowa)

- 3 BB (Including Musashi & Warspite)
- 2 BBV (Fusou-class)

I also have SS(V)s, Mizuho, Kashima, Akitsu Maru, Taigei & Hayasui. 
(See the attached picture for all the details)

Besides I have some valuable (improved for some) '''equipment''', including :

- 4 Akiguns

- 2 20.3 n°3 & 8 20.3 n°2

- 1 Prototype 35.6cm, 2 Prototype 41cm, 2 Bisguns, 2 Dazzle camo, 3 16inch & 2 38.1 Mk.I

- 5 Shiden K2, 1 Reppu, 1 Re.2005 Kai

- 1 Ekusa Squadron, 2 Murata Squadron & 1 Tomonaga Squadron

- Some Zuiuns including the Prototype Seiran and 2 Zuiun Model 12

- 2 Type 22 Surface Radar K4, 1 Type 33

- 3 Depth Charges, 6 Type 3 SONARs

- 5 Sanshikis

- 2 T1 AP Shells

- 2 WG42

- Some Ko-hyotekis, 2 FCF, yasen stuff, etc.


My current biggest issue is '''my resources''' (~200 buckets, ~40k fuel/ammo, 50k steel & 28k bauxite). I don't plan to farm anything else than resources until the event. My current expeditions are '''2/5/38'''.

So... Am I ready for full Hard or Hard->Medium at least? Should I change my expeditions, build or improve some equipment? For what should I be worried the most?

Thanks, and sorry for the wall of text. Feel free to skip anything useless.

'''PS:''' Unfortunately I'm a student, so I won't have much time to play during the event, let's say around 3h on Tuesdays, 2h on Thursdays and 6-10h on Saturdays/Sundays.<ac_metadata title="Am I even ready for this?"> </ac_metadata>
