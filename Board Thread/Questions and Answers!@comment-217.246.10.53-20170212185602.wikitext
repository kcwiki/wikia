I seem to get a quest error with thequest F28, Iwamoto T21 quest:

Equip a rank 7 Type 0 Fighter Model 21 (Skilled) on Zuikaku as secretary, then scrap 2 Type 0 Fighter Model 21

I put a "max"Â  >> T21 (skilled) on secretary flagship Zuikaku Kai, scrapped two T21s, and the quest is marked as completed, but I can't "finish" it by clicking on it - instead I get the shown error message.

Any hint? What does it say? What can I do?

Tried already from inside and without KC3Kai, but no difference.

I wonder whether it may have to do with the switch to the next week, though there seem to be no weekly quests linked to that particular quest and those required by it...<ac_metadata title="Quest F28 Iwamoto T21 quest error?"> </ac_metadata>
