Recently I've been thinking on this: 

'''The KanColle developers''' are planning to make a '''new modernization for the Shoukaku Sisters'''...So I asked my self, Why they don't make a new modernization '''for Kaga and Akagi?'''

Historically both have undergone significant changes... '''The most significant change was the change from 3 to 1 single fly deck.''' But in the game both begins and get their Kai (1) with only a single fly deck. 

So, I ask: '''"Were Akagi and Kaga poorly designed for the game by the developers?"'''... 

I mean, Akagi and Kaga should have begin the game with 3 fly decks, with the capacity of only 60 planes, but being able to use Seaplanes and normal planes. And then on the Kai (I) both should be able to use normal planes.<ac_metadata title="Were Kaga and Akagi poorly designed for the game? (By the game developers)"> </ac_metadata>
