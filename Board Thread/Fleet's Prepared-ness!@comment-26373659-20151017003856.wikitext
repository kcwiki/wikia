Want some advice to ready my fleet for medium, (probably will only be able to clear easy :/)

Also got a blueprint, who should I give it to?

I know it's lacking, but I don't know what I should do to improve.

Any advice appreciated.

Hopefully I am not asking too much, thanks in advance!<ac_metadata title="What do I need to be ready for medium?"> </ac_metadata>
