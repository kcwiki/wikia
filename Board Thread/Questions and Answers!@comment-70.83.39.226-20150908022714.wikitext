Hi people. After the maintenance, the battle information in KC3 Kai seems broken. It doesn't detect anything at all for PVP. For PVE, it only shows the nodes that I go through, and the drop after the fight. Enemy ships are left blank without icons. It only shows sunk or not if I enter night battle.

I only cleared cache after maintenance. Is that an issue? I am not getting cat bombs though...<ac_metadata title="KC3 Kai battle info broken after maintenance?"> </ac_metadata>
