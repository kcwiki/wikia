I took a break from kancolle for a month or so. I now realize I missed a really silly quest to get a Keiun, that apparently are now super useful because of the jet update. I find myself with no jets whatsoever for the upcoming event and God knows when a new one will be avaiable (probably one on hard mode in the next event in a map that will obviously need 1-2 jets to clear?)

So yeah. Should I kill myself? Yes/No<ac_metadata title="Jets"> </ac_metadata>
