Hi, I'm a player coming back from a long hiatus.

I wanted to complete some of the ship-specific quests in order to unlock some of the newer quests, but didn't have enough space to keep every ship. Given that there's been multilpe new K2/buffs in my absence, I wasn't quite sure as to which ships are more relevant than others and which ones to scrap, so I wanted to get some advice.[[File:Ce6c5de5-d8fd-44e6-8659-3a01815f6e6d.png|thumb|Current list of ships]]

Thanks in advance!

P.S. Please don't worry about quest requirements (even if this post is about quests), I know it's a pain to consider quest chains/requirements so I'll check the candidates afterwards.<ac_metadata title="Which ships to scrap?"> </ac_metadata>
