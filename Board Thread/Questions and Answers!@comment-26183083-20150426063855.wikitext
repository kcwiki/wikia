OK, I know this is an unpopular topic. But the reality is, we only have 100 slots (unless you buy more - I already expanded my list TWICE), and you want at least 5 slots free so you can fill up the modernization box. That leaves you 95 ships and you have to throw out some.

So which ships are just weaker, with less potential, that barring "You Like Them" should be the first ones to become a modernization material?

Some ships I can think of are:

Mikazuki - she has no Kai-2, she's part the weakest class of destroyers, it doesn't look like there will be quest for her soon either. I like her (she's STILL my highest ranking destroyer) but not only does she max out earlier but it seems she literally grows slower than the other ships. I'm not dumping her but objectively I suspect I should.

Yura - I just fed her to Yuudachi in an attempt to buff her torp and armor (mostly her armor). Her stats are average, there's no quest ... etc. That was also when I dumped Natori by mistake before I rechecked the table realized she's with Nagara and Kuma. Crap. At least it is easy to get a re-issue of her....

Miyuki - an ordinary Fubuki-class. Shirayuki and Hatsuyuki also look due for dumping once I finish their Quests.

Are there any other ships you can think of?<ac_metadata title="Disposable Ships"> </ac_metadata>
