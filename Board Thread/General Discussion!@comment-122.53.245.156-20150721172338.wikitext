Can't they implement a fleet saving mechanism? Like being able to create a fleet, save and name it, so it would be easier to re-assemble them when you change ships? A playlist, but for shipgirls :/


It gets really tiring searching for ships especially when you have more than the initial 100 ship limit.<ac_metadata title="Saving and loading fleets?"> </ac_metadata>
