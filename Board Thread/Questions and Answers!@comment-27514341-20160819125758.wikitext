Hello.

This has never happened to me before, so I'm somewhat a bit concern. It first occurred when I was doing my E-2 spam run to farm ships, I thought it was just a one time problem. But so far, it's still occurring, interrupting at least 9 runs (checked on KC3Kai) before I could finish them.

What I tried was,
   1. Clearing my cache;
   2. Playing it on DMM without KC3Kai;
   3. Playing it on KancolleViewer.

The problem still persists though.
Is this caused by something on my side?
Is there anything I can do to solve it?
Or is this a problem that come and go?
