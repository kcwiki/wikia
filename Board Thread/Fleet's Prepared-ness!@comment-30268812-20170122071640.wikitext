So My second ever event, and I have been quite busy leveling ships since the last event. Still not exactly that experienced in level farming and what not but any way.

Currently my Resources are sitting at

29.3k Fuel/27.5KAmmo/47.9kSteel/33kBaux w/ 282Buckets.

So right now my priority is to Exp'd for Fuel and Ammo, and more buckets. (Btw just plan on doing Easy mode, unless Medium is do able but that just depends)

So for ships, what should I try to level up and or Prioritize.

and maybe just to level after the event?

*Also I dont think my Equipment list is showing everything I have*
