Its been a week since I accepted the B22 Sortie quest where you are tasked to sortie on the dreaded 3-2 map using the 4 Mutsuki class DD's (of which I recently obtained last week ago). I am trying to remodel them to kai then proceed on leveling them to 30 to boost their dodge rating for their mission. But I have my doubts... Could this small fleet be able to reach the boss node and end my misery? So thats why Im here ask... Could they do it? If not, what level can they be successful for this quest and what equipment setup should I put on these ships?

Anyway, here is my task force:

- Abukuma (L90) 2x 61cm O2 Quads and 1x Kyohoteki

- Mutsuki (L30) 2x 10cm HA 1x Damecon

- Kisaragi (L30) <span style="font-weight:normal;">2x 10cm HA 1x Damecon</span>

- Yayoi (L30) <span style="font-weight:normal;">2x 10cm HA 1x Damecon</span>

- Mochizuki (L30) <span style="font-weight:normal;">2x 10cm HA 1x Damecon</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">- Amatsukaze (L66) 2x 10 cm HAFD 1x Searchlight</span>
