<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Hello fellow TTK,</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">as my work allows me to play KC in between customers, i use that often to send short time expedition and sometimes to no-life at Events. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">But there is one problem playing reliably KC requires setting windows clock to JST. My work pc has many apps that are based on date and clock and i can't have it with 1 day difference. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">As i'm also Visual Novel player, some time ago have found application that helps me play some of em without unnecessary setting jugglery. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Here is application link:Â https://github.com/xupefei/Locale-Emulator/releases/download/v2.0.1.0/Locale.Emulator.2.0.1.0.zip </span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">After installing it U need to run LEGUI.exe to set profile. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Then right click on Ur browser shortcut and select: Locate emulator>Run it Japanese. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,10);font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Browser will be running with gtm+9 time zone and other system apps will be running with Ur local time set in windows</span><ac_metadata title="How to easily run KC with JST (gtm+9) without setting jugglery"> </ac_metadata>
