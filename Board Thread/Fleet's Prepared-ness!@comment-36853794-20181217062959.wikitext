[[File:Shiplistouran.jpg|thumb]]Here's my ship list and equipment list.

[[File:Equipment_List_2018-12-17.jpg|thumb]]For resources, I have:

Fuel: 22k, Ammo: 21k, Steel: 26k, and Bauxite: 10k (I'm starting bauxite farming right now, though.)

This is my first event and I want to do my best. I don't think I'll be able to level Abukuma to K2 by the time of the event, so I'm working on leveling characters like Yukikaze, Shimakaze, getting Kirishima and Hiryuu to K2, etc...

Are there any characters I should focus on leveling other than those ones? Is there any equipment I should spam-craft before the event? Thanks!<ac_metadata title="[Easy] Am I ready, and what should I improve?"> </ac_metadata>
