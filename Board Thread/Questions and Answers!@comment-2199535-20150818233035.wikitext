Hello,

i would like to ask about the boss meter in this years summer event. (I dont know if this applies to all boss meters)

I noticed that the boss meter has gone down a bit after winning a fight at the boss node without killing the flagship. Does this mean, that i "just" have to win the fight to empty it? Or have i actually to kill the flagship when the meter is completely empty?

Thanks =)<ac_metadata title="Boss meter (Summer event)"> </ac_metadata>
