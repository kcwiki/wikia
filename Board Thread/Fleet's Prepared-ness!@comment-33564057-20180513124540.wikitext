So, with the next event coming up I'm at a "Who the hell do i level from here" again (Ignore Suzuya and Ooyodo, I'm currently active levelling them)...also if Chitose/Chiyoda would drop on me to make myself some SPF that would be great.

I also have no idea what I should be using my 50+ screws on with Akashi. I've just been trading them 1 for 1 to slowly upgrade my 12.7cm to Kai B to use for Kai C fodder.

I don't have Intrepid as I was barely able to squeeze in getting Tashkent before I was leaving the country for a few weeks, sods law it happened mid event. Hopefully this one I'll get through.

NOTE: Not looking to complete on hard. Easy/Casual is my usual jam unless a catapult turns up for reward when I eventually craft Saratoga.<ac_metadata title="Here we go again."> </ac_metadata>
