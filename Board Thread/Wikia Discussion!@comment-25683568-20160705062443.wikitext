A proposal to change the translation of 特型内火艇 has been put forward by [[User:Qunow]].

After deliberation among community translators, the following changes are being proposed:

* Equipment category "特型内火艇" to be changed from "Special Amphibious Landing Craft" to "Special Amphibious Tank"
* Equipment "特二式内火艇" to be changed from "Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank"

The change from landing craft to tank was considered acceptable as the equipment category icon suggests all equipment in that category will be amphibious tanks.

ICE Craft and Motor Launch, among other alternative translations, were put forward but rejected due to the obscurity and lack of clarity of those terms.

After a period of 1 week, if there are no significant concerns raised the change will be implemented on this wiki (and probably KC3Kai and certain forks of KCV). <ac_metadata title="[RFC] Translation revision for 特型内火艇" related_topics="Special Type 2 Amphibious Landing Craft|Recent Updates|Suggestion|Installation Type"> </ac_metadata>
