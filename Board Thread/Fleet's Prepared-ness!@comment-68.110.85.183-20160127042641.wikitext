Alright guys, I've done quite a bit of research, so I think I'm in pretty good shape. On the offchance I'm not, lemme know.

I've been playing since the last week of the Fall event, obviously was way too new at that time to actually try it. I'm at 3 medals, HQ Level 79, trying desperately to farm Akashi. Cleared 2-5 what feels like about 25 times so far with no luck. 410 buckets, and 25-40k of every resource saved up.

Everything I could find suggested Abukuma for being a not-CLT CLT, or one of the Tone sisters as the strong CAVs for first blueprint. I have Chikuma and Abukuma ready for powerleveling, but really need to settle on one or the other. I don't really like either girl (Abukuma's voice :|) so which would be more beneficial?

I believe, besides CAV (which I'm leveling Kumano for right now,) I've got a pretty good coverage of ships, but let me know if you spot any holes I need to patch.

Lastly, I assume I'm best set up for Easy, but let me know if you think I have a shot at a higher difficulty.
