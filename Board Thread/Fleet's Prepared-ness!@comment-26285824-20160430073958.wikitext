So here I am once more to post something just to make others comment on me...

Kidding asides, I am not aiming something this time, but any kind of advice is fine for me (of course the ones that made sense is more welcome)

So here are my Ships and my equipments

Any responses is welcomed and appreciated. Thanks.<ac_metadata title="The &quot;I am not ready for Spring event&quot; post #546514635465174"> </ac_metadata>
