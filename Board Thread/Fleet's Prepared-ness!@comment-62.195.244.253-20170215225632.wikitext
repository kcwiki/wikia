I cant get past the first air node, aka E1 A I think. I have to take 3 fully fighter loaded carriers AND LBAS to pass without red damage (hopefully). But then I only have a CL and 2 dds for surface combat, any tips? Ps: please dont wave around anything above lv 25! I have only started playing 2~3 months ago, so I have a few ships around lv 25 from all classes. (Only 2 subs)<ac_metadata title="Stuck on aircraft node"> </ac_metadata>
