Been playing since early 2014 (first event was spring 2014). Was fine with events until the 2015 summer event (was forced to switch to med/eas for clearing/farming) and now I am having doubts about my event prep. I work full ime atm so time is an issue, especially since I found this forum so late (2 days before ZuiZui K2 patch).

My admiral lvl is 117 right now. For exp, I am currently spamming 2, 6/12, 38; I try to finish all dailies and Kuma is currently my flagship for pvp.

Any advice/tips is GREATLY appreciated.
