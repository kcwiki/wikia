this is my 2nd event, before that i failed to clear E-7 summer (mix diff) [[File:Ddx.png|thumb|DD]][[File:Cl(t).png|thumb|CL(T)]][[File:(f)bb(v).png|thumb|(F)BB(V)]][[File:Ca(v).png|thumb|CA(V)]][[File:Cv(l)(b).png|thumb|CV(L)(B)]][[File:Otherx.png|thumb|other]][[File:Reso.png|thumb|resoruces]][[File:Equipx.png|thumb|equip]]coz i only play for a month and get a lot of salt :D

for this event i am aiming to clear it on mixed diff, (depend on the reward), obviously i would like to try to clear it medium/hard on map which have a good reward
