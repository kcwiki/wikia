So.. here my story...

i already play from 2014, but i only enter 5-5 for 3 sortie (YES.. and that 3 sortie was HELL for me Nov-2014~Jan-2016) i have got 2 First Class Medal(Spring 2015 & Fall 2016), and ONLY 1 event i got All Hard(Spring). and that was a close victory... (My Resource was 80% gone). but Summer and Fall make my Confidence Drop to ZERO again... [[File:5-5_Drain.jpg|thumb|100px]]


Then i Try 5-5 This month to test my Fleet (All This Month EO were not touched). sure i got the medal (5-5)... but the cost was severe...

My Question is :

* Did something wrong with my fleet ?

* What chance for my fleet to get all hard ?

* What Should I do to make my fleet stronger ?

* How Much Resource do i need to safely clear this event (include the Drop)

* Did I make mistake on my equipment, or level gap ?

I am really need a solution. thank you in advance.
