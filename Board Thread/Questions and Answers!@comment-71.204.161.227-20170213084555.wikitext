I've been playing Kancolle since 2014, but I toned down playing around mid 2016. Between then and now, via various circumstances, I lost both the password to my email and the password to my account. I wanted to get back since there's a new event going on, but alas, I'm stuck here. I do not have a registered credit card on the account, but I do have a fair amount of information, courtesy of KanColle Command Center. Question is, if I compile my information into a ticket on the English version of the website, will I get a favorable response, and if not, what steps, if any, can I take to recover my account? Or is it a lost cause?<ac_metadata title="[Account Help] Resetting My Information"> </ac_metadata>
