Am I Only One having Cat Error Page after making ship ?

Making ship = > check = > error page 

--refresh and 3min passes--- 

and finally i can check what is the ship. 



And its not all 

Also While Repairing ships , remaining time is not correct , I mean there is a kind of delay.

For an example , when I repair a ship , remaining time was 5:00min 

after 5:00min , time becomes 0:00 and ship is not repaired yet !!

I need to click another menus and wait for a while (let's say4min ?) to reuse the repaired ship on the battle 



Am I only one having trouble with those stuffs thanks in advance<ac_metadata title="About the error page (cat page)"> </ac_metadata>
