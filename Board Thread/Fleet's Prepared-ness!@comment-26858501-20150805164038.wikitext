So this is probably my first event and I am quite excited to join. The problem is, am I going to survive? Hoping to get some tips from veteran admirals. Thanks in advance :)

I also read http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Shinhwalee/Major_Event_Preparation_Guide_for_Admirals though I doubt that my ships and equipments are enough for the event.

These are my resources currently available for the event. Probably going to save up for the next few days before the event.
