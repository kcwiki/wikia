I've heard that there is a new ducky coming soon, so decided to come back for The Salt.

What changed? and what do I need to focus on?

For info about my Fleet and Equip look at my wikia profile.

Thanks in advance, have all a nice day.<ac_metadata title="tryin&#039; to get back after 2 years..."> </ac_metadata>
