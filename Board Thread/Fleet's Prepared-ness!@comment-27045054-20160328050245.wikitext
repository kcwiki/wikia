As the title says, I need some advice to tackle the next event as I see many limitations in my current list of battle ready ships. I'll post all my used ships and can someone tell me what ships should I focus on for the next event? Don't mind the gear as I already have enough to use.

Well that's it. Keep note that these aren't all my ships, just my above lvl 20 ones. I apologize for the long list since my laptop can't take screenshots, and for how much of a noob I was for not training potential ships in my pre-mature days of Kancolle.
