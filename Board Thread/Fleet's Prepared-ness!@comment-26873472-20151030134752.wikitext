Hello, fellow TTKs.

This is my second event and I'm feeling fairly confident this time around.

I'm fully intent on clearing the event at all-medium at the very least.

My immediate concerns are my lack of fuel and buckets thanks to the recent fishing leaving me at 15k and 300, and maybe leveling my DDs some more, but aside from that I can't think of much else.

Any advice would be appreciated.
