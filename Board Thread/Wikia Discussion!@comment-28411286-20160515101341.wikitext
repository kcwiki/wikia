I'm just going to put this here. If I did something wrong, go ahead and yell at me so I do better next time.

There are missing character voices for character pages. It's not something I can fix, but I can point out which issues exist.

Night Attack missing: Pola, Harukaze, Oyashio

Kamikaze ''Kai'' - Intro, Secretary 3, Equip 1, Equip 2

Pola ''Kai'' - Secretary 2, Equip 1, Docking 1

Harukaze ''Kai'' - Secretary 1, Damaged 2

Iowa... takes a little more effort to describe. I'll write it up if this goes anywhere.

Also Ooyodo's event page lines, if those count for anything.

Hmm.. come to think of it, there are others on older character pages and I have a log of most of them, if interested.<ac_metadata title="Missing character voices"> </ac_metadata>
