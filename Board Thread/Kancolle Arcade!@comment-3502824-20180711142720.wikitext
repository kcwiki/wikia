SEGA Interactive and C2 Praparat representing 'KanColle Arcade' and to protect its Rights Preservation has filed a Copyright Infringement Lawsuit against MorningTec Japan representing 'Abyss Horizon' via Tokyo District Court today July 11th Wednesday, in order to stop the company from distributing the game 'Abyss Horizon' within Japan.

C2 Praparat has determined that the game 'Abyss Horizon' distributed by MorningTec Japan has been found to have infringed copyright in relations to their 'KanColle Arcade' Game, where they have determined that the company MorningTec Japan has gone against the Unfair Competition Prevention Law.

The C2 Praparat believes the contents they have created through preparations in a long period of time are very important, and will take the appropriate actions strictly against all others who conducts any similar acts. 

End.
