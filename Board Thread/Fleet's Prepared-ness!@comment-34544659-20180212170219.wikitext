Although I'm playing KanColle since October last year, my fleet seems less prepared than others from newer players... Many ships are at Level +-20, fortunately I powerleveled Musashi and Shimakaze (but got stuck with Hamakaze). My equipment also isn't really optimal, but some quest stuff helped (like two more Shiden Kai's). Like I said, I just want to TRY EASY, don't expect finishing thesecond map  event or even the whole event. With a lot of luck I get an event drop (no matter who, I will be very happy), but of Course I will try to finish it and ''give my best''.
These are my ships (I marked all <10 ships as not obtained, they don't really play a role) and equipment:
