Temporarily promotion of about 3 forum moderators to help on the event, who can edit and update report thread main posts (if the moderator performs well, the position may be retained even after event). The position is "Moderator" who can manage ''Forum Threads'' and ''Message Walls'', NOT a chat moderator who can kick people. [[Kancolle_Wiki:Staff#Moderators|See more about this position]].

Even though we already have branching rules and suggested compositions on the event page itself, it usually includes all possible compositions. The report threads main posts should be able to highlight '''only the popular ones used by many players'''

Starting this event, there will be two threads per map, one fleet compo, one for enemy encounters

'''<span style="color:#00f;">Fleet compo report threads</span>'''
* the report threads should still highlight in the main post on the '''best choice as reported by the people'''
* we'll need moderators to be able to '''read people's reports''' and e'''dit the main post''' on the popular compositions

'''<span style="color:#00f;">Enemy encounter report threads</span>'''
* mods to '''check people screenshots''' and '''edit the new enemy encounter template''' on the main post
* the new template was made from lua but '''you do not need to know lua''', just need to input enemy names, etc
* [[Template:NodeInfo|See this template and its usage]]

'''<span style="color:#00f;">Plus Factors</span>'''
* Higher edit counts could be a plus factor since it means you have a fair share of editing wikitext which would be important in this whole thing (editing the main post and fixing people's wrong-syntax reports)

'''<span style="color:#00f;">Other notes</span>'''
* Mods should edit player reports who weren't able to use the template correctly, e.g. wrong syntax or template usage 
* It is best to have people from different timezones, so please put your local time as well
* '''[[User:ArcticaFrost|ArcticaFrost]] will be the final judge.'''
