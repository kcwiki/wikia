I have ~50 destroyers I want to level up. I need to know the absolute fastest method to level them all up, hopefully having at least 10 of them at either Kai Ni level or level 70 well before the next event so I can stockpile more resources in preperation. I'm currently using 4-3 and am at HQ lv 105, so 1-5 probly isn't an option. Any suggestions would be helpful!<ac_metadata title="Fast leveling of a large number of destroyers."> </ac_metadata>
