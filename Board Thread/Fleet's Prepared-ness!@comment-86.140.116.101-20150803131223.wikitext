For Combined fleet maps I plan to use Akagi, Kaga, Souryuu and Hiryuu and I am wondering what would be some good plane setups for good offensive power, strong air power and a balance of both. I will be attempting medium difficulty.

Planes I have:

Suisei (6O1), Tenzan (6O1), Type 99 (Egusa), Type 97 (Tomonaga), 4 Suisei 12, 4 Ryuusei, 4 Type 62 (Fighter Bomber), 2 Type 21 (Skilled), 6 Reppuu, 4 Shiden Kai Ni, Saiun and Type 2 Reconnaisance.Â 

As flagship, Akagi will also be equipped with Fleet command facility when needed.<ac_metadata title="Optimal Plane Setup in Combined Fleet"> </ac_metadata>
