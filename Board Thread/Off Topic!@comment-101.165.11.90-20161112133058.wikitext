Does anyone here have experience with these? I'm looking at possibly getting a model ship of one of my favourite girls. I know there is a wide variety of plastic kits of various quality and sizes, but I am leaning more toward a pre assembled model.

This website is a perfect example of what i'm looking for, however the prices are quite high.

Does anyone know of any websites that sell something similar to that, except maybe a bit cheaper?

I have built quite a few models over the years, mainly gunpla, as well as some other stuff as well but I am no expert modeller. I know the feeling of satisfaction you get after completing a model and getting all the little details right. What I want though is a really high quality piece that I can display in a prominent location, and I am doubtful that my model building skills would be up to creating a piece that met my standards. Specifically the painting, I'm no good at the painting and don't own an airbrush or anything, and the paintjob is usually everything. You can make a $5 model look like $1000 if your'e a good painter, but a $1000 model will just look like a cheap plastic toy if you're not.<ac_metadata title="Model Ships"> </ac_metadata>
