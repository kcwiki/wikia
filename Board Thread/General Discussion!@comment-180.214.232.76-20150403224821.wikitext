<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">now i read somewhere that to get heavily damaged you need to get your ship below 40% HP, is this right?</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">i read some ppl saying that he/she sink their ship even though it's still in moderate damage, if the 40% is right, my dechi is still in moderate damage with 4/14 HP, which is below 40% (around 28%), is there anyone can confirm about sinking in moderate damage but with HP below 40%, it might be the real sinking treshold, not just getting heavily damaged,</span>
