The normal maps have stars indicating how hard they are, the real question is what level should my ships be at in order to clear Â certain maps like 4-4 or 6-3. Also how long does it take for newcomers to be prepared for events on hard mode? I just finished this event on easy with sheer luck so it feels like I won't be able to do events on hard until 2018.<ac_metadata title="Map clearing levels and event hard mode."> </ac_metadata>
