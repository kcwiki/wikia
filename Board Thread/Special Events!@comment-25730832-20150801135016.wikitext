This is an attempt to gather fleet composition reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-4</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Summer 2015 Event]] comments.

'''Important Notes for Template'''
* This is '''optional''' so it is not a requirement for fleet report.
* Instruction of how to use this template is [[Template:EventComp|here]].
* Admins and Moderators may edit or remove posts that contain template mishaps or intentional attempts to break the mechanism.

'''What should not be posted here'''
* Enemy encounters. Please post enemy screenshots on the [[Thread:292550|enemy report thread here for E-4]].

'''Suggested Compositions'''

'''Prefinal or Easy mode Suggested Composition:'''

'''* Kongou  & Haruna OR Kirishima & Hiei'''''', 2 DD, 1 CA/V, 1 CVL ''''''Route: B-D-F-H-Z.'''



'''Hard Mode Final Clear Suggested Composition:'''

'''* 3 Kongou class 1 CV 1 CVL 1 CA/V.  Route: B-D-E-G-Z.   '''

'''* (Replace 1 Kongou with CA/V if insufficient Kongou class).  Around 225 AS for Air superiority at final form of boss (not including experience).  '''

'''This composition goes through the night battle node in exchange for being able to bring CV to achieve air superiority, which makes clearing much easer.'''<ac_metadata title="[Summer 2015 Event] E-4 - Fleets"> </ac_metadata>
