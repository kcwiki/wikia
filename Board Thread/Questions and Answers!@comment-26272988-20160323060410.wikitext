I like to ask whether anyone know the attack order for CVs/CVLs?

Let say for a fleet consisting of just CVs with full t<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;">orpedo bomber planes. Which CV get to attack first in the shelling phase? Is it depending on her fleet position or plane capacity or anything at all?Â </span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;">If there is one, does it change if the type of plane use or if CVLs are added into the fleet.</span>



Not a major concern but love if somebody can kindly explain this to me.<ac_metadata title="In game CV and CVL shelling phase attack order"> </ac_metadata>
