First of all I've to say that English is not my native language so please forgive me if I sound funny / weird.

I started playing Kancolle about 2-3 weeks before the saury / mackerel pike mini event so this would be my second big event after Fall 2015. I'm HQ 101 right now and I intend to go all hard if possible since the upcoming event is a small scale event. If there are nodes that drop ships that I want/need and it's quite troublesome to farm it on either medium/hard, I'll go easy/medium to farm before clearing the map on hard.

<span style="font-weight:normal;">I plan to go medium/hard mix </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">if you think my ships are not good enough and is not advisable to go all hard. Here's some screenshots of the ships I have right now.</span>

<p style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Note (1): I don't have '''''Asashimo''''' and '''''Kiyoshimo'''''.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Note (2): For Auxiliary ships I have only '''''Akitsu Maru + Akashi + Kashima''''' and all of them are low leveled.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">

<p style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">This is my training list I plan to complete before I challenge the event.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">'''DD''' - Ushio (Lv70), Akizuki (Lv70), Kasumi (Lv85), Yuudachi (Lv85), Shigure (Lv90)</span></p>

'''CL(T) '''- Isuzu (Lv75)

'''CA(V)''' - Ashigara (Lv70), Maya (Lv80), Nachi (Lv70)

'''CV(L/B)''' - Chitose (Lv70), Graf Zeppelin (Lv80)

'''(F)BB(V)''' - Littorio (Lv75), Yamashiro (Lv80)

'''SS''' - [None]

Please say so if there's some other ships that I should train instead of the ships listed above / if there are some other ships that I should add in.



<u>'''Blueprint'''</u>

I have 3 medals right now and I'm in a dilemma of whom I should give it to once I get my hand on a blueprint next month. I'm not sure which one will benefit me the most during the upcoming event. Those in the list are:

- Fusou / Yamashiro (soon)

- Littorio

- Shoukaku

- Tone

Note: I already have Abukuma, Choukai and Zuikaku kai ni'd.



<u>'''Equipment'''</u>

'''[[File:My_equipment.png|left]]'''

I had just recently acquired Akashi myself so I don't have much upgraded equipment yet. For now I upgrade Type 91 AP Shell daily. Any advice on the equipment I should craft / upgrade right now will be greatly appreciated.



<u>'''Resources'''</u>

Lastly, for my resources, I've '''<u>2</u><u>5k Fuel, 25k Ammo, 28k Steel and 25k Bauxite</u> (Softcap is 26k at HQ 101)'''. I've been staying at softcap to craft equipment/level up ships. I've <u>'''492 Buckets'''</u> right now.

In conclusion, what should I do now since there're only two weeks left till the event? Any advice/guidance will be helpful, thank you very much for your time! c:<ac_metadata title="My second event! (All hard or medium/hard mixed?)"> </ac_metadata>
