So I just realize this part on Combat section

[[File:SnapShot_151029_103902.jpg|thumb]]Now I'm pretty confused which torpedo bomber should I use on next event, aside from Tomonaga, Murata Sq, Ryuusei 601. Is it better for me to keep stick on Ryuusei Kai or switch to another weaker bomber but better accuracy like Type 97 Torpedo Bomber (Skilled)? I really do believe that next event, we will have to use Carrier Task Force again.

Ofc I have plan to farm Hiryuu for her Type 97 Tomonaga, but that's in the future, since untill now, I only focused on Egusa farming. Â Any suggestion about this?

Thanks for your time.[[File:SnapShot_151030_105414.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Need suggestion on my Torpedo Bomber load-out"> </ac_metadata>
