Someone at the comment section of Type 0 Fighter Model 53 (Iwamoto Squadron) equipment page claimed that using a max stars type 21 skilled to start the quest, the <span style="font-weight:normal;">Type 0 Fighter Model 53 (Iwamoto Squadron) we get in the end will have 2 bonus AA stats. Can someone verify this? is the </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">Type 0 Fighter Model 53 (Iwamoto Squadron) get 14 AA instead of the normal 12 AA? or just the stars are transferred to the </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">Type 0 Fighter Model 53 (Iwamoto Squadron)? He/she also mentioned that the 601 quest line is also the same. </span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, will the same thing apply to the iwai flight quest line?</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">I'm about to do the quest so any help is appreciated. Thanks. </span><ac_metadata title="Zuikaku&#039;s Iwamoto Flight Chain Quest"> </ac_metadata>
