Ok I lied, a 15 minute drive down the thruway isn't a big adventure, but it's still some cool shit.

I've never been one to discuss who I am or where I live but there's no hiding my hometown with this post, and because I have the opportunity to see some shit that not all Kancolle players get too, I figured I had to share.... so fuckit.

http://buffalonavalpark.org/  I'd been there once as a child, I don't recall who took me or when it was but I recall crawling around the ships, it's been a good 15-20 years since then and I'd completely forgotten about the Naval park because I avoid downtown like the plauge, untill last week when I had to pick a friend up from work and saw the masts of some warships poking up over the skyway. It was never a matter of "if" I'd go but when... Today was a nice day out and I had off of work so... it's as good as anyother. A 15 minute drive and 12$ later I was balls deep in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_The_Sullivans_(DD-537) USS The Sullivans] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Little_Rock_(CL-92) USS Little Rock]  and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Croaker USS Croaker]. 

Here just a few of the 220 pics I took (imgur is still uploading them all)
