I have a question regarding when the game data is sent to the server after the boss fight.

Today I try to finish my monthly 4-5. After the day battle at boss node, I clicked "Night battle" and suddenly, error musume strike and I thought I lost all of my progress.

However, when I reconnect the game, 4-5 has already been cleared and I got the medal. I thought the game would update the status of Boss HP after I reach the summary screen. But this doesn't seem to be the case for what happened today. Did they change the mechanic or has my understanding been wrong all along?

Thank you<ac_metadata title="About how boss HP mechanic work in case of disconnection."> </ac_metadata>
