I was wondering, when i started playing this game you receive your first ship and go on. The question is, what happen if you sunk all your ship oO? Is this even allowed? A some sort of Game Over will occur? Or you will only get stucked ?

I'm curious, anyone has info about this?<ac_metadata title="Game Over?"> </ac_metadata>
