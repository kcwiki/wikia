The case regarding validity/reasons of "Redirect Links" for memtic/joke names of kanmusu has been coming up again and again over the past few month so I took the chance to compiled it into this thread to stop myself from looking it up again.

This should also help some people who wonder about the reason these 'redirects' still exist and if they ever want to put in opinion about it can do so (please put it here instead, those listed are pretty much necro'd).

<u>List of Kanmusu Examples that is technically List of Redirects:</u>
</center>

'''Legit:'''

[[Goya]], [[Imuya]], [[Hachi]], [[Shioi]], [[Iku]], [[Ryuuhou]], [[Ro]] and [[Ro-500]], [[Verniy]] & [[Верный]]

Names that are accepted as alternate name for Ship via their remodel, Devs or just how they report themselves. (e.g. Goya said "You can call me Goya")

'''Pronunciation Correction''':

[[Chokai]], [[Fuso]], [[Hiryu]], [[Hosho]], [[Kongo]], [[Kagero]], [[Oi]], [[Shirasuyu]]

We ain't perfect in spelling and Jap -> Romanji sometimes doesn't go well. 

'''Fan-made Name''':

[[Beaver]], [[Bucky]]/Bukki, [[Airport]], [[Guncannon]], [[Hotel]], [[Hoppou]], [[Lady]], [[Melon]] & [[Melon-chan]] & [[Melon chan]], [[Nagamon]], [[Ooichi]], [[Rabbit]] & [[Rensouhou-chan]], [[Sushi]], [[Turkey]], [[すでのな]], [[Kaminari]] - Also part of "Name Reading"

The meme part. Anything that was joked around then become a trend that won't stop.

'''Name Reading:'''

[[RJ]] - RyuuJou, [[Ktkm]] - KiTaKaMi

How a kanmusu's name is 'kinda' read or the shorten version of it. 

'''Over-the-top-quotes:'''

[[Nanodesu]],[[BURNING LOVE]], [[Khorosho]], [[Nya]], [[Panpakapaan]] & [[Panpakapan]], [[Warawa]], [[Wagahai]], [[Poi]], [[Pyon]]

Pretty much stuffs that became popular due to the kanmusu's famous line or just their verbal tic.

'''Lel-wut?: '''

[[Hinata]], [[Den]], [[Flag Ship]], [[💃]], [[👯]], [[🐻]], [[🍝]], [[🍕]],[[🇬🇧]] 

Lel what!?
