Hello everyone,

So far, I've cleared E-1 through E-4 on hard difficulty. I tried to save the best ships for last, using lv43 Hatsuzuki, lv51 Mogami, lv52 Noshiro, lv53 Yahagi as well as Takao/Atago/Kako/Furutaka for the first 4 maps.

Below is my current planned ships for E-5 (highlighted) and E-6 (circled). I circled 18 ships just in case I need to modify my fleet. All feedback/comments/criticism are appreciated!!

Here are some questions I have: 

1. Is there any possibility that I'll need Fusou k2 for E-6? That's the reason why I'm currently planning to use Ise/Hyuuga for E-5. Would I have to remodel Yamashiro?

2. I only realized this morning that tanks/landing forces are ineffective at E-5 and E-6... I guess could still use Kasumi/Kawakaze/Ooshio since they have good stats, but did I prepare 2 Abukuma k2 for nothing? 

EDIT: Maybe I should equip tanks for E-6 since there are 2 artillery imps, not sure

3. What are the chances of completing the event on all-hard, or even E-6M + E-7H? I'm planning to use the 4CV2DD boss support expedition for E-6 in hopes of one-shotting the boss xD
