This is an attempt to gather all reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-5</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Winter 2015 Event]] comments.

Please use this template to get included in the counting
<pre>
{{Fleet
|BB|BB|CV|CA|CA|DD|
|Route = A - H - C - E
}}
</pre>
'''Important Notes for Template'''
* You will have to report ship names, their levels and equipment '''separately'''. '''Do not include it into the template'''
* For compositions less than 6 ships, please still '''include the vertical bars''' | of the remaining ships.
* '''For a combined fleet mechanic, only include the first fleet on the template'''. However, please add the second fleet separately on your post since it seems to affect the branching for this map.
* Admins and Moderators may edit or remove posts that contain template mishaps or intentional attempts to break the mechanism.

'''Other helpful data you can post'''
* HQ Level
* Equipment LoS (special formula) and Total LoS
* Formation used each node and general analysis of the node

'''Other notes'''
* Screenshots are allowed, esp enemy patterns
* Branching theories or general tips are also welcome
