Started after the summer event ended and I'm quite a lazy person (occasional player).

Planning to go for Easy and some or 1 medium stage that contains the ship that are restricted to only normal/hard.

My HQ is currently 79lvl.

I have about 370 buckets and these are of my resources -> (48500 26371 40377 23245)

Doing orel over here and hopefully I'll have enough rsc for both the event and leveling Kumano and Mogami... still havn't acquire any CAV T.T
