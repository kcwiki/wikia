Unlucky me, I got hacked a week before the event. The hacker deconstructed my Haruna Kai2, Kongo Kai2, and Murakumo Kai2. Has the admins ever reset/restore a person's account when they are hacked? Please help a fella out! ><<ac_metadata title="Will the admins reset my account after it has been hacked?"> </ac_metadata>
