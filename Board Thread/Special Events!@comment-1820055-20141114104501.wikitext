This is an attempt to gather all reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-4</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Fall 2014 Event]] comments.

It would be helpful, but '''not mandatory''', to include these information if available:
* HQ Level
* Equipment LoS (special formula) and Total LoS
* Route - the nodes or the direction your fleet went
* Fleet Composition
** Equipment setup
* Formation used - ''for those treading the map for the first time''
* Screenshots are fine


'''Non-composition reports, e.g. branching theories or general tips are also good'''

'''Posting of enemy pattern screenshots are very welcome'''<ac_metadata title="[Fall 2014 Event] Reports: E-4" related_topics="Fall 2014 Event"> </ac_metadata>
