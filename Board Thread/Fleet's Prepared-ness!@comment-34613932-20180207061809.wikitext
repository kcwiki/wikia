[[File:Helpthepoorlittle2LT.png|thumb]][[File:Kwappa.png|thumb]]This took me a while to realize that the ^ bar up there is the title. 

I'm not the brightest person around here.




Anyways,

Resources: 

59K Fuel, 47K Ammo, 92K Steel, 27K Bauxie, 366 Buckets.

Equipment:[[File:Quack.png|thumb]]

As KC3 doesn't want me exporting my equipment (apparently, see the Equipment List photo)

I'll explain it via words. 

Most of the equipment boxes have been checked, although most of it has been either stolen from the ship-girls or gained through quests. 2 primary concerns are the Seaplane Fighters and the LBAS Bombers.

Well, I say Seaplane Fighters, I really only mean one, which is a Type 2 Seaplane Fighter I got from Akashi (and during the Fall 2017 Event for E-4 in the nick of time). 

Secondly, the LBAS Bombers are very low in quality, only a Type 1 LBAA and a couple of old Type 96 LBAAs I got from crafting. 




Ship-Girls:

Yeah, judge it for yourself, but I'm considering a number of options for last-minute grinding. I have a BP I can create by clearing 2-5 and 3-5 (if I find the sanity), but I'm also considering saving the BP for Mush-Mush. 

Conclusion:

I'M FFUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCC-

I mean, I'm currently in a bad position in terms of my resources and ships, as I basically planned January as a 'grind Yamato (not that way...?) to marrying level'. Otherwise, I planned very little in January in terms of resource gaining and other ship-girls leveling. Well, any help is helpful. <ac_metadata title="Event Preparations- Easy/Medium Running"> </ac_metadata>
