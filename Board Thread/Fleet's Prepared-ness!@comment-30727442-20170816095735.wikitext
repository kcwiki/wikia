<p style="font-weight:normal;">Hey guys, I've been doing this event a little bit and managed to clear up to and including E3-E. I wanted to clear E3-N initially, but it proved more difficult than I had anticipated and had to go for an Easy clear with a CTF on both phases. That little hell took me exactly 30 sorties to complete, dropping my sanity quite significantly and I'll admit I'm a little bit worried if I'll be able to complete the event.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">My goals were to clear E1-E2 on Easy, E3-N, E4-E, E5-N, E6 Easy or Normal and E7-E. The ships I would want to farm the most are Prinz, Graf, Warspite, Taigei, Mikuma and the Akizuki-class. Everything else would be optional, however my wishlist is pretty long as I'm a fairly fresh player lacking many event- or later map-exclusive ship girls.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">I've used about 12k fuel, 10k ammo, 6k steel and 4k bauxite so far.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Please help, I need your opinions.</p>
