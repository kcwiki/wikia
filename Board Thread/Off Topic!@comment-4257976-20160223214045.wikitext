So as of late i just recently found this ripoff game on facebook called "Navy Girls" thats for the iphone. it uses the BGM from kancolle, Also it uses the voices aswell. along with using the opening theme from the anime when you open the app xD;; 

Other than using the girls that allready exist theres apparently more girls that they have created themselves. <ac_metadata title="The latest Kancolle rip off game!"> </ac_metadata>
