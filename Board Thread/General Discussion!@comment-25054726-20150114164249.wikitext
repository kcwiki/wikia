hello as stated above im quite new to the game, about 1 week or so and i want to confirm some stuff



1. does 1 unit with Radar have a effect in your whole fleet, (ex. yer fleet have 6 Units and 1 Unit have 1 Radar), also the Sonar..

2. im running a Main Fleet of 4 Heavy Cruiser, 1 Carrier, 1 Light Carrier is it good enough for the start till later?? im not yet planning to add a Battleship on my Fleet coz i read that they consume a lot of Ammo/Fuel

3. what does luck do?? crit only of does it affect other stats?

4. which is better double atk or cut-ins?

5. what stat to raise to effectively hit the enemy without miss? or is it just base on RNG??

6. before the battle start there is a plane like scouting, then there will be a UP or DOWN thing that will pop what does it raise and lowered? is that the artillery spotting or im wrong?

7. for carrier what is the usual setup? im running with 2 slot of fighter and 2 slot of torpedo bomber, which is better Torpedo Bomber or Dive Bomber?

8. lol why is it my torpedo arent hitting the enemy subs? torpedo is not a great option?

9. for ASW which is better Destroyer or Light Cruisers?



sorry for so many question but i really enjoyed the game and i want to learn how the game works,<ac_metadata title="New Player here and i have some questions~~"> </ac_metadata>
