I'm a new player and only played for about 4 days and already at HQ level 9 and I'm already at map 2-2.

This is the ships that I currently Have

1 BB: Fuso

5 CA: Mogami, Chikuma, Maya, Kako, Ashigara

CVL: Jun'you

AV: Chitose

CL: Kitakami, Sendai, Kiso, Tama, Kuma, Tatsuta, Naka, Jintsuu, Isuzu

DD: Too many to list :P

So far I'm using Fuso as FS and the 5 CA for the other slots. I can clear maps easily but it takes a long time to repair them. So with my current ships what should I level, keep, or leave alone for now? Is it ok to concentrate first on leveling noteworthy DDs like Fubuki and Yuudachi? or concentrate on CLs?<ac_metadata title="Fleet composition for lowbies, need some advice"> </ac_metadata>
