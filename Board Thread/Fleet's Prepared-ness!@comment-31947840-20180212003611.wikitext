It's more for the peace of mind than anything, but what should I pay more attention to? Planning on waiting out first few days, gaining resourses (currently 64k/65k/158k/47k and 357 buckets) until the info comes out. I'm going to finish EOs for a BP, but think I'll keep it until Event start. But seeing my average DD levels main question is: Should I actively level someone and if so, who I should focus on?[[File:32d344a9-6240-47f5-a417-41c0ef3b3d31.png|thumb]][[File:1802ef6f-01f5-41e5-b637-df97dd428680.png|thumb]][[File:800f6252-4127-4668-9263-0a2eb8b343bc.png|thumb|left]]<ac_metadata title="[Mostly Medium] Can&#039;t be that bad, no?"> </ac_metadata>
