Preparation for 2-4

Senpai,

I am just playing this game by 3 days ago so i need senpais advice regarding Map 2-4.



I do read the guide in the wikipedia

"A more conventional way to finish 2-4 is using 「BBx4 CVx2」or「BBx3 CVx3」. (BBs are stronger; Modernizing/Leveling them is highly recommended)."





and so, i build some BB lovely and now this is my formation...

[[File:Squadthade.png|thumb]]since i need to level up my BB's team first, can you guys give me advise what map should i grinding for? material efficiency wise..

and what level should i aim for before i do 2-4..



note: equipment still standard, should i forge better equipment from them? or standard equip could finish 2-4?<ac_metadata title="World 2-4"> </ac_metadata>
