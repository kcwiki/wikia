I wish I could have participated in the Winter 2018 event when it was active. I started playing in May 2018, three months after the said event had ended. It was a major event and I feel like I've missed out on something Important.

Anyone else ever feel like they've missed out in participating in any of the past Kancolle events and wish they could have a chance to replay any of them at all?<ac_metadata title="Does anyone ever wish that they could replay past Kancolle events?"> </ac_metadata>
