Started playing right as Spring Event ended. Just wondering if I can somehow do the upcoming event on easy mode.

Currently starting to train my severly underlevelled CAs like Choukai, Myoukou, Ashigara, Maya, etc. as well as some destroyers.

I think I can somehow get 2 blueprints by next month too.

Resource-wise, I'm pretty screwed, I know, with only my ammo in the 5 digits. Also currently doing expeditions 2,5,6 extremely frequently [yes I'm desperate for buckets]

Main goal for this post is to predict how far I can go and how screwed I am, as well as some last-minute powerlevelling.[[File:Ship_List_2017-07-07.jpg|thumb]][[File:Equipment_List_2017-07-07.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="In need of desperate advice"> </ac_metadata>
