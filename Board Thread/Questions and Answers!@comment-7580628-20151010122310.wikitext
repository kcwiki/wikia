I have been using kc3kai for a while and its good, however, there is a quest glitch in my kc3kai which doesnt really matter much though, but still want to get rid of it if possible



[[File:Untitledmfb4016.png|thumb|400px]]As you can see, there is the " Exp 23 " quest that i completed long time ago, however, when i completed it, kc3kai didnt make it disappear and it still shows up to today even i completed it



Is there any way to get rid of it?<ac_metadata title="A quest glitch in kc3kai"> </ac_metadata>
