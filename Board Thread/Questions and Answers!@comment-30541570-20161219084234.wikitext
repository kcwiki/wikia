So, after an hour of trying to register my Visa debit card, which sucessfully did, i tried to buy 500 DMM points. When i was about to checkout, i received this message:

ご利用のクレジットカードはお使いいただくことができません。

クレジットカード登録ページより別のクレジットカードをご登録ください。

or

You can not use your credit card.

Please register another credit card from the credit card registration page.



I don't know what it means, but my card is loaded with around $5. I think it has something to do with the number of tries you've registered your card, but i've no idea. Can anyone help me on this matter?<ac_metadata title="I can&#039;t use (Not register) my card in purchasing points." related_topics="Shop/Purchasing"> </ac_metadata>
