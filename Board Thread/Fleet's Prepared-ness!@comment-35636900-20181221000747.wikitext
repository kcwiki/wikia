Right, I am pretty sure I am set up for the event (at least, I hope so). However, I am not sure if I should spend my blueprints on Ise, Nagato, Yamashiro, Bismarck, Littorio, Chikuma, or Yura. I probably won't spend them on Ooshio or Arare anytime soon, after all. I have 3 blueprints worth, 4 action reports and a spare proto. deck catapult. Looking at my team, which shipgirl should I kai ni/level for the event? Thanks in advance.[[File:Ship_List_2018-12-21.png|thumb]][[File:Equipment_List_2018-12-21.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Event Preparation - Blueprints"> </ac_metadata>
