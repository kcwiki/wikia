My first large scale event.(Joined after Summer 2015)

My resources are in a very bad state. My bucket count is very poor as well, hoping to get 450+ before the event begins.

How much resources should I hoard before feeling safe?[[File:List0.png|thumb]][[File:List1NNK.png|thumb]][[File:List2NNK.png|thumb]][[File:List3NNK.png|thumb]][[File:Showcase0.png|thumb]][[File:Showcase1NNK.png|thumb]][[File:EquipmentNK.png|thumb]]

Is it possible to run through the event on medium?<ac_metadata title="Full Medium possible?"> </ac_metadata>
