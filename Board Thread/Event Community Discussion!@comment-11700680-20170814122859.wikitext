The event comment section can get pretty big, and that means many useful compositions get lost in the HELP ME spam from so many people. While lying in bed trying to sleep, I came up with the idea make a place where people could put their clear compositions into one place, and simply link that to people who need help.

PLEASE stick to ONE (1) post per person, there is no point to this if it becomes as cluttered as the event comments. 

Requirements:

-A picture of your fleet(s)

-Information that might not be shown, such as the number of stars on improved items, or items with similar names with small differences at their ends that are cut off, and luck modding

-LBAS composition if available

-Formations for each node

-Any specific tips in case someone might hit a roadblock on the map 

If anyone with better knowledge of setting something like this up would be willing to do so, please do. I am a bit surprised somethinglike this was never set up, since a similar thing was done for resource usage.<ac_metadata title="Fleet Composition Archive"> </ac_metadata>
