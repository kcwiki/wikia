Based on posts I've been reading, I think I can only afford to do easy mode, and even then hopefully no shiplocking in easy. Would like to hear if:

- is it even possible to do Normal, and if yes what should I do during this preparation stage?

- what other preparations should I do for Easy mode?

Thanks!<ac_metadata title="Prepared for Easy?"> </ac_metadata>
