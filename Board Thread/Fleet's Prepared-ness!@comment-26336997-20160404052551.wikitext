From now on, i'm working on improving my fleet, including Kai Nis some shipgirls. My next goal is either Ooshio Kai 2 or Zuikaku Kai 2. Can't decide which one will go because i just have one spare BP for the next month.

PS: i'm crafting a new Daihatsu Landing Craft, just in case if it's a MUST HAVE equipment for the upcoming event.

Any advices are appreciated. Thanks so much!<ac_metadata title="Fleet improvement recommendations for Spring Event 2016"> </ac_metadata>
