Hello all, this oddity happened just now in PvP battle. Note that I does not have any planes joining air battle phase but Fusou did an AACI and I guess that brings me an AS+. It's really an AS+ because three of my ships was able to do CI & DA. IIRC, AACI does not help at gaining AS when I last read about it. But then, why and how did I get an AS+?
