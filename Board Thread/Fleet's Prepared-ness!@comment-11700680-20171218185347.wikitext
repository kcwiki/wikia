So, how does one go about doing this? I've looked up some stuff about this map, yet every setup I've tried (admitedly I have only tried 2 compositions), has had issues getting to the boss, let alone actually sinking it. So, would someone mind helping me set up a fleet and LBAS capable of clearing this map? I'm fine with leveling up a few ships as is needed, though more seaplane fighters would be an issue.[[File:Ship_List_2017-12-19.jpg|thumb]][[File:Equipment_List_2017-12-19.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Clearing 6-4."> </ac_metadata>
