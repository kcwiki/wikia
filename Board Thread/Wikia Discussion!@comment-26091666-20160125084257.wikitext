Loosely basing ideas off [[Sandbox/Situation_room|this page]].

As of T.B.A., Kantai Collection English Wikia staffers that are able to help out for [[Winter 2016 Event]] are (inconclusive list):
* [[User: Admiral Mikado | Admiral Mikado]]
* [[User: Dechidechi | Dechidechi]]
* [[User: SmokeyTheButt | SmokeyTheButt]]
* [[User: HandgunOtonashi | HandgunOtonashi]]
* [[User: Ar-cen-ciel | Ar-cen-ciel]]
* [[User: Crazy teitoku | Crazy teitoku]]
* [[User: McDerp| McDerp]]
* [[User: Kevadu | Kevadu]]
* [[User: Segar | Segar]]

As is with virtually every new event, there will be new ships, equipments, CG, etc to be implemented on the wiki. Currently, three staffers are able to help out:
* [[User: Ckwng | Ckwng]]
* [[User: がか | がか]]
* [[User: Crazy teitoku | Crazy teitoku]]
More hands on board for this area might be beneficial.

Front runners on TeamSpeak (TS), TeamSpeak listeners and other related people are:
* [[User: ArcticaFrost | ArcticaFrost]]
* [[User: Admiral Mikado | Admiral Mikado]]
* [[User: CDRW | CDRW]]
* [[User: SmokeyTheButt | SmokeyTheButt]]
* [[User: Dechidechi | Dechidechi]]
* [[User: HandgunOtonashi | HandgunOtonashi]]
* [[User: Hossinator | Hossinator]]
* [[User: Kevadu | Kevadu]]
* [[User: Crazy teitoku | Crazy teitoku]]
* [[User: EchoHolic | EchoHolic]]
* [[User: SerialConvort | SerialConvort]]
* [[User: Nanamin | Nanamin]]
* [[User: McDerp | McDerp]]
It is currently unknown at this stage if more people are needed in this field or not. Also do note that the aforementioned list does not imply all users above are necessarily front runners. Mods/admins, edit this accordingly.

Currently the [[Winter 2016 Event]] page is somewhat based off the [[Sandbox/Winter 2016 Event|Sandboxed variant of Winter 2016 Event]] made by [[User:Dragonjet|Dragonjet]]. The original framework is still very much based off from what was the [[Fall 2015 Event]] which was based off [[Sandbox/Event|Event sandbox page]] jointly created by [[User:Fujihita|Fujihita]], [[User:Crazy teitoku|Crazy teitoku]] as well as [[User:がか|がか]]. A few changes took about, notably with now the use of:
* [[Template:Event/Timers]]
* [[Template:Route]]

Old Templates that were used for the previous event has been noted as below:
* [[Template:DropList]]
* [[Template:ItemStack]]
* [[Template:ShipBattleCardKai]]
* [[Template:Node]]

Following from [[Thread:350785|Sitrep room for Fall 2015 Event]]:

'''To all staff members,'''

Leave a [[Help:Signature|signature with timestamp]] next to the area(s) you're moderating. Remove your signatures when you're off duty and resign the next time you log in.</div>

Below is the listing of areas that need moderation during events. The sub-areas are sorted from highest to lowest priority. <span style="color:red">Marked in red</span> are recurring areas that will require several active moderators.

Also we will need to either:
* Open the temporary moderator application out to the public. Or,
* Recommend suitable candidates for temporary moderator application and to have it enacted by admins. Note, suitable candidates must be available during the duration of the event and it is up to admins to have their final say on whether or not recommended candidates are suitable for this voluntary position. Or,
* Vote on a handful of already pre-selected candidates.

Other stuff I have not included here will be included perhaps later on as needed. '''Mods/admins''' if you have other things you want to include in this thread, please do so accordingly.<ac_metadata title="Sitrep room for Winter 2016 Event"> </ac_metadata>
