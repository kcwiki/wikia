hmmm, Hello!!!

I would like to ask for the opinion of some experienced admirals than me about my Fleet for the event that is coming xD

So far I participated in three events since I started playing, and I could only get to the end in the last (Spring 2015); where I did it like this:

E-1 to E-4 on Easy, E-5 in the Medium and E-6 in Easy

Well; Here my current Fleet situation:

Considering my current conditions, do you think I could make the event at least in Normal or even try risk in Hard?

if not:

I want to know in your opinions, what Kanmusu I should prioritize to level up and what equipments I should prioritize to get for this event to make it at least in Normal ou even Hard!



Thanks in advance
