[[File:Ss_(2016-08-20_at_01.48.02).png|right]]So I was in the middle of Kancolle when I got kicked off the game with some message (Google Translate says I need to relog in). Sure, okay, I try that. The problem is, every 4 seconds the DMM login page is up, the message to the right pops up saying I need to refresh the page because it's expired. I'm on Chrome and every time it pops back up I'm forced to refresh the page, and after that I can't click to log in or ANYTHING until this same dialogue box pops up again. I tried to click the "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs." box but it doesn't help at all.

I've tried opening up the DMM site using different URLs hoping I can reach the homepage or something, nope, I get directed right into the DMM login page. This is driving me insane. And this is what the page looks like while it's frozen and I'm unable to do anything.[[File:Ss_(2016-08-20_at_01.56.38).png|right]]<ac_metadata title="DMM logged me out and I can&#039;t get back in"> </ac_metadata>
