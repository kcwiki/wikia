I mean, currently I'm leveling: Shiratsuyu, Naganami and Yura (Passive leveling Murasame and Kinu via Exped) but I feel a little lost, especially with an event on the horizon. 

I have so little interest in Kaiboukans orz

Also, I guess, what difficulty should I go in the Event? I have 110k Ammo/Fuel, 150kSteel and my lowest Baux (86k). 712 buckets.
