So I know each extra drum increases GS for drum expeditions, but my question, since it wasn't specified in the wiki...is by how much? So for example I have an expedition that needs 8 drums, how many more do I need to add to reach the 40% cap? Thanks in advance ye generous admirals :3<ac_metadata title="Question on Drums and GS"> </ac_metadata>
