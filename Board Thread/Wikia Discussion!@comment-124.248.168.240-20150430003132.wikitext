Hello, I got something that a bit strange to me and hope someone can help me. Previously, I used VPN to get through DMM and just recently I tried to use region cookies instead, and the problem is that every time I access the site, its always direct me to the region restricted page that I can not go back to the general page at all (even I already clear the cookies many time already). I'm using a chrome based browser (360 browser), but it's seems ok if go with Chrome.

Just want to lift this strange thing off from my mind, hope you guys will help, thank you. <ac_metadata title="Try to go with region cookies but always being directed to it&#039;s region restricted site......" lastmove="1452416623"> </ac_metadata>
