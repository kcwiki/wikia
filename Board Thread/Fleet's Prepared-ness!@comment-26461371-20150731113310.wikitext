Alright, I guess it's about time I admit I'd need advice from the seasoned veterans regarding my fleet (and being the new rice I am, I should be).

HQ: 91.

Resources: 30k+/30k+/30k+/27k+ (yes, I'm ''trying'' to get my bauxite under control).

Buckets: 340+.

Shipgirls: [http://puu.sh/jk22g/c8ada5725e.png DDs] , [http://puu.sh/jk23Z/1eb4d3f549.png CLs/CLTs] ,[http://puu.sh/jk256/000ad6a8f2.png CAs/CAVs] , [http://puu.sh/jk26Q/c8e1dd6eb0.png (F)BBs/BBVs] ,[http://puu.sh/jk28u/3807686531.png CV(L)s] ,[http://puu.sh/jk2bC/897deb477b.png SS] .

Equipment: Two Reppuus, four Shiden Kai Nis, three Type-3 shells, two Type-91 APs, a Type 94 and a Type 91 AAFD; seven Ryuuseis, three Ryuusei Kais, one Suisei M12A, two Ju 87C Kais from the "on the way to Z1" quests, more than one Saiun (they just kept popping out!), Sendai Kai Ni's Night Battle Package.



and the questions:

* ''Is this enough for Easy?''

* ''How about Medium? ''

* ''Is there anything else I could do to be better prepared (aside from resource stockpiling)?''

(no, forget about Hard; not doing it for my first event, for now I just want to break myself in, or something.)

Thanks in advance for any advice!
