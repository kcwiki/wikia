I'm sorry if someone has already started a topic with a mechanic relating to mine, I'm new to the fourms here :)


So I was in bed one night and just suddenly though of this ingame mechanic, here is how it goes:

If you've watched the anime then you will know that Kaga of the 1st Carrier division and Zuikaku of the 5th Carrier division have a bit of a rocky relationship (In the end it seems they are on better terms). Then I though to myself, If they hate each other in the anime, why (in the game)  can they be placed in the same fleet, Why isn't there a debuff or penalty  for putting them in the same fleet. And that's where the Friends and Enemies mechanic comes in.



I though it would be a good idea (and it adds a bit more depth and thinking into your fleet building) to add this mechanic in. Say if your main fleet has Kaga and Zuikaku in it, They could cause a debuff that drains their morale and minuses the fleets total XP gain (the longer you don't resolve this conflict, the worse the debuff gets) 

There will also be bonuses and buffs (hence the "Friends" part)

For example you have Zuikaku and Shokaku in the same fleet, then their XP gain will increase and the fleets morale could increase together.

The buff/debuff doesn't always have to affect your game though. If you have a conflicting fleet then maybe during the sortie, some lines of dialoge are played by the conflicting ship girls (they could be arguing or disagreeing on something) and if you have a matching fleet then the dialoge could be them talking or telling jokes to each other (the dialoge will depend on what matching fleet girls you have)

If this mechanic proves to be a bit... overpowered then maybe the mechanic will unlock after your HQ reaches a certain level (I was thinking after your HQ level reaches 75+) or the devs can downgrade the harshness or rewards of having a "Matching Fleet"

I just wanted to get all of your opinions and thoughts on this mechanic and if this discussion gets large, maybe the devs themselves can think about it and possibly add it into the game. <ac_metadata title="&quot;Friends and Enemies&quot; - New Fleet Mechanic" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
