Hello everybody, i have a question here.... in a couple of days im gonna visit my family, they live far away from me... can i connect to the game from two diferent places without get banned? Â I mean, in some games, when you connect from two or more places (not at the same time), you can have your account suspended or banned due to illegal or suspicious activity... Do i have to run the same risk in this game or not?

Thank you all and have a nice day :)<ac_metadata title="Connection from two diferent places"> </ac_metadata>
