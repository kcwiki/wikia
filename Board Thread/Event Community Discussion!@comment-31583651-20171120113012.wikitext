At the moment, I am running LBAS and 2 support expeditions, as well as my very best ships instead of the map required ones; I find that taking the long route is still safer than taking my small girls through L. The problem is that I am currently looking at ~2k res consumption a sortie, and only have 11k to spare (Ammo and Fuel). Also, reaching the boss node is by no means consistent, though I am able to S rank it. I have been able to get to the boss 3 times in 7 sorties. The next problem is that I can only bring down the bar by 14 tp. This means that I need around another 28 sorties to complete the world.

In short, I'd be really happy if any of you could find a composition for me that:



Consumes less resources

Is more consistent at reaching and S ranking the boss node

Will bring more TP to the TP node



I have been thinking about sending LBAS to the Boss and L node, and taking a second CVL to compensate for AS on the air nodes.

All tips are welcome ^^

Please note: KC3 doesnt seem to show the 7th ship of the 3ird fleet, but that is Tone with 2x 203s 1 spotter plane and 1 searchlight[[File:A47df1d0-c30d-4b94-b440-254b5d133182.jpg|thumb]][[File:Knipsel.png|thumb]][[File:D99c84f4-9373-407e-a69f-ea7c65f1c1e6.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Help on E-2 TP runs"> </ac_metadata>
