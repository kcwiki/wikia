Senpai,



sorry if i miss information somewhere in this wiki.

as the title says, does ship condition/damage status affects her firing power?

i only can find the confirmation about accuracy and evasion.

how about firing power?

if there's not really any official confirmation, hope you can share your own opinion.

it'd really help me, thanks.<ac_metadata title="Does ship condition affects her firing power?"> </ac_metadata>
