Dear our lovely, adamant, magnificent and enthusiastic Kancolle Wikia community. As some of you may notice Wikia is currently acting weird again. To put in Lay-man's term it is "fucked to crisp". In other words, something is wrong and it's not our fault.Â 

Current noticeable problems are:

*[[Thread:437392|Voice files acting weird]]
*Tabbers not working properly (please don't blame any editors for now)
*I became a sexy 4.20 m (for Iowas: 13.7795 ft but that sounds stupid) melon.

Also
* Anon. IPs
* Back to top button
* Image tooltips
* Countdowns
* Drop list details

"ADDED GAKA's STUFFS"

Basically nothing from [[MediaWiki:Common.js]] (not the first time this happens anyway).

<span style="font-weight:normal;">Just keep calm, carry on and before you know it the problem will be fixed after they come back from their Subway break.</span> <ac_metadata title="[14/5/16] Current Problem with the Wikia - Tabbers, Voice files, etc."> </ac_metadata>
