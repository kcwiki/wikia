Hello Friends~ So right now i play arround 1 year with some breaks in between cause of RL.

Anyway i would like to hear your opinions and maybe some advice for what i should do before the event. And if you guys think im able to do it on Normal+

First things first: I sadly wasnt able to lvl Akitsumaru, Akitsushima or Akashi sadly.. But i hope ill be fine.

I have 4 Repair docks wich should help out a lot too. Anyway ill now put some Screenshots of my Fleet and of my Equipment please tell me what you think~ Thank you~
