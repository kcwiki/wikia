I've been playing for a while now.  My first event was the event where Akitsushima was the final reward (didn't make it to the end), and the second event was the event where Teruzuki was the final reward (stopped at the last map when I realized I would run out of bauxite before finishing).

I have historically had issues finishing events on Hard; most events I've been doing the last map on Easy.  My main issue involves not being able to effectively deal with very high-HP/Armor ships that are not the flagship (BB Himes in particular).  During the last event, I tried to do E-4 on Medium, but could not deal with BB Himes in Z6, and so I finished that event on Easy, and even then I barely got the final kill (took a closing torpedo doing only 20 or so damage).

Therefore, I would like to ask for some advice on improving my fleet and equipment for the next event.  I do have a few qualifiers:

1.  I would like to not use more than 100K in any resource, and use no more than 500 buckets.  This is based on how fast I can recover resources between events if I do work on a ship/equipment.

2.  I can only play the game for a couple hours a day on the weekdays (mostly doing dailies and PvPs).  I can play some more on the weekends, but that depends on many real-life factors.  I cannot play at work due to IT restrictions.

3.  I would like to finish the event in less than 5 days.  Kancolle is #3 on my priority list of hobbies.

As a reference, I did the last event going Medium->Medium->Medium->Easy, and the Ark Royal even doing Hard -> Hard -> Normal -> Easy -> Normal -> Easy -> Easy.[[File:Equipmentlist-aria.png|thumb]]

Thank you in advance for any advice you all can offer![[File:Shiplist-aria.png|thumb]]
