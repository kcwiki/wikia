I'll expose my theory about the upcoming Summer 2016 event. Im currently based on official tweets and historical events.



1 -Â It is possible (but certain for me) that the event is based on the Japanese MO operation which took place in April 1942 (Maybe on the Tulagi or Port Moresby invasion plan).

2 - Current information on officials tweets can show that US Carrier can be present in reward (Maybe the USS Yorktown who strike the Tulagi invasion force). - Or Aquila, thanks to Mytyl for is suggest).

3 - Possible drop for Kamikaze class destroyers. (Maybe in that case Oite or Hatakaze).

4 - I think we can have an US submarine (Maybe the USS S-42 who sunk Mikazuki after the invasion of Tulagi on the 10 may).

5 - During the operation 2 Mutsuki class was there (1 sunk the 10th and an another was damaged by Yorktown's aircrafts).

6 - If the Port Moresby battle was in, we can concluded that : The fresh new Tulagi air base was provided support to the main assault on Port Moresby.



PS: My theory is only based on historicals facts, Maybe the names/country of ships can be false)

And sorry for my bad english :3

Furthers informations can be added in the futur. thanks for reading this.<ac_metadata title="My Theory on the upcoming Summer 2016 Event."> </ac_metadata>
