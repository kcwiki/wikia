So i realised i'm in dire need of radars if i wanted to avoid missing 6 times in a row so i tried to develop some. I looked it up and i should have at least 10% chance of making one Â (with the right flagship) yet even after 20000 bauxite and steel i ended up with junk and 0 radars. Now i feel stupid and cheated for ever even believing those statistics... what a awsome game this is...<ac_metadata title="Statistic of development and construction"> </ac_metadata>
