Hi !

I'm a somewhat new TTK (I started to play in march) and I'm looking for some advice on my fleet composition and on stockpiling. I tried to complete the Spring event on easy, but I couldn't go beyond E-4 because I ran out of fuel and buckets while trying to farm some destroyers, and I felt like my fleet was really lacking as far as levels, equipment and size were concerned.

I'm aiming to complete the summer event by doing a mix of easy difficulty and medium difficulty (but mainly easy) because I probably don't have enough ships to deal with ship locking, thus making medium impossible. 




Here's what I have in my fleet at the moment :




'''Ships above level 25 '''(Most of them are also fully modernized, except for AA)''' :'''

'''DD :''' Samidare Kai (81), Kuroshio Kai (77), Nowaki Kai (68), Shiranui Kai (67), Makigumo Kai (67), Shigure Kai (44), Suzukaze Kai (42)

'''CVL :''' Houshou Kai (92), Jun'you Kai Ni (85), Hiyou Kai (34)

'''Current Ressources : '''

'''Fuel :''' 50K

'''Ammo :''' 73K

'''Steel :''' 80K

'''Bauxite :''' 42K

'''Buckets :''' 377




'''HQ lvl :''' 94




Right now my main worry about my fleet (considering that there isn't much time left before the event) is my lack of CV and CLT. I didn't have any CV or CLT during the Spring Event (except Akagi who was only lvl 20), so I tried to use 2 CVL instead of 4 CV, which led to a disaster for my buckets. I started to focus on leveling Kaga and Akagi when I learned that CV were going to be important again during this event, as well as Kiso to have at least one CLT. I've also red on the preparation guide that CAV are important for branching rules, but all my ships that may be remodeled to CAV (Kumano, Suzuya and Tone) are below lvl 10.




For the moment what I'm planning  to do is to level both Kaga and Akagi to at least lvl 60 (with PvP only to reduce the bauxite cost) and to craft at least one additional Reppu (while doing my dailies). However I also thought it might be a good idea to level one or two low lvl ship(s) to compensate for my current weaknesses. Is it a good idea, given how little time there's left before august, or should I only focus on stockpiling from now on (I'm a bit afraid of running out of fuel, bauxite or buckets) ? If it is a good idea, should I focus on leveling another CV (I currently have Katsuragi, Zuikaku and Souryuu, all below lvl 15), another CLT (I only have Ooi, at lvl 14), add a CAV to my fleet (Kumano, Suzuya or Tone) or something else entirely ?




I would welcome with open arms any piece of advice or criticism regarding my fleet and my equipment, or regarding what I was planning to do !
