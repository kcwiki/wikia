Just like the title said I'm looking for light novel(LN) to read.(preferably in english and/or already complete or have decent length that already translate.)

the first to catch my eyes are the kancolle LN.Is it any good?

second I'm looking for some LN to read. I'm not really picky about the genre but I like to read LN that have at least some '''comedy''' in them.
