Some time ago, an update made it so that some specific dive-bomber planes can hit installations, and that info was noted in this wiki. However, it is removed now as so far as I can find. Does anyone have the full list of dive-bomber planes that can allow carriers to hit installations? I only recall that the Proto Nanzan and the Suisei (Group 634/With Cluster Bombs) are part of them. In addition, can a modÂ update the combat guide, installation, and equipment pages with those planes? Thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="Anti-Installation Aircraft"> </ac_metadata>
