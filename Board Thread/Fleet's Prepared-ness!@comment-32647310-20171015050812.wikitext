In any event, I'm not really sure if my fleet is lacking anything other than getting ships to K2, more Blueprints for ships that need them (Shoukaku, Choukai, Chikuma and Amagi to be specific, as they are at the right level).

The same goes for equipment as well. At present, I am slowly working on getting my 2nd T2 Seaplane Fighter Kai and Ro.44 Seaplane Fighters (the Seaplane Fighter Kai is a LOT more expensive but not much better than the Ro.44), turning the M32 (Skilled) into a M52 (Skilled) and building a 2nd Max-Star Type 96 for Skilled Crewmember creation). While these things cost a lot of Screws, the Helper Ships are diverse enough that I can do a crafting every day and work towards one of these goals.

...so anyway, there you have it.<ac_metadata title="Roast My Fleet"> </ac_metadata>
