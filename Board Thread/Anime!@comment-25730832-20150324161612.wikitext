''[One of you need to change Episode 11 to Episode 12 in the front page since I can't do that. Thanks.] - Gensui updated it.''

This thread is for the discussion of Kancolle Anime Epoisode 12; "Enemy Planes Above, Dive-bombing!" or "敵機直上、急降下!"

Episode will be airing in tomorrow (March 26th) at (i think) 1:00 AM JST

You can vent whatever you want to your heart contents here but play nice with each other.

'''On other news'''; the next Anime season is coming up in a few weeks and guess what shows are making their return: ''Oregairu S2, Sidonia no Kishi and FATE UBW S2!'' (GDI Ufotable for pulling that S2 again!) ''Denpa Kyoshi and Yamada 7-nin'' are also starting their engines. Oh and there's also Gintama, Nisekoi and Nagato-ruhi but those are either like-it-or-hate-it-type.

'''Note''': Now this is where it is revealed that Kanmusus are souls that escaped from the sea in hope of returning to living a leisure life on land and Shinkaisen-kan are angels that wish to return Kanmusu back to the sea before they turn rogue.

All in all it's been a ride...not a fun one but it's a ride... I hope that if I ever need to do this again that it will be about Mutsuki-class...wait, maybe I asked too much...just read the script before doing it I guess?

If there's one thing I regret...it's not doing [[http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/ay0XZLM_700b.jpg this]] ever since episode one. GG Kusakawa I see that you kept some skills during your works with SHAFT (mainly the headtilt).<ac_metadata title="Kantai Collection Anime: Epoisode 12 Discussion" notify_everyone="1427213772"> </ac_metadata>
