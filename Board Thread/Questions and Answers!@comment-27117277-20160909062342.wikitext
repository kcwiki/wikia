[[File:SaLS.jpg|thumb]]Hello all

This happend about an hour ago where I'm just stuck at the loading page. ( Shockwave crash so here I am)

I can play other DMM games no problem. ( loaded and playable)

I use VPN connection primarly, haven't really touch or even try the API method before. 



Anyone have any ideas or suggestion to solve this ?

Thanks

Update #1: I try the API method, still same screen. 

Update #2 : I went ahead and create another dmm account and managed to get into Rabual Naval Base without any trouble. But i still can play using my old account.

Please help....<ac_metadata title="Stuck at the very beginning loading screen !?"> </ac_metadata>
