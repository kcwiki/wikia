still, i'd like to ask you guys if there is anything i can do now to at least have a bit higher chances of clearing this Event (like leveling some important ships, idk). 




Fall was my first Event and i didn't clear it, so i don't really expect clearing this,

anyways, thanks in advance for your advice,
