I just got the second jet, and I have no idea how i'm meant to use them properly. Do I treat them as fighter bombers and toss them on there when I need help with AA? Do I just always use them when I can? Or are there only a few special situations or setups I should use them with? Getting the second one through upgrading was a bit annoying, so I kinda want to use the jets as much as I can.<ac_metadata title="How do you properly use jets?"> </ac_metadata>
