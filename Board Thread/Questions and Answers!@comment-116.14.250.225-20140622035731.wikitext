I need to make sure that both DMM login and my email really just making fun of me:

Here the day after 20 Jun maintainance, the game suddenly prompt an error to my screen while I afk, since Im waiting for ships to repair before sortie so I went to reload the page. Rather thanÂ '''reload the page''', they put me in the login section and by using the same method to login, it fails to do so and I got a request to reset DMM password. Using the set and steps from the page, I sent the info to my email but turn out it receive nothing. My email doesnt contain alt account so I can say that the info cant be sent to anywhere else, and that email is confirmed I use as kancolle ID no doubt

So there is an anon admiral suggest I contact DMM for solution, but I need a jap translator for that(still cant perfect a sentence tho):

''*I need to check with my current email acc() on the problem with login error, this acc had been used since the start of the game but it actually stop receiving DMM news and stuff, until today the site need me to reset my login password I realise that my email no longer function to receive info from DMM. I need to retrieve the email as my main login ID. Note: In tries of different method to test what lies the problem, I had used the said email for new registration for testing out the ability to receive info from DMM, it seems to work fine as I receive the confirmation of registration and was able to change password. Please, if there is anyway to revert my email to the main ID, Im very grateful for your efficiency.''<ac_metadata title="Login problem..HELP!"> </ac_metadata>
