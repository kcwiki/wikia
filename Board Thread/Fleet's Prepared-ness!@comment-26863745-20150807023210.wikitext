This is my second event and I'm planning to do a mostly-medium run, and few easy maps should be fine if I decide that it's not worth it. I have ~360 buckets and 41/42/74/39k resources.

This is my fleet and equips (the lack of reppu is sad)

Will I be fine? What should I level next? Thank you very much.<ac_metadata title="Am I ready to tackle Medium?"> </ac_metadata>
