I've been playing for 2 - 3 months, this is my first event so I want to see if I'm prepared for easy.[[File:List_-_meongu.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Here are my ships and equipments:]]Â I'm currently kai-ing some more CA, but maybe not in time for the event, and I need to gather resource too (they tend to deplete fast near the end of the week when I finish the weekly quest.) Also try my luck in clearing 5-3 with sub daily.

Thanks in advance and goodluck to everyone!<ac_metadata title="Prepare for first event"> </ac_metadata>
