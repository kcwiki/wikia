'''Update''': currently, using visual editors ''may'' be ok. It is still a good idea to use source editor for pages that use advanced coding (for example, templates), such as event pages.

To anyone planning on editing the wikia, go to your preferences and change the preferred editor to source. Classic rich-text editor is bugged at the moment and using it would only ruin the page layout every time you click edit.

To get some assistance with how to use source editor, you may want to refer to [[Help:Classic_editor|this page]].

More technical information will be edited into this OP thread, so stay tuned.

Technical information:
* This issue mainly affects "public namespaces". Examples of these include (but are not limited to):
** [[Winter 2018 Event]]
** [[Events]]
** [[Quests]]
* You do not need to run the same test for your own comments, user page, talk page or even any page within [[Sandbox]]. The bug will be isolated to those areas and are not deemed as critical to anyone else except yourself. However, you will need to disable visual editors and  classic rich-text editors when editing public facing pages *especially* the ongoing (as of writing) [[Winter 2018 Event]].
