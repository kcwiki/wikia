* I have an akizuki tho i feel like having another AACI DD would be overkill. She's level 23 if that helps.

Upgraded Equips :

35.6 *9 x1, *7 x1, *5 x2

I also have 40 screws to use, so i'm open to suggestions on what equips i should use them on.  Cheers !        <ac_metadata title="Fleet Appraisal needed."> </ac_metadata>
