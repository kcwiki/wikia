Last event was a success for my fleet as they can clear it on at least normal difficulty on every maps. Now, it is ready for the next challenge of clearing as many maps on Hard difficulty as possible. However, I don't have good plan for. Apart from improve some equipments, crafting shells and radar, and LSC for Bismarck when resources reach regen. cap., what I have right now is to level Prinz and Hatsuzuki to lv. 70 and level battleships (Natato, Mutsu, Roma, Littorio, Yamato) to lv. of 90.Â

I also have one one blueprint in arsenal. Who should I give it to? Littorio, Choukai (whom I have to level her if I want to give), or save it for Bismarck (whom may or may not join my fleet and need training if she decided to join)<ac_metadata title="Fleet check for next voyage"> </ac_metadata>
