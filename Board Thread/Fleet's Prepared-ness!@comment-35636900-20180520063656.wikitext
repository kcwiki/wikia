[[File:Ship_List_2018-05-21.jpg|thumb]]I am trying to do the final quest in the 5th anniversary series as quickly as I can before it ends. I am, however, unable to progress past 2-4. Any advice on the fleet composition and level needed to pass 2-4 (and 2-5 as well) with the quest active (2 DD and 1 CL(T) needed in the fleet)?<ac_metadata title="5th Anniversary Quest help"> </ac_metadata>
