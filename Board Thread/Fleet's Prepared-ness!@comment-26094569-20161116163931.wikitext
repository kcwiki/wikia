I have done several events on easy and cleared them (with the exception of this past spring event). i was wondering if i should step it up to normal and give it a shot this time? i'm worried i don't have enough of the right ships for ship locking and the only equipment i am worried about not having is the fleet command center and any skilled lookouts. (i would post my fleet but i'm not sure how to post it in the fourms since i can't load an image.)<ac_metadata title="should i try normal?"> </ac_metadata>
