If you are getting a "Script error" with some of the ship/equipment pages, you may wish to try appending the words: 
  ?action=purge
To the end of the URL, for instance:
  http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Akizuki
Becomes:
  http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Akizuki?action=purge
You may also need to do this a few times to make the page show the images as well as the accompanying infobox that comes with the image.

This is a known issue amongst [[Kancolle Wiki:Staff|KC wikia staffers]] as the following transcript has been provided below (between [[User:がか|がか]] and [[User:Ckwng|Ckwng]]):

|user = Ckwng
|quote = yeah, I have no idea why that happens<br>
it's happening in Lua core<br>
in the error() built-in<br>
Hasn't happened before, so...<br>
not sure what to make of this.<br>
It's always the same place though<br>
You can see MWServer.lua here: https://github.com/Wikia/app/blob/dev/extensions/Scribunto/engines/LuaStandalone/MWServer.lua<br>
I've sent a bug report to Wikia staff

'''20<sup>th</sup> July 2016 Update''': It appears the pages that depends on it are broken. Apparently a workaround is to edit the page (in visual editor mode) and it ''may'' work.<ac_metadata title="Script errors on the likes of ShipInfoKai template/module amongst other templates/Scribunto modules that depends on Lua" notify_everyone="1468897891"> </ac_metadata>
