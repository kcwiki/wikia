Last event (Winter 2017), I had a horrible time trying to clear the Saiun transport phase in E-3 because I didnt have any submarines at a decent level to even think of using them. Yes, there was an easy way to level submarines on that map, but fear of not being able to clear the event itself like I did back in Fall 2016 had me rushing to clear the event. I want to get at least 6 submarines to a high level somewhat quickly so I won't have that problem again.

I'm not interested in Orel Cruising for resources, so I won't be getting those levels for my submarines. Is there a map where i could go one or two nodes in and get more experience per run or even a map where I could get the same amount of experience Orel would give me in less time? Or am I forced to resort to Orel as the only place that is reliable enough to level subs in?

It would take about 15 days of doing 2 battles with D-Ranks, not including flagship experience or MVP, to get my 6 submarines to level 80 from the level they are at right now. That is doing perfect 3 minute runs not counting anything that may take up other time including sleep. My 19 destroyers that I need to level on the other hand would take about 19 days straight on 4-3 to get to level 80. I do have other things I want to do...<ac_metadata title="Submarine leveling that actually won&#039;t take forever."> </ac_metadata>
