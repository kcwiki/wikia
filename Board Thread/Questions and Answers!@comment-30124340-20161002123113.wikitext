Hey. (<span style="font-size:14px;">I apologise in advance for my english</span>)

I'd like to buy 2k points for extra 20 ship places for girls, but I don't know how to safely do the charges to my acc.

I also would like to using (national) debit credit card or buy dmm prepaid card from "japan-codes.com".

How to do it without putting yourself in danger of losing/ban acc, card (etc.)?

PS. I read about disable VPN, how to do it?Â After disabling this will not be a problem with the Internet? (Link via Ethernet.)<ac_metadata title="How to safely purchase DMM points?"> </ac_metadata>
