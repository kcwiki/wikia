I'm not sure whether there's a place to check the KC forum's status. But currently the site is inaccessible for me and sites that check sites' status.

Don't wanna to post this as a comment and don't think this should be under news and announcement. So. I decided to post here. If there's a place to check for the KC forum's status, please tell me.<ac_metadata title="Status of kancolle.himeuta.net"> </ac_metadata>
