Anyone playing this? During this past event a bunch of large breasted girls caught my eye. Figured I'd give it some time for English speakers to get into it and see what's up, their wikia is uh... like most of the wikias I see for various games, so I wasn't able to get a good idea on how fun or interesting the game actually is. It looks like it might have potential but I don't know if I feel like trying to learn a game I can't read and with what seems to be a sparse English speaking community.<ac_metadata title="Brave Girl Ravens"> </ac_metadata>
