I've been using Electronic Observer to play for a while now (mostly because I'm only playing to rip game assets) but recently it hasn't been working. I start it up, sign in, wait for the startup screen but it never comes and I'm left with a black screen the entire time. Does anyone know how to fix this?<ac_metadata title="Having some problems with my game client"> </ac_metadata>
