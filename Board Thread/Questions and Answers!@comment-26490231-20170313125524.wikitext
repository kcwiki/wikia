I lost access to my desktop computer for about 3 months due to moving cities, so I've been playing on my Andriod device (Phone) instead.

Today I bought a new laptop and had it setup like I normally did with every new computer I get. This time when I boot up KC and did my settings...... I got really confused as I was met with a screen filled with blurry pixels.

My question to anyone that can help me is, Has this always been the case? or am I missing something here?

Can this be fixed so my game can look more crisp? I really don't remember KC on computer looking so.. dull.... It used to be much more sharper than this.

Can anyone help please? Thanks!
