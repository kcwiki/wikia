Not sure if this has been discussed before. If I remember correctly, there was a discussion (or maybe just a comment) about the marriage & sinking dialogues, but...

Do we keep the font for "the trivia of how the real ships met their end" (i.e. sunk, capsized, or scrapped, etc.) small? I had the expression that it wants to attain the goal of ''not spoiling'', for lack of a better term. Kinda the same reason like, but not as strict as, how Marriage and Sinking dialogues are spoiler'ed (or censored).

I have taken notice of this because some pages like [[Kongou]]'s and [[Mikazuki]]'s have their formatting for that trivia removed.

I think that isn't a solid, consistent formatting yet, but I thought maybe it could be now.

I personally prefer them small, so that one can still totally avoid reading the words pertaining to their end, despite maybe havong a glimpse of it. I dunno, it works on me. o.o<br/>
