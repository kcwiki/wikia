So i last played the game like 3 months and ago and recently decided to go back at it. But sadly they instead made me choose a server and i to my horror i had to choose a new username. :/ I think it had to do with me choosing another server but then again i have forgotten my previous server. Is there anyway to reverse my actions?<ac_metadata title="Lost my account progress"> </ac_metadata>
