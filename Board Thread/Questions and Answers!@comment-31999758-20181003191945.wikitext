First i wanna say that i love all my ship, i never risked to sunk anyone and i wanna keep them. The problem is that me, like maybe many other people cant affort to marry them all (damn , some people still got slot problem, marriage come later..). My first ship to marry is Iowa, out of love for her my choice was also based on use, stat and need. Now the question, suppose you love all your ship, and all of them wanna marry you, if you gotta chose ,at this point is what ship get the most benefit for event purpose. Soo, any list or serious advice on what ship are a must ? Suppose you will have to marry at most 6 ship, which one will you marry out of love but for performance?Â <ac_metadata title="Marriage"> </ac_metadata>
