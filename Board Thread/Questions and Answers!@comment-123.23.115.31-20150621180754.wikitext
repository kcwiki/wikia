Okay, I have played this game for almost 4 months and my HQ lv is 97. 

My problem is I still haven't got any LSC rare ship.

I started LSC when I was lv 87 (Because I was so stupid that I had thought I had to have Akashi to be able to use LSC =_=, but I still haven't got her anyway.)

I use my resources to train my shipgirls to Kai2 every week so I can only do LSC once a week.

After seeing many admirals got Yamato, Musashi and Taihou at level much lower than me, It some how despairs me :((( 

I heard that there is a big difference between Admiral lv 99 and lv100 in the Event. And having Yamato-class will help passing the Event map easier. 

So I want to ask for when to LSC? Should I save a lots of resources and burn them once or do it weekly? How much should I save?<ac_metadata title="A nood Admiral need some advices or encouragements..."> </ac_metadata>
