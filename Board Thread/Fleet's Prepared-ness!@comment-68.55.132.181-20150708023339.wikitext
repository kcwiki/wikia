Hello all! This is my second event--I did the first one on easy with a couple maps on medium. I'm wondering if I'm set for medium or hard. I think with my ships levels, medium seems pretty achievable, but I'm pretty clueless about hard. I'd appreciate any advice on what to work on, what gear to go for, or how much I should be aiming for in terms of resources. I've already started stockpiling resources, but obviously am willing to spend some resources to level up ships that need it.Â
