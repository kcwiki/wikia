Hi guys.

I don't know if this happens to you but whenever I go off Kancolle and do something like watch videos on Youtube I notice that Kancolle loses its insta-load ability and I essentially have to redownload the game the next time I log in.

The problem's been slowly gnawing at me. Is there a way you can increase the browser cache or something or something I can do that ensures Kancolle doesn't get overwritten by Youtube videos?<ac_metadata title="Cache inconveniences"> </ac_metadata>
