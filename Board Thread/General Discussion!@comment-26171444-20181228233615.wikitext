Has anyone worked out an effective method to quickly level ships in HTML5 the way we could back in the glory days of 3-2A yet?

I have so many low level ships in my fleet, and with every event my list of ships that I need to level grind just keeps getting higher and higher and I don't see any real way to effectively level them anymore. It's honestly really frustrating. Of course I've been doing PvP, but it's just way too slow. How have you guys been levelling your ships since the change? All the old guides are out of date now so I honestly have no idea what to do...<ac_metadata title="So how does levelling work now?"> </ac_metadata>
