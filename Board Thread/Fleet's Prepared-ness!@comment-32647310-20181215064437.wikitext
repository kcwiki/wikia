Pretty much what it says on the tin; I'm looking for a Medium-Clear, time permitting.

'''Resources'''<br />
Fuel - 165k<br />
Ammo - 127k<br />
Steel - 112k<br />
Bauxite - 145k<br />
Buckets - 540

'''Equipment Goals'''<br />
There is no particular order/priority other than what I can afford both in screws and modfood.<br /> 
- Upgrade what Carrier and LBAS aircraft<br />
Shiden M11 -> Shiden M21<br />
T1 Hayabusa MIIIA to +10<br />
Spitfire MKI -> Spitfire MKV<br />
M52C (601) to +10

- Prep Quint torp to +10 for Sextuple Torp quest<br />
Note - I still don't care for TCI as a general thing, but I'm tired of looking at that quest. And since I don't have anything better to do at the moment, I may as well raise up some Kitakamis and Oois for their Quints as I find them

- Upgrade Main Guns<br />
20.3cm (No.3)s to +10<br />
Proto 41cm Triples to +10<br />
Proto 35.6cm Triples to +10<br />

Note: I have, at present, 3 Blueprints that are ready to go, but I am still weighing a number of factors, and so unless I get some really strong compelling arguments to the contrary, I am going to wait until the event kicks off to decide who gets them.<ac_metadata title="Winter 2018 (2.0) San-Check"> </ac_metadata>
