I was looking up what is eating away my internet allowance at significant speed and I found that my browser constantly sends/receives from nocookie.net, which is an integral part of this website, Please check what is going on, because 1. it constantly saps people's data usage. 2. it is suspicious because whatever script that is causing it is running even after I close all wikia pages, It can only be stopped by closing the browser. Just what is it sending/receiving?!<ac_metadata title="Suspicious script from nocookie.net?"> </ac_metadata>
