[[File:Kc_help.png|thumb]]I dont know if this is the right section to post this but I would really appreciate some help.

After finishing the W´17 Event,it has come to my attention that I am at a boiling point on which girls should I keep and which girls should I dismiss(would rather not scrap,just modernization -no,they dont dissappear,they just go to another NB to serve another TTK.).

Notes:

Kongo married (125lvl).

BP Ships are a must keep (Abubear,Yamashiro).

Gonna Kai 2nd Akitsushima and then dismiss her(yes,I am greedy for the plane,she dropped out of nowhere on E3E Node J)

Mikuma will be dismissed after Kai(greedy again,that No.3 gun),I dont like potatoes,only Kumano and Suzuya.

Nagato and Mutsu are good but I dont really use them at all..

I know Mutsuki and Kisaragi can equip Daihatsu on K2 and have low appetite but are not so strong.

Kamikaze class are event only so I am keeping them plus their ASW is gorgeous.

After Kai upgrade dissmissing 2nd I-401(greed).

Kasumi is a big tsundere and has a sharp tongue but not like Akebono tho.(idk if I should keep her bcs she has a nice K2).

Fubuki is a potato and her K2 finger position are giving me the chills so I am planing to dismiss her.

Any suggestions are welcome! :)

PS: I know I am a bad TTK but that sparkling equipment is calling me.No offence potato lovers,but I just dont like having potato girls in my fleet(yea,Mogami is the sole exception,11 airplane slots,but I am planning dismissing her too.).I can´t buy anything and I won´t even tho I want to(scared for my life) and u just have to play the game win,nothing else.



GL on farming!(Imma catch u I-13..) <ac_metadata title="What to do with only 100 slots ( Cant keep them all.)?"> </ac_metadata>
