Hi,Â 

The last event is coming to an end so it's time for me to prepare for the next event in the Fall. So I need advice to be able to make the next event in Medium/Hard.

What Shipgirl do I need to blueprint? (I will blueprint Zuikaku but for the next? Yura? Choukai? Suzuya? Nagato ?)

How much DD, CL and CA I need to do Medium/Hard mode?
