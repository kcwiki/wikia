Started at around February-March, did Easy and 1 Medium during the Spring event and felt it wasn't enough.

Now I'm aiming for Hard, and I'm wondering if my fleet is enough. Probably not gonna be easy but still.

Resources(at the moment): 89k/60k/93k/33k, 528 buckets.

DDs : Hatsushimo(82), Yuudachi(75), Shigure(71), Fubuki(71), Murakumo(71), Ayanami(70), Yukikaze(68)

CL/Ts : KTKM(93), Ooi(85), Sendai(82), Kiso(75), Jintsuu(62, planning to level her up to 70), still leveling Naka and Abukuma.

CA/Vs : Maya(87), Tone(71), Myoukou(70), Suzuya(70), Haguro(67, planning to level her up to 70), Ashigara(65, same with Haguro), Kumano(60, same with the other two)

BBs : Haruna(98), Kongou(83), Fusou(83), Yamashiro(80), Kirishima(77), Hiei(75), Mutsu(62, planning for 65 or 70), Littorio(26 ayy, planning for 65 or 70).

CV/Ls : Hiryuu(83), Junyou(82), Souryuu(79), RJ(75), Zuikaku(73), Hiyou(72), Kaga(71), Chiyoda/Chitose(70), Akagi(70), Zuihou(64)

Assume all of them are kai2, no BP for Littorio, next BP for Abukuma.

Equipment-wise, still crafting. I'm sure as heck 4 reppuus won't cut in, have 8 shiden kai2s. 4 Type 91 AP and 4 Type 3 shells. Sonars, Depth Charges and Radars are pretty meh atm. Have Egusa/Tomonaga quest planes, 4 12As.

Sorry for the terribad format lol<ac_metadata title="Planning to do hard, thoughts?"> </ac_metadata>
