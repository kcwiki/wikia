Am I prepared or nah? I really have doubts lmao

In the DD section I also have Shimakaze (lvl 36), Amatsukaze (lvl 37) and Hatsuzuki (lvl 40), and in the CL section I also have Nagara (lvl 43). Right now, I'm grinding Mogami, Hyuuga, Amatsukaze, Shimakaze, Jintsuu and Hatsushimo.

After I'm done with those ships, I plan to train Nagato, Shoukaku and Akitsushima more.

My Kai Ni plans include Shigure, Ayanami, Hatsushimo, Jintsuu (I seriously can't be more obvious than this), Hiryuu, Haruna, Jun'you, Ryuujou and Ashigara.

But, the question is: Do I have to work on anything else or am I fine?
