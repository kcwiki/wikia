I have a few questions please help me

-besides modernization and remodeling, do ships gain stats through leveling or any other sources too? I'm asking this because my lv16 hatsushimo with no equipments has more firepower than my lv 21 yuudachi kai and hibiki kai who both have good equipments (ones with more firepower). I never even modernized hatsushimo.

-I know that the number next to the planes on carriers are the number of planes. but I noticed that these numbers often changes. what is the cause of this? I speculated that it could be because the planes are lost in battle and regained in resupply or repair. but I am not sure. because of this I also wonder when do the carriers consume bauxite.

-I am currently using the API link but I've heard that you sometimes have to refresh them. to refresh I just need to follow the initial method when we use VPN to obtain it right? also when are the times I need to refresh the API link?

-I recently need battleships. I use the common battleships recipes on wiki and sometimes even add some more resources than the recipe suggested. but why do I always end up with light and heavy cruisers? It could just be RNG but still...

thank you very much to anyone who helps :)<ac_metadata title="A few questions for the game"> </ac_metadata>
