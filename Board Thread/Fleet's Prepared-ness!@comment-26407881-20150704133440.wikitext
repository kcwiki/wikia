Hello fellow teitokus,

I would like some peer evaluation as to whether my current ships are ready to clear the upcoming Summer event in all Hard difficulty. My first and only event was the previous Spring event, which I cleared in Easy difficulty for all maps with only 3 days to spare. I'm not sure what to expect for Hard difficulty so I'd like others to tell me whether I should attempt it or not.

My fleet are as follows:

DD: Verniy (78), Yuudachi K2 (74), Shimakaze kai (67), Shigure K2 (64), Ushio K2 (61)

CL(T): Kiso K2 (95), Kitakami K2 (93), Jinstuu K2 (65), Sendai K2 (62), Naka K2 (48)

CA(V): Maya K2 (78), Nachi K2 (69), Choukai K2 (67), Kako K2 (65), Kumano kai (57), Suzuya kai (46)

BB: Haruna K2 (107), Kirishima K2 (76), Bismarck drei (76), Kongou & Hiei K2 (75), Fusou kai (67), Mutsu kai (62), Yamashiro kai (45), Musashi (36)

CV(L): Junyou K2 (89), Kaga kai (82), Soryuu K2 (80), Ryuujou K2 (75), Hiyou kai (74), Chiyoda kou K2 (72), Akagi kai (61), Chitose kou K2 (50), Shouhou kai (50)

SS: I-168 kai (75), Ro-500 (68), I-19 (62), I-58 (61)Â 

All tips and advices will be appreciated!<ac_metadata title="Hard Difficulty preparation: Aye or Nay?"> </ac_metadata>
