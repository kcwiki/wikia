Hello again my fellow TTK!

I've been inactive in the last couple of months (I missed all them juicy proto flight decks and all the other goodies...) so I'm here again asking for your elightnedness XD

The situation for ship and equip is as follows:

[[File:Ships_26-07-18.jpg|thumb|left|Kanmuso]][[File:Equip_26-07-18.jpg|thumb|Stuff that goes boom]]













The rsc are low, so it's my 1st priority.




I'm looking for an Easy run with some Hard or Med if the maps are feasible and the rewards worth it.




Any help is, as always, apreciated!<ac_metadata title="Easy Run for Summer18"> </ac_metadata>
