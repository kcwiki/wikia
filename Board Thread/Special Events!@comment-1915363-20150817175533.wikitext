As some of the data miners have already realized by now, the Abyssal ship parameters are no longer listed in the master data, which means fighting the bosses and new enemies themselves would be some of the only way to obtain any reliable information regarding them. I would like to request the data miners to help out and fill in the wiki entries for the new enemies we've fighting whereas possible.

According to [[User:Dragonjet|dragonjet]], the api_eParam and api_eSlot entry in "kcsapi/api_req_sortie/battle" has the basic information regarding the enemy. It doesn't reveal the whole thing though, certain info such as plane slots and soft stats aren't listed in there either.

Players whom wishes to help out can install [http://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler/fiddler2 Fiddler2] (more information about it can be found [[wikipedia:Fiddler_(software)|here]]), encounter the enemy with the software on and post the resulting API call with the description (which enemy) here. The wiki administrators/moderators as well as myself will fill in the wiki details from here.
Currently I'm doing E7 Easy, and would like to request assistance from players who are generous enough to spend some resources to replay the map at Medium and Hard.
