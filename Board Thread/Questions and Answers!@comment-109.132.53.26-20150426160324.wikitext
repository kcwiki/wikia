Hi all, i'm still a rather new admiral and despite alot of grinding (HQ lv 50 currently) I still can't clear world 3.2. My destroyers keep missing (or just dealing scratch damage) and keep getting one shotted despite having near full modernisation rank. I'm stuck at this place for 2-3 weeks, is this normal? I'm really starting to lose the fun in this game if this keeps up so i wonder if i'm doing something wrong?<ac_metadata title="Game difficulty"> </ac_metadata>
