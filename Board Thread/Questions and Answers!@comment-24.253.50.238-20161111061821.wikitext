I know this is a dumb question but I just want to be doubly sure that it's okay. So I've been playing BDO lately but I've been hesitant to run Kancolle viewer at the same time. I'm not cheating or anything but for some reason I thought that BDO's Anticheat my interfere or mess with the info sent to the dmm servers and like false flag me for cheating or something. I know dumb but I'm too paranoid to lose my kancolle account. So yea just wondering if it's A-okay. Thanks in advance!<ac_metadata title="Should I be concerned about a different games anti cheat running while I play Kancolle?"> </ac_metadata>
