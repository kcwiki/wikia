You guys all know who he is; some hate him, some love him. He might brought this upon himself, but this time...I'll salt a toast to you.

The saltiest person? In my opinion it's still [[User:Nanamin]]

Everyone probably know about the infamous E-7 already (for those who don't...you will). Some had the ballz, the time, the resources and special handjob from luck goddess to cleared E-7 Hard. On the opposite side, many went for easy instead (and some went Normal).

'''So I want to see what people in this wikia chooses. Just put the folowing below (I don't want to do poll because people can click Hard for the lulz).'''

-Difficulty

'''Additional info'''

-The number of runs made

-Bucket used

-Resources used

-The X/Y Node sinking thing (Just because...)

-Any Whining but keep it short



'''For the lulz'''

-The most saltiest moment of your E-7 runs.



Btw, if you're ranting your experiences of not clearing it yet but you manged to clear it later, put a sentence in '''bold '''that says '''I CLEARED IT! '''or the likes
