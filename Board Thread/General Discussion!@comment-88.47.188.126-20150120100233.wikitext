I have a sort of a problem, I started the game yesterday, did my first quests and got some first ships. When I tried logging later I start geting the cat message (network problem) through the api link. I tried connecting through the dmm but all I'm getting is a black screen with the ship (like the game is loading) and nothing happens. It doesn't matter if I connect through the cookie correction or vpn. Browser change also affects nothing. My country is Italy.

Is this a ban? But I got no messages at all either in mail or shown in game. Did someone encounter this before? Thanks for the answer.<ac_metadata title="Cat problem"> </ac_metadata>
