Hello!

I play KanColle since end of May 2015. Normally I shouldn't go any hard difficulties at this rate, but my friends say I should go hard with my HQ 99 lvl. Of course, last extra-operations should be Â impossible for me so I think about droping to medium at E-5 or E-6. Or maybe I should don't even begin with hard, what do you think?

There are also Shigure 61 lvl and Yukikaze 59 lvl that are missing in this list.

There are also Hyuga 60 lvl and Yamashiro 44 lvl[[File:V9vuY54.png|thumb|Shipgirls]][[File:Wkrgxto.png|thumb|Equipment]]<ac_metadata title="Should I begin with hard and end with medium?"> </ac_metadata>
