I put my fleet and equips into that imgur album.

(HQ level 96 atm)

[[File:Ss_(2015-07-22_at_11.39.56).jpg|left]]Here's my resource count - I'm currently spamming expeditions 2, 5, and 38 (weekly quest).

Not sure if I should be concentrated on stockpiling resources at this moment, or continuing to level certain ships.  I think given the time period to the event, I'd be able to maybe get a ship to kai ni regardless of their starting level at this point.  There's some ships not listed in that album, but I do have all the important ships that have kai ni and such, but i don't know if you think there's a need for one of those to be grinded up (given resources).

I've cleared the past event on easy, and I wanted to maybe try for medium/hard this event, but I'm not sure as this is a large scale event.  I'm guessing that I'm going to need to do some heavy equipment development (particularly planes, and AP shells probably), but I'd also like some advice on that too
