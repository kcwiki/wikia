Did Wikia itself changed something in the audio .ogg formatting that plays the lines? Normally, when you click the "Play" button, the icon would change to a down "V" position and it'd play whichever line without leaving the page. Now, when I click Play, it takes me to the .ogg file itself and then play it.<ac_metadata title="Audio clips odd behavior?"> </ac_metadata>
