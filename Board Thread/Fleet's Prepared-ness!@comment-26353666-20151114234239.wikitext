My second event. On the last event, I only finished at E6, and it was "easy diff all the way". And now, I'm planning to clear the next fall event on Medium.

Here's my condition...
* My HQ level now is 99.
* My current resources: 650 buckets; 42k fuel; 40k ammo; 127k steel; 27k baux.
* Those are screenshots about my ships and equips.

Some of ship are using equips, so the stat is not on the default condition. Please give me your opinion. :)

* Ships:
