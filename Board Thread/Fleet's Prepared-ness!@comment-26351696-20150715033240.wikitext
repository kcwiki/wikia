I started playing this game just before the previous event. However, I was very new at the time, my ships couldn't clear E-1. Since I haven't played much during the past two months, here is what I have got.

<p style="widows:1;">Equipments: 2xRyusei Kai, 1xType 3 Sonar, 1xSaiun, 1xType 22 Surface Radar, 2xType 3 Shell, 2xType 91 AP Shell</p>

<p style="widows:1;">I'm trying craft Reppuu at the moment but Akagi keep saying "never heard about it" so I haven't got any yet. As the event is closing in what should I do now to maximize the chance of clearing easy mode (or at least E-1 lol) </p><ac_metadata title="Ready for Easy?"> </ac_metadata>
