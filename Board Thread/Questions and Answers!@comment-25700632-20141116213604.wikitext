Been doing alot of 1-5 grinding for my two alternate teams of DD's and CL's since 2-4-1 is still wrecking them and since I heard it was a good idea from a friend, but I'm being matched against admirals that are at least 15 levels or higher than me in PVP. I was just wondering if me grinding 1-5 for the past 2-3 days is the reason?Â <ac_metadata title="Being matched up against higher level admirals in PVP."> </ac_metadata>
