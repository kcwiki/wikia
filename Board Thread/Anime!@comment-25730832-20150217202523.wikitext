This thread is for the discussion of Kancolle Anime Episode 7; "I Hate CarDiv1!''" or  "''一航戦なんて、 大ッッキライ"！... whatever the translation is...

Episode will be airing tomorrow ('''Feb 19th''') at (i think) 1:00 AM JST.

You can vent whatever you want to your heart contents here but play nice with each other.

'''Note:'''

I bet my cheesecake that this is a Zuikaga episode. I do want to see where they will throw those two into. After the previous episode, I can't trust the title anymore (not to mention it kinda dropped my expectation down a bit). Zuikaga EP can also be a pretty good foreshadowing to a certain grand battle against the abyssal fleet where many types of flags will be raised.

My other bet is on Fubakagi episode + flags but really...that sounds a bit too far-fetch.

P.S.: Someone please animate [http://imgur.com/a/ELweD Level 1 Zuikaku]!! and [http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1930265?pool_id=9435 Hoppokaku!] <ac_metadata title="Kantai Collection Anime: Episode 7 Discussion"> </ac_metadata>
