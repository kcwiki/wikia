Hi everyone, I would like if you could give me some advice on what I should focus more to be able to clear the event in hard(last maps probably medium if resources are low)

Here some pics of my fleet:

<span style="font-weight:normal;">I plan on getting to 700 buckets and then hoard resources until the event starts, (70-80k(ammo, fuel) is what I expect I can get, can be more or less)</span>



<span style="font-weight:normal;">Well, whatever you can contribute to help improve is welcome.</span>
