Shortly before the summer event is over, the last carriers to use (Kaga, Taihou, Shoukaku KAI, KAI and Ryuujou Jun'you KAI) lost very many aircraft capacity. One problem remained to improve Taihou upgraded in KAI [when the event finish she had lv 34], but others continue with low capacity. Someone could explain me clearly? [I can not use Shoukaku - capacity: 0-0-0-0 ;_; ]<ac_metadata title="Someone can explain to me if you please? ^^"> </ac_metadata>
