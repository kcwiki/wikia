Layin in bed trying to go to sleep, browsing NHK documentaries when I see one about Comiket. Turns out it was C87 so it's not that old, winter 14 I think... not even 30 seconds into it, Nagato, the first girl, the best girl... then more girls, and more.. as it turns out the show doesn't really go more than 5 minutes without spotting some shipgirls. Figure someone here will enjoy it.Â
