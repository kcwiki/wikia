I am level 6 and have 3 CH (haguro, Choukai, Takao), 4 CL, loads of DDs and no BB/CV/CVL.

currently at 1-4, most of my main ships are above level 5, CHs are all over level 7

don't know what to do next, level up ships to get "kai"? get more ships? try to get a good BB? keep farming till HQ lv.20 and get equipments to complete 1-5 ASW?<ac_metadata title="guide/advice for noobs"> </ac_metadata>
