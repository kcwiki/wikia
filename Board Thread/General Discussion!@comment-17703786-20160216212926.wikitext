Apparently, according to [http://psnprofiles.com/trophies/4355-%E3%80%8C%E8%89%A6%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E6%94%B9%E3%80%8D this], which is a listing of all of the trophies available on PSN for the Kancolle Kai version. The name itself is written in katakana, but should be this one:

'''アイオワ

アイオワ級戦艦一番艦「アイオワ」が艦隊合流！'''

Her name doesn't appear to be listed as "USS Iowa" though, but instead just "Iowa". <ac_metadata title="Upcoming US Ship is USS Iowa" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
