I have remodelled Abukuma, Tone, Chikuma, Choukai, Zuikaku and Shoukaku to their respective Kai Ni. I have two blueprints and I'm wondering who should I remodel next? Candidates are Fusou, Yamashiro, Unryuu, Roma and Taigei all ready to be remodelled. The thing is my Nagato and Mutsu are level 92 and 90 respectively and my Kongou Class are all level 95+. <span style="font-weight:normal;">Sadly, I dont have Bismarck, Amagi and Littorio.</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> Should I just craft for Bismarck and remodel her or do the Scamp Quest first?</span><ac_metadata title="Blueprint Usage"> </ac_metadata>
