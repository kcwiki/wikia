So I just found out the Rinkichou trivia I added to Asashio's page just got deleted, so did the Japanese-Taiwanese source dispute about Tsushima's fate and final role, and let's just say having your hard work reverted by the click of a finger isn't necessarily the most enjoyable thing on earth.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can imagine that these are probably not important to some, but hey, this is the trivia section. If the most serious shipbuilding scandal in the whole history of the IJN aren't important enough even just to be part of "trivia", I don't think I'm sure what is important enough instead. (The "I am Aoba" trivia I added to Aoba's page survived, though)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should ask the opinions of the moderators here before adding more? I've been thinking about adding, say, Intrepid's nickname in the Japanese players' community (and some other "what-I-think-are-trivia" stuff) for a long time, but after all this I'm not sure if I should do that anymore.<br/>
Edit: I just checked some more pages and the scale of this so-called "cleanup" is beyond what I first thought. There are descriptions about the ships' fate and wreck information being deleted, which are very, very basic elements of trivia.<br/>
Seriously, I have to ask: just what are the mods' plan for trivia sections? Are you guys planning on keeping it at all?<ac_metadata title="What is &quot;trivia&quot; and what isn&#039;t"> </ac_metadata>
