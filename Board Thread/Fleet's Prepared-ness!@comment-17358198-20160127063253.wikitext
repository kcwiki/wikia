I have only been playing kancolle for the last month. Recently my friend gave me his old account and since my first acc have litterally nothing i decide to switch. Due to my friend have been afk for like 3-4 months so the resources and consumables are fairly low compare to medium-hard requirement. Also I dont know which ship need to be leveled up for the event.[[File:Eventasdsadasd.png|right]]<ac_metadata title="Newbie first event need help"> </ac_metadata>
