From what I can remember, around the time my subs reached level 95 (shortly after I finished E7 in summer event), they are getting rekt way more often, like taiha at first node in Orel. Before that, it may happen too, but only once per month on average. But after the event clear, it has happened frequently enough to make me wonder if I should use echelon formation.

Does it happen to other TTKs or just me?<ac_metadata title="What is happening to my high level subs?"> </ac_metadata>
