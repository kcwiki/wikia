Hi everyone.  This will be the last time I'll be asking for advice since I should be probably experienced enough to really start giving more advice rather than receiving it.  Just general thoughts about my fleet are appreciated.  I do plan on attempting hard for the whole event although the thought of 7 maps scares me a bit because I started stockpiling resources a bit late because I was busy with life.  

Just like last event I plan to spend a good day or so distributing my ships across all maps so I wouldn't be locked out.  Because I didn't and still don't have a large number of CAs and CVLs mainly I did have to fall back and use my even lower leveled ones and struggle on a few maps last time.  

So what are your thoughts?  I don't really plan on stressing out too much for the last few days since it'll be a stressful 2 weeks after that although I do have a few priorities one being Chikuma to 70.
