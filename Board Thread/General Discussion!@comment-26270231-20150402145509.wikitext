Got tired of the bugged wikia thing where IP users have delayed forum comments, so decided to make an account.

Same person as the op of [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:215495 First Six Ships] post, so if anyone knows how to claim ip contributions, that'd be coo.

Anyways, aside from the introduction,

We all love our kanmusu, but if we were limited to one fleet, what would that fleet be?

IGNORE GAME MECHANICS (branching rules, combined fleet, etc...), this could be your favorite team and/or your favorite individuals. You do not have to have all the ships in your actual fleet and you can still idealize a dream fleet, but sometimes these late comers fall out of your narrative (coming from an rp player here).
