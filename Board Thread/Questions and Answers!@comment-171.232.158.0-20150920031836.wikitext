Base on the above chart, 38cm kai is the best gun since it only have 1 FP less than Prototype 35.6cm but with total +8 Acc when equip to FBB and it can be upgrade to 10* with Akashi Arsenal.

I failed so hard on the previous event so i am trying to get back to my feet in prepare for next event.<ac_metadata title="35.6cm vs prototype 35.6cm vs 38cm kai for FBB in general ?"> </ac_metadata>
