so i'm a beginner in kancolle and i'm looking to participate in the upcoming event.

i've done some research on what to expect from the event. I know i'm not going to clear all 7 maps in the event , but i think with this i could do 3 maps ( correct me if i'm wrong)  but i want to do my best in this event and first of all i have to have a good fleet huh. 

i've done some leveling to have  a bit of every ships type and especially kitakami because many say she is the highest priority to have kai ni. 

Now what i would like to know is what ships i should definitly level more , since you guys have more experience in events probably, you know what ships are useually good in most situations ( or this event in paticular ). i'm also a bit afraid of my resources , i have an urge to keep my fuel above 40K, but would 30K be also good ? so that i can use 10K fuel to level my ships , or should i stick with this and get more resources without anymore leveling perhaps ? so in short for what should i focus on doing to get the most out of the event ?

these are my ship/equipment list with my resources on the ship list ( i hope its easy enough to read for you ^_^ )
