[[File:Equipment_List_2017-11-12_(1).jpg|thumb]][[File:Ship_List_2017-11-12.jpg|thumb]]Hi. I'm a newbie to the game, and was wondering what I should do to prepare for the upcoming event. I'm HQ lvl 31.

I suppose I won't be atempting anything other than Easy at this point. My resources are extremely low, and I don't think my fleet's up to scratch. What can I do to help gain more resources? I've been trying hard to get Hiei as my last Kongou-class in order to get my 4th fleet and go on more expeditions, but I've had terrible luck and spent a hell of a lot of metal trying to get her (and still haven't gotten her).



My resources at this point in time:

24 buckets

35 Devmats

~5000 fuel

~7500 ammo

~6000 bauxite

Less than 1000 metal



At this moment in time, I'm currently grinding 5 out of the 7 main hinted ships for the event (Fusou, Yamashiro, Shigure, Mogami and Michishio - I don't have the other two.) as well as Haruna, who's my highest level ship at the moment. Is this what I should be doing? Should I also be grinding the ships that I have from the Shima fleet?



Lastly, what equipment should I aim for? What should I use on my fleet?Â 



Is there anything else I should watch out for?<ac_metadata title="[Easy] First ever event - What should I do?"> </ac_metadata>
