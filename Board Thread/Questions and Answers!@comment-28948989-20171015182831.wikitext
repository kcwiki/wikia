Keep getting ingame errors such as 
[api_req_mission/result] failed to communicate with the server. This was most likely a connectivity error and is unrelated to your API link.

[api_get_member/preset_deck] failed to communicate with the server.

[api_req_kousyou/getship] failed to communicate with the server.

Never really had catbombing problems until this cursed week. My internet works fine, I tried cleaning the whole thing yesterday, cache and stuff to see if that was the problem but nothing changed.
My friend has the same problem I have too, we both started having these connectivity problems around last week.

I have noticed that, since I usually watch youtube on firefox while I play kancolle on chrome, everytime I get catbombed the videos I'm watching stop for a second and then resume. Also Kancolle seems to be wat more laggy when I start it then usual for the first minute or so (I never had problems running it).

Problem is, there's nothing really different on my part that could have changed my game, I've pretty much been doing the same stuff I have been for the last 3 years. Any ideas? I doubt me and my friend being the only ones having this problem.<ac_metadata title="Nonstop Catbombing since last week"> </ac_metadata>
