Hai guys~ I've read a few posts that other people have posted up and found out that I might be seriously lacking a few ships types, ship levels and/or Equipments.. ><

So I humbly ask for any advice that people can give me, (the more, the better~ Keep them cu.. coming* please~)

I would like people to rate and see if it's possible for me to clear Medium difficulty (or even hard if I can, tho I doubt it. =P) if not, then just securing Easy difficulty will be fine for me too~ =)



[ '''HQ''': 89 ] [ '''Buckets''': 459 ] [ '''Dev Mats''': 466 ]

[ '''Fuel''': 45k ] [ '''Ammo''': 36k ] [ '''Steel''': 34k ] [ '''Baux''': 27k ]

Will continue to gather resources like Crayfish......I mean Crazy* ( I'm looking at you bauxite..... (ーー゛) )



'''Ships''': For the sake of simplicity, I'll be namming ships that are '''level 25+ '''unless they are ship types that don't have many in them.... Like SS~ .......... and Chitose and Chiyoda... (I'm sorry I left you both at 12...)

'''DD''': [Верный 72] [Yuudachi K2 63] [Shigure K 52] [Hamakaze K 47] [Fubuki K 45] [Kagero K 34] [Shiranui K 34] [Murasame K 29] [Hatsuharu K 29] [Kasumi K 28] [Inazuma K 27] [Mutsiki K 27] [Kisaragi K 27] [Hatsushimo K 26]

'''CL''': [Jintsuu K2 66] [Sendai K2 62] [Kiso K 37] [Kuma K 35] [Tenryuu K 32] [Tatsuta K 27] [Naka K 25]

'''CLT''': [Kitakami K 49] [Ooi K 30] (KTKM is 49 at the time of the post, but should be K2 in about an hours time)

'''CA''': [Furutaka K 52] [Tone K 49] [Chikuma K 48] [Atago K 31] [Maya K 25] [Nachi K 25]

'''CAV''': [Mogami 27]                                     * Sah Empty~  (TT▽TT) *

'''CVL''': [Junyou 44] (I have other CVLs, but just didn't really bother leveling them..)

'''CV''': [Kaga K 65] [Akagi K 61] [Zuikaku K 37] [Souryuu K 34] [Hiryuu K 30]

'''(F)BB(V)''': [Haruna K2 116] '''( '''There's all my levels~! ノ(°∀°ノ) ''') '''[Hiei K2 76] [Kongou K 70] [Kirishima K 50] [Yamashiro K 49] [Mutsu K 42] [Fusou K 29] (Ise and Hyuuga both crying in the corner at 14.. Sorry! >< )

'''SS''': ...................................... [ I-168 18] [I-8 19] [I-58 2] [Maruyu 4] (God this is embarassing..)

I have a Blueprint ready for Tone the moment she gets to K2 so that might (?) make my CAV list look better. I also realise my CVL and SS are terrible.. but I don't know why, I just never touched them, Junyou's been like that ever since I got Akagi soooo...... Sorry Junyou. xP

If possible, please imform me about which ships I should prioritise leveling, as well as the map and fleet combinations~ Thankies~ =D

I also have Akashi and 20 Improvment Mats, So I'm able to upgrade some equips or aquire better equips.
