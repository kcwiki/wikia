Im sure almost everyone has this issue :

1. After Yasen, boss taiha, not sink <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:14px;">{{Salt}}</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:14px;">2. After Yasen, all but 1 destroyer standing laughing in your face, rejecting your S rank drops</span>



<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:14px;">So I was thinking and hope that this becomes true : The daylight battle</span>

As in literally fighting till the morning, making a 3rd battle phase.

Ships capable of attacking Conditions :

1. Morale > 50 (other words, no repair bucket, sortie, repeat)

2. Hayasui must be in the fleet (carrying supplies)

3. Those that carries supplement items ( dmgcon ) ( As long you have that, you skip yasen but engage in morning even if Taiha)

4. Combined Fleets only



However, this is abit op if left as is, so here are some drawbacks :

1. Hayasui MUST be in main fleet (theoretically, while escort engage, main fleet resupply) 

2. Main fleet FS MUST be a married ship

3. Daylight can only be participated by MAIN fleet (too bad escorts who went yasen)

4. Dmg scales on morning battle [if i rmb correctly, yasen is (FP+Torp)*3 ?] 

5. <span style="font-weight:normal;">After Daylight, all ships' morale drop to 0 , bucket can recover to 40 but during the period from 40-49 , cannot use irako/mamiya</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">6. After sortie ends, all ships' fuel, ammo, remaining planes/2* are lost</span>

*remaining planes lost doesn't affect proficiency.
