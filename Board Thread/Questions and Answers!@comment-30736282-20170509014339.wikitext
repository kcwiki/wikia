Before any of you start shouting kuso teitoku hear me out. I've been in agony over my constantly full inventory even though I barely have any BB. This is mainly because of my hoarding nature where I heart lock one of absolutely every ship. The problem is I end up having a full inventory of DDs I never even use (I already have my fav DD squad). My questions are:

1. Which ship isn't worth keeping at any time? (a.k.a. goes straight to remodeling)

2. Which ship should be kept for Kai equipment only?

3. Which ship should only be kept in late game only? (I'm only HQ 23)

4. Which ship should have duplicates? I know Chitose and Chiyoda are mandatory since I don't know any other more accessible Seaplane Tender<ac_metadata title="Ships Not Worth Keeping"> </ac_metadata>
