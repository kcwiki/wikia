Issue for ex. is when I get a new ship drop and it takes me to the reward screen but, shows everything besides the image of the ship itself. Even does it when I'm picking out ships for modernization and my fleets. Though with the menus it just takes them a second to load. The "Got ship" reward screen though never loads up no matter how long I wait.[[File:Theproblem.png|thumb|left|250px]][[File:18859476.png|thumb|left|250px]]<ac_metadata title="Problem with ship images."> </ac_metadata>
