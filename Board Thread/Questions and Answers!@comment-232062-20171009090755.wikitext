Been thinking about KC quite a bit lately so I decided to get back in the saddle and have teenage girls beaten on my behalf. Of course I'll go through the recent updates page to figure out what I've missed, but I was wondering if anyone could give me the gist of what's going on in KC these days. All I remember from the last time I played was clearing whatever event gave I-13/14 and then some time later I randomly logged in to K2 my Nagato.
