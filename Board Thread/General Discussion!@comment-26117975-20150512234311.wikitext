i have some question and this is the story goes[[File:Screenshot_(93).png|thumb]]

Last night, After i'm finish fill in this page(credit card register page) and go to the next page (reconfirm page i guess) For some reason (private reason), i choose not to register my credit card yet and press a "back" button and "reload" the page so the page back to before i fill in. But after some minutes past, i got announcement from my credit card bank if it's cut 10,00 yen from my credit card. After that i'm check to "credit card register page but it's still blank / empty like before i'm fill in. My question isÂ :

1. Why it's happening??since i'm choose not to register my card yet it should not cut my credit card..

2. Is DMM receive master card too??or just visa card only??
