[[File:Wikia forum broken - game updates board image.png|thumb]]
Wikia's hackish forums failed to work! Proposing to use the format of:
* [[Partials/Updates/2016_July_15th/Content]] (for the likes of [[Recent Updates]]
* [[Partials/Updates/2016_July_15th]] (for full debriefing, which already includes the information as laid out above but with extra fluff like developer tweets, etc)
from now on, thoughts?

<poll>
Go use the new format?
Yes, let's go with this format
No, you suck. I have a better idea (Please state your suggestions and proposals with screenshots in order to convey a clearer meaning).
Other, I don't care or whatever.

Pros of going with a page instead of forum thread:
* Everyone can edit page updates and not just moderators for instance.
* Each changes can also be "well documented" by having edit comment being made (visible).

Cons of going with page instead of forum thread:
* Page cannot be a notification to all (predominantly kc) wikia registered accounts. A simple workaround is to create a "dummy thread" advising readers to check the Partials page.
* All the little "niceties" that comes with forum threads such as the thread being automatically categorised as such is lost in favour of manual category inclusion for the page itself.

For a very long time, well before I became a KC wikia staff it was somewhat a standard to have both [[Recent Updates]] and the individual forum threads for each and every game update. Since then I have more or less adopted that similar standard except became more heavily focused on forum threads for game updates as [[Recent Updates]] will become crowded if every update contains very detailed information.

Since then, it was starting to slowly become apparent that the wikia's forum functionality not only lacks certain features (such as the ability to have a thread post/reply via search function be working as intended) but also the fact that forums has a few other issues such as (but are not limited to):
* The lack of "transparency" with the forum thread contents being the fact that it specifically only allows the thread creator as well as the moderators and above the ability to edit threads at will.
** The information which can be slow to be featured notably because of the flow on effect with the former point.
* Respond very slow as opposed to loading/browsing a standard wiki page.
* Tendency to time out when one tries to browse through a list of forum threads from a specific board.
* The now most recent case involving both huge as well as fancy content results in the information not being made visible but only by preview which requires workarounds.

The other problem was that a similar (if not identical) set of information about the contents on the update was to be also featured in [[Recent Updates]], it required double handling and that [[Recent Updates]] does not require the extra "fluff" such as:
* Developer tweets, nobody really ever reads that when the content itself is already very detailed.
* The timers for which is/was mainly used around maintenance window and that they only serve as archival/information purposes.
* Other subsections such as "External links" or "Misc. notes", etc.
It was around 2016 was when [[User:Qunow|Qunow]] proposed the idea to use a template that is to be shared with both the [[Recent Updates]] as well as the respective forum thread. Again, there were issues with this such as (and again are not limited to):
* It heavily relies on the [http://kancolle.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&prefix=&namespace=10 Template "namespace"]
* It giving off wrong perceptions when instead for instance creating a simple page would have been better off.

The fact that wikia's forum functionality was said to be as a hack does somewhat makes sense as with the few issues already highlighted in the second paragraph (from above). The fact that now this issue involving the "blanking" of forum thread content also exist has brought the issue to a head. Since then, the proposals by [[User:がか|がか]] seems to have solved a few issues compared to the idea with the templates as aforementioned however, there are still other issues which still owes on workarounds.

If you read up to this far, kudos to you and here is a little bonus for reading up to this far. What does the future lie for this proposal? well, it is never really something that one should vote on as short term solutions needs to be implemented as well as long term solutions needs to be ratified before the situation going out of hand. In the short run, I will be linking up the more recent game updates on [[Recent Updates]] to the old (and now deprecated) template pages. In the long run, these templates and possibly some other older forum threads discussing about game maintenance and such will be moved into the format [[User:がか|がか]] suggests as there isn't much of an ideal solution into fixing the limitations within a hack (created by wikia). The proposed short term solution will be implemented without significant delays however the long term solution I may wait out for opinions before implementation.

Gradually, as more and more things that wikia forums cannot handle such as the likes of:
* Ranking rewards
* Live/android updates
* Event announcements and news/updates
These will also be moved into Partial "areas" as required. Any issues that one encounters by then will be more or less decided on the spot.
