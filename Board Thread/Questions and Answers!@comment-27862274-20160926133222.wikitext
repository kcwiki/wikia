Welllllll, yeah, my resources are kinda dying at the moment lol. I really really really need some advice to recuperate my resources back for a hard clear. I am a disgrace of a teitoku lmao - a HQ 101 with like 4 digit resources ;___; i actually cri evertim. Would appreciate some help thanks!!! ^^  I lsc'd a couple times for taihou heheheh.... :( 

'''Pvp''' - I lose around 120 fuel and 160 ammo in pvp against each heavy pvp fleet, so basically i lose a tonne of resources. I would consider running a lighter fleet, but when literally every fleet is full of married bbs and cv(b)'s im kinda forced to fight with full force (don't want to divert my exp to ss)

'''Levelling''' - I lose 200 ish fuel and ammo for 2-3 nodes of 4-3. Drained maybe around 4-5k of ammo and fuel getting Satsuki from 0 to level 57 in 2 days. It's expected, so not too much to complain here. 

'''Expeditions''' - I run expeditions 6, 21 and 37 in the day right now with a majority of focus on bauxite and ammo. 

Overnight i run exp 24, 21 and 37 - Currently trying to use overnight expeditions that are around 7 hours.

'''Extra pic:''' Fleet 1 is my current kill everything pvp fleet and rest are my expedition ships (24, 21 and 37 respectively). Kirishima has an ap shell, but i unlocked her ap shell for improving my other +9 ap, so she doesn't have it here. [[File:Delete_this_as_well_2.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Expedition/Resource Management halp :|"> </ac_metadata>
