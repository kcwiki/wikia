[[File:Avadanship.jpg|thumb]][[File:Avadanequip.jpg|thumb]][[File:Avadanres.jpg|thumb]]Thanks for taking the time to look at this I appreciate it, this is my first event (started late September). I have a general idea of what is needed and I know my fleet/equipment is lacking but since I can't accomplish it all in time I need help in what to prioritize.

Right now the plan is at least Hiei, Souryuu, Myoukou, Haruna to Kai Ni.

I don't have Akashi, I will have 1 BP by the event (possibly 2 if I commit resources or get a medal during event) 

My goal is to accomplish as much as I can during the event espcially getting exclusive ships. Any advice on this in general is most welcome. I'm not sure what to do with resource management, I was planning on pooling up to softcap a few days before the event.

I believe that's everything. Thanks again!<ac_metadata title="In need of advice for fall event"> </ac_metadata>
