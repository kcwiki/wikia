Reserving this thread name for developing faction-based gameplay.
<!--
Japan: Same as Kancolle, with extra perks
<br>+ Excellent in first-strike capacity.
<br>+ Aircraft Proficiency max rank is one rank higher than all other navies.
<br>+ Outstanding torpedo capacity (even Akizuki-class was no slouch with it)
<br>+ Can equip naval armaments in supplementary slots (reduces morale cap)
<br>- Aircraft Proficiency resets when plane slot is 0 (which is very bad thing with Zeroes and cigar bombers)
<br>- Low-quality radars

USA:
<br>+ Highest regen rate and cap limit
<br>+ Bofors and VT fuse are available in standard development.
<br>- ALL ships eats MOAR fuel than they do in other navies. (Yamato ate nearly twice as much in USN than in IJN when fully upgraded)
<br>- Torpedo accuracy significantly reduced (not applicable for torpedo bombers in Air Supremacy).

German: 
<br>+ Can develop proto-improved equipment (German science is the best in the world)
<br>+ Excellent in submarine raids. (thanks to U-boats)
<br>- Heavily reliant on foreign navies for aircraft carriers.
