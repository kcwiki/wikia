My Carrier suffer horrible war casualties. Especially the Dive Bomber pilots. I wish to reduce that if possible. If not i still can just retrain the fairies pilots. I only get Air parity at the E-3 boss node.

There are several things that i do think about.<br />train all the fighters to 2 chervon, add one more fighter, or just bear the damage and retrain later.
