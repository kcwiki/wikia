So... I recently just got Kongou as the fourth sister (finally!) so my fourth fleet is unlocked.

I have yet to do 3-4 and 4-1, so what can I do to finally pass it? Which ships do I need to raise to beat it? I'm currently working on raising Haguro to 25. And which ships do I need to get for stats?

I'm more or less a collector (which is why I have a massive list of ships that is locked so I don't delete them), but will also consider best stats ships for events!
