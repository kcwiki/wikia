I have been adding some translations for various equipment that were lacking them, but then I came across Type 14 Air Radar, which even lacked a complete japanese introduction to start with.

So it occured to me that, maybe, there are quite a few of these pages that don't have complete japanese introductions? Incomplete introductions can't possibly be translated properly.

Does someone have a list handy?<ac_metadata title="Which equipment pages still need complete introductions and its translations?"> </ac_metadata>
