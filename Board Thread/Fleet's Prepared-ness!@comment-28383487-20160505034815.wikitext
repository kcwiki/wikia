<p style="font-weight:normal;">[[File:Fleet1_dh38dywi.png|thumb]]Hi, the Spring 2016 Event is my first event. I realize that my ships are too low level to be able to complete the entire event on medium difficulty, but I was wondering if I should clear the first few maps (E-1 & E-2) on medium and clear the later maps (E-3+) on easy.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Also, after I've completed a map, can I farm it for drops or am I locked out from sortieing to it again?</p>

My HQ level is currently 72<ac_metadata title="How many maps can I get away with on Medium?"> </ac_metadata>
