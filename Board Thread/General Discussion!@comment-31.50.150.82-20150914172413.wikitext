As events are usually based around actual Operations conducted by the IJN during the Second World War, with some modifications, it is only a matter of time before an event based around the Attack on Pearl Harbor will be implemented.

This year being the 70th year since the end of the World War 2 it might not be so appropriate as the operation is the most infamous as it pulled America into the war and caused a lot of hate towards the Japanese in America.

Now the devs don't seem to mind changing history to favour this "Kancolle" IJN such as "victory" at Midway, but will they dare to implement it as the backlash I am sure will be greater than before.

Will it be feasible or will they have to make changes if were to implement it such as maybe renaming the Harbor?<ac_metadata title="Pearl Harbor Event"> </ac_metadata>
