I am relatively new to the game considering I've had it for only 2 months. I noticed that some of the fleet girls (like Kongou) have alternate outfits that i can see in the Card Menu. Is it possible to change Kongou into her Shopping outfit somehow? If someone could give me guidance, that would be nice. <ac_metadata title="How do you change basic outfits in KanColle?" lastmove="1523348737"> </ac_metadata>
