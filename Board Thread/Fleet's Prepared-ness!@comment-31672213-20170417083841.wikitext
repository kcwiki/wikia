After experiencing my first event back in February, I want to get some solid advice on having a fleet prepared to tackle Medium Difficulty this time around. Equipment-wise, my carrier-borne aircraft are at max proficiency and I'm working on upgrading equipment to further enhance my surface fleet's power. Really I just feel like I need some direction on which way to go leveling-wise (currently working on Ooshio for her decent combat power and Daihatsu).Â All advice is welcome!



Edit: Resources are F-55k, A-40k, S-13k, and B-17k. The steel's picking back up as I run 37 to level out my ammo with fuel.<ac_metadata title="Wanting to Attempt Medium Difficulty for Spring 2017!"> </ac_metadata>
