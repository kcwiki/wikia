Hello TTK's, im a kind of a new player around here and something is bothering me a lot, the thing is that my fleet is constantly failing its expeditions, i've read the expedition part of the wiki, but i find nothing about my problem in particular, or maybe i just missed that part. Anyway if there is some kind of way you guys could help that'd be great.



Here is a screenshot of said fleet
