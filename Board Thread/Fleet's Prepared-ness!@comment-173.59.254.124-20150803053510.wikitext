The day the event starts, I'll have been playing for about ten days.

At present, I've got HQ level 11, 29 buckets, 1500/1800/2100/900 on resources. Current plan is to minimize resource use and grind 1-5 like mad.

'''Equipments -Â  '''(This is the part where you tell me to abandon all hope)

All running with stock equipment, except for empty slots which have been filled with unimpressive crafted equipment and/or stuff taken from other ships before disposing of them via modernization/scrap. (Crafted List - one each of: Type 0 Recon, 12.7 machine gun, 7.7 machine gun, 14 cm naval gun. And 19 penguins.)<ac_metadata title="Noob&#039;s Easy Prep-Check: How Screwed Am I?"> </ac_metadata>
