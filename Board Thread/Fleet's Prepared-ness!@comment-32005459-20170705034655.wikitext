[[File:Ship_List_2017-07-05.jpg|thumb]][[File:Equipment_List_2017-07-05.jpg|thumb]]Hello! I have just started playing KC like a month ago and I know that my ships and equipments are not probably ready for upcoming event. But I want a taste of my first ever event and if I cant clear early maps on easy but aleast and hopefully get some rare ships . My HQ is 82 and world is up to 3-3 only(3-4 not yet clear), all resources are only about 20k each, 500 buckets, 100 DevT,12 screws, 3 medals as of I wrote this. My resources are quite low but I have been power leveling my CV and BB(F) at 3-2 tagged with CA(V),CL that I think will be useful and if possible at PVP too while making my remaining 3 fleets run expeditions 2,3,5 and run 9,11,12 before I go to sleep. Leveling DD and even CL at 1-5 ,quite slow progress but I am trying.

I will able to get one or two medals at 1st week of August and will be able to get a blueprint. Abukuma is still the best ship to use on it right? Are there any alternatives?

As of current my aim for leveing ships:

Haruna(Kai Ni)- so i can get type 3 shell, Shigure(Kai Ni- two raders, Fubuki- one more Kai Ni DD, Maya(Kai Ni)- for strong CA and AACI, Asashio(Kai Ni)- for one more OASW ship, Myouko sisters all to Kai Ni,Kiso and Kitakami to Kai Ni and honestly i am not sure about which CA(V) to level...

<span style="font-weight:normal;">Plase give any advice on which ship to focus level and just agnore what ship?</span>

Which equipments to craft, i know that my equipments sucks :D but i will try to craft any suggestions in my dalies crafting cuz i cant effort to blow my resources(20k each :D).

Only about one month to go but i will try my best ....:D
