<p style="font-weight:normal;">Hi, is there a way to ensure images are preloaded / loaded when needed? Lately almost all drops and constructions end for me in Kanmusu image missing ... which is unpleasant when meeting a brand new one, should it happen during a wedding ceremony that would be disheartening. I've used regular website, KCV and KC3 and it seems the same for all of them</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Thank you</p><ac_metadata title="Preloading Kanmusu images"> </ac_metadata>
