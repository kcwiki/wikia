I often buy ship slots every once in a while. Today Nagato received her Kai Ni so I decided to buy her a ring.

The process seems normal until I go to Akashi shop. After I click the marriage items icon, the cat bomb appear. My points are lost, but no item.

I tried to do it again, then another 700 points lost.

Today I'm a bit tired, so I can't even feel sad, but well...<ac_metadata title="Money lost when buying with DMM point [Edit: Solved]"> </ac_metadata>
