I am stuck at 2-3 and need a little help on fleet building for 2-3 and beyond. A general party, if you will. Since most look good (bad?) I don't which ones I should level for the main map party.

Also, which ships I should look for and which ones to level right now ? 

Thank you for reading my post. <ac_metadata title="[HQ 23] Playing for three days and need a little direction."> </ac_metadata>
