Hello, 

I'm from France and i want to buy Kan Colle Kai japanese version on ps vita (by play-asia.com). 

But, i don't know if the game is only in japanese or if the game is multi language and is translate in english. 

So, can you tell me if the game is in english pleaseÂ ? 

Thanks<ac_metadata title="Game in english ???"> </ac_metadata>
