For Zara, I Failed desperately, with 700+ runs, only Pola dropped on last fckng hour of the damn event, i have been trying LSC since then, did 150+ LSC, 0 Zara, i even fucking

got yamato...

A friend of mine is trying to convince me if he buys me some resources, i might be able

to finish the event (which is impossible. I Dont want him to waste his money on this idea)

Soo.. what do you guys think? is it possible if he buys me some resources?

(even if he buys some resources it will be roughly 10~15k each)<ac_metadata title="Pure Fail"> </ac_metadata>
