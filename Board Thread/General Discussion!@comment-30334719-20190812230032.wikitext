Can we assemble a fleet of evil shipgirls is my question, come up with suggestions folks.

Disclaimer: if you take offense to describing shipgirls in such a way, then I ask that you please overlook this thread, it's all meant as good fun.

My first candidate is Akitsu Maru, as she is obviously an Abyssal spy and her lantern thing looks kinda ominous.

My second candidate is Kikuzuki, her personality is kinda frightening and I feel like I'm doing something bad by lvling her up, she's gonna destroy the world one day or something.

Maybe Tatsuta, she has that sadistic personality and Yamashiro, she behaves a bit like a witch, arguably even more so because of the miko clothes.<ac_metadata title="A fleet of EVIL shipgirls?"> </ac_metadata>
