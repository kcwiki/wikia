Whenever I try to select a certain destroyer (in my case, Akatsuki), the game immediately crashes and gives me the all-too familiar Error Girl picture. How do I get around so that I can finally put Akatsuki on a fleet?

Apparently I'm not the only one, as a friend is having the same problem with Inazuma. In fact, at one point I had the same problem with Ikazuchi.<ac_metadata title="I crash whenever I try to select a certain destroyer."> </ac_metadata>
