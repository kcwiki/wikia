I was just wondering how difficult it would be to go for a medium clear (or at least SOME of the maps on medium) on this upcoming event. I definitely don't have the resources for it as of this moment and need levels across the board but I'd love some input on what I can specifically work on until the frontrunners are done with their thing (THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FRONTRUNNERS!).

Any help is much appreciated, thank you ^^

Here's what my fleet is looking like right now:
