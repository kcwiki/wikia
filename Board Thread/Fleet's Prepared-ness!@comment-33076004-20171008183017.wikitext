This will be my first big event so I wondering what i need to improve asap. I will be doing it on easy as there is no way i can get enough ships lvled and good equipment in time. Im still doing the mini event so im lvling a lot of my dds to 20. My recorces are preaty low compare to what i need for the event so i'll just list that i have 90 bukets and 50 dev mats.[[File:Ship_List_2017-10-09.jpg|thumb|left|400px]][[File:Equipment_List_2017-10-09.jpg|thumb|left|398px]]<ac_metadata title="First event.
