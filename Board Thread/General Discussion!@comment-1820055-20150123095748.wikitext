So home port expansion limit increased again, and Winter Event is coming. So let's do one more WebMoney Event.

Just reply "'''currahee!'''" to this post and one person will randomly win. Yes this time around it's totally RNG-based. Even I do not know who will win. Don't ask me the picking mechanics further. Same rules apply like previous WebMoney events, must have wikia account, etc.....

For more regular WebMoney give-aways, visit [http://www.himeuta.net/ himeuta channel], if I've heard it correctly that they also do some events there.

why currahee - I recently watched band of brothers again on HBO. <ac_metadata title="WebMoney IX: Winter 2015" related_topics="General Discussion"> </ac_metadata>
