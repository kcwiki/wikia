Hello i've started ~1 month ago and it will be my 1st event

i would want to finish at easy, or if possible mixed with some medium.

while trying to lvl up my dds at 4-3 to decent lvls, i'm planing to k2 Souryuu, Haruna, Hiei and Tone (BP to get 2nd CAV)

i'm wondering how much resources i should spend on 4-3 dd grind to pass event safely ( dunno how it will be next days but today troll-sama send me to J node 40/50 runs >.> )

HQ 94 lvl
