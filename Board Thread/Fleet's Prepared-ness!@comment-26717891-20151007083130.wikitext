I was wondering lately, about the state of my fleet, which is clearly understaffed for the average level I see from others TTKs of my level (almost 100 now)

One thing I especially lack are CLs.

Apart the mandatory Sendai, Ooyodo and Yuubari, I don't have much more leveled ships of the class.

So I was wondering, which CL should I start grind after I'm done with Abukuma?

Any suggestion?<ac_metadata title="Suggestions for grinding"> </ac_metadata>
