So, am I ready for the next event and/or 4-2? Atm. I am trying to lv my CAs, but it just takes for ever to do so. Know any good leveling spots? Or should I focus on a different class all together atm.?[[File:Ship_list_atm.png|thumb]][[File:Equipment_atm.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Ready for next event?"> </ac_metadata>
