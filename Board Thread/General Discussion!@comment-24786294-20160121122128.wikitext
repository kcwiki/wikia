[[File:Screenshot_012116_21.02.35001.png|thumb]]After lastest update on Kancolle I got very often catbomb but not too short interval so i decided to refresh game page and continue playing from last two day.

<span style="font-size:13.3333px;font-weight:normal;">Also clear all cached file to fix it but it still happen</span>

but today I finally hit by banhammer while grinding as always

(cat appeared, then refreshed and got banned)
