Is there anything in my fleet that I can improve on to make the next event easier?

I have 200k fuel, 190k Steel, 100k Ammo and 100k Bauxite. I'll be stockpiling soon so it shouldn't be too much of an issue (I hope).

I also have another protodeck, but I'm afraid that Sara's gonna need it for her Kai-ni, so I'm holding off on it.[[File:2017-03-25_Ship_List.png|thumb]][[File:2017-03-25_Equipment_List.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Where should I improve?"> </ac_metadata>
