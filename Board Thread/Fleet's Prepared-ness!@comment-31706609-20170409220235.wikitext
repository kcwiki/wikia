I've actually returned to KanColle after a year of inactivity so I figured looking for help with ship composition to work for 3-2 and 4-1 because I'm having trouble with them. Obviously not ready for the upcoming event, but I guess trying it at least once wouldn't hurt.

Here's my ships and equipment below.

 I'm thinking that my priorities are as listed:

1. Find Kongou (she apparently don't exist thanks to RNG) to unlock my fourth fleet.

2. Kai-Ni Ooi and Yuudachi.

3. Work on the quipment. I'll be looking at the equipment setup guide as I'll be trying to

defeat the 3-2 and 1-4 boss nodes.

What do you think I need to do first? Any advice will be appreciated! Thank you.<ac_metadata title="Newbie Admiral seeking help"> </ac_metadata>
