Ok so,

E1 HARD E2E3 MEDIUM, + farm, especially if there's Littorio and Roma (Tanaka please, I believe in you) 

I don't really know about my fleet tho, since it will probably be a TP heavy event? Oh and my rsc ay, you guys make me cringe with your 300k rsc

Considering my rsc, should I do all ez modo + farm? But since Tanaka's a bitch, he will prbably put some rare ships for medium+ only (Well we'll see)

OH AND TALKING ABOUT SHIPS, WHO'S I-401 HAHaha gosh I'm a failure
