My current resource count is 21k fuel, 21k ammo, 21k steel,15k bauxite + 542 buckets. I'll most likely start stockpiling after the next update.

Only my lv30+ DDs are listed but I also have Kasumi (lv11). I don't have Kiyoshimo and Asashimo.

I'm currently training Abukuma to K2, Akitsumaru and Ooyodo to kai. It'd be helpful if I could know who else I shou[[File:2016fuyueq2.png|thumb|equipments]]ld train in the time left.

I also need advice on improving equipments. So far, the more significant equipments I've improved are:

12.7cm-B gun ★4 (x4)

20.3(2) <span style="font-weight:normal;">★1 (x2) </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">★2 (x2)</span>

41cm <span style="font-weight:normal;">★1 (x3)</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">35.6 </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">★2 (x8)</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">T91 AP shell </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">★6 (x6)</span>

<span style="font-weight:normal;">T94 AAFD </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">★8 (x1)</span>

Also, since I have 4 Maruyus and I'll be using them for 3-2 grinding, would it be worth to do LSC and spend resources to try getting one more, or should I just focus on training and stockpiling and hope to get Maruyus in the event?

Thanks in advance for any advice!<ac_metadata title="Advice for medium/hard difficulty mix?"> </ac_metadata>
