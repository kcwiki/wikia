Since I'm really interested about the game, but I don't have the chance to play it I was wondering if anyone knows about let's plays or youtube series about kancolle arcade that I could follow. Possibly a well developed series of videos instead of a few random gameplay videos. (Obviously if they're all in japanese is fine too)

Thank you for you attention o/<ac_metadata title="Kancolle Arcade let&#039;s play"> </ac_metadata>
