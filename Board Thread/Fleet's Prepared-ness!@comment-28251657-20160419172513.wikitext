This is my first event that I am really trying to prepare for. I've been around but only started reading up about how to equip your girls and what gear to have only 2 weeks ago. I want Iowa but I wouldn't mind also farming the event maps for some drops.

Running only 1-5 EO since I'm not confident in my gear to run other things. <span style="font-weight:normal;">I'm running expeditions for Fuel/Steel/Bauxite.</span> Currently I'm grinding my CAs one at a time and 3 DDs at a time alongside a FBB. I rotate consistently and am trying to develop better planes. I know my ASW is suffering but its still enough for my fleet to dominate 1-5 even with HQ level 90.

I'd like any and all advice/criticism on the upcoming and event, maybe other EOs I should shoot for, that kind of thing.
