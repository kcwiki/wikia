Continuation of the discussion here: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:206780

Moved because it's technically off-topic, but important.

Currently:

Regarding 改:
*Anything that denotes the number of remodels will simply be Romanized. This will not be translated. 
**改   -> Kai 
**改二 -> Kai Ni
**改三 -> Kai San
**改四 -> Kai Yon
**Zwei -> Zwei
**Drei -> Drei

Also:
*型 -> Model
*式 -> Type
*号 -> No. or -Go (as a suffix)
** Will only be translated into No. when part of "Special Attribute"; otherwise will remain as a suffix, e.g. 13-Go
*甲 -> A
*乙 -> B
*丙 -> C

As a general rule, I think that we should order the names in a certain way:
*For guns, torpedoes and anything else that has a calibre:
**Calibre > Number > Equipment Type > Special Attributes
*** Calibre refers to the width of the barrel/tube
*** Number refers to the number of barrels/tubes
*** Equipment type refers to the type of weaponry it is, e.g. Gun, Torpedo, etc.
*** Special attribute refers to any special features, such as FlaK, bow mounted, etc.
** An example will be made to fully explain this using the 25mm三連装機銃 集中配備 "25mm Triple Autocannon (Concentrated Deployment)"
*** Calibre is 25mm
*** Number is Triple
*** Type is Autocannon (calibre is 25mm or above)
*** Special Attribute is Concentrated Deployment
*For items which don't have a calibre:
**Model > Type of craft or object > Additional Model Information > Special Attributes
*** Model refers to the model name of the type of object
*** Type of craft or object refers to what category of item the piece of equipment falls under
**** Can be either written or implied
*** Special attributes refers to any special attributes the equipment may have, such as squadron name, more in-depth details about model, or any other information that doesn't fit in either the "model" or "type" category
** An example will be made to fully explain this using the 天山一二型(友永隊) "Tenzan Model 12 (Tomonaga Squadron)"
*** The model of 天山一二型(友永隊) would be "天山" (Tenzan)
*** 天山一二型(友永隊) is a torpedo bomber (艦攻), but this is implied (i.e. known to be of this type, but not written in the name)
**** Unlike something such as 九七式艦攻 (Type 97 Torpedo Bomber) where the fact that it is a torpedo bomber is written in the name
*** The Additional Model Information for the 天山一二型(友永隊) is the 一二型 (Model 12), specifying the model of Tenzan it is
*** The 友永隊 is the Special Attribute, stating the fact that it's in the Tomonaga Squadron
'''Any Special Attribute will be put into parenthesis unless otherwise specified.'''

A list of specific translation rules is below:
# For calibre-existent equipment:

#*** 単装   -> Single

#*** 三連装 -> Triple
#*** 四連装 -> Quadruple
#*** etc. Up to 10.
#*** Anything higher will simply have the number of barrels/tubes.
