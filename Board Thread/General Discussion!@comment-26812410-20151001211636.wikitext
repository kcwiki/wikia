Today's my grandmother birthday, which got me a pretty neat idea for kancolle: birthday lines

Imagine this: You can input your birthday, and once you're done, you can't change it anymore, then, the day of your birthday your kanmusus start congrating you similar to the seasonal lines, but with a birthday theme for you, wouldn't be that awesome?<ac_metadata title="Birthday lines"> </ac_metadata>
