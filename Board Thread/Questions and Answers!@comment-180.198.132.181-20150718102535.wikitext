<p class="MsoNormal">Pleas help, I can't get<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>a new API- link. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>I have the official game on DMM.com bookmarked , normally it opens the game immediately from where i would get a new API-link once a month and after updates .</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, after the maintenance ended, <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>I tried getting a new API , after logging in the site prompt me to change the password , after completing that and logging in with the new password it opens the Kancolle home page instead of the game , even my old bookmark leads me there , and i can't find a way to access <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>the actual game window. The big red button leads me to the game registration <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>. I am logged in DMM.com but it doesn't seem it gets that i am already registered to Kancolle .I can still access the game thru Kancolle Viewer on my old API.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Or maybe i am just stupid <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>and missing something obvious <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>, any advice would be appreciated.</p>
