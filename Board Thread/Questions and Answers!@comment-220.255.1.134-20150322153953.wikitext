So... I have yet to get all the kongou sisters (only kongou atm) and as such, I haven't unlocked a fourth fleet. Should I spam craft the bb recipe which may result in me getting other types of kantai, Grind for them in world 2 (I am pretty unlucky with this :/ ) or should I try a Lsc construction which people have been complaining about getting too many of them sisters?<ac_metadata title="Kongou sisters."> </ac_metadata>
