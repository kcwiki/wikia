Hello,

Just wondering if my fleet at the moment is ready for the up coming large scale event.

I've been spamming the expos: 2, 21, 37, 38 for quite some time and doing 2-3 on a leisurely basis.

Resouces: 70,000/66,000/100,000/68,000    [Approximate figures]

Buckets: 784

Would appreciate some tips for anything that seems off. If new data is needed just ask and ill post up the most recent resouces, buckets etc. or what ever is needed or of interest.

Aimming between a mixture of medium and easy for this event.
