1) I have a-lot of ships who need BP's now. (Yamashiro, Bismark (She needs 2, she is lvl 77 soon, tho.), Fusou, Tone, Chikuma, Choukai, Amagi, Taigei.), Tho in order of importance, Yamashiro (altho still needs like 7 lvls) will get hers before Bismark (lacking prototype 41cm and i wanna have better seaplanes in general.)

My question is, I can already beat (easly) 1-5 and 2-5, but idk if i should attempt 3-5 and 4-5 yet (altho my hq rank is almsot 100, and idk if my ships are like "prepared" for more EO in general). What should i do?

2) I saw some ppl taking pics with like some program (that shows the ships lvl equips and such), what is that "thing" and how do i use get it? (idk what its name even.)

3) Regarding some quests, how do you even beat the quest that requires Uzuki, Mutsuki, Yayoi and Mochizuki to beat 1-5 and get a C rank at my current HQ lvl at all? it seems practicly impossible to beat.

4) LSC stuff- should i attempt to TRY and maybe get I-401 and Yamasushi and Taihou, or just beat more maps and EO isntead? (I can do up to 5-2, im planin on clearing world 5 this month or so.)

Ty in advance, and sorry im still KINDA new to this. (im pretty dumb as it is.)<ac_metadata title="General questions for knowledge and progression"> </ac_metadata>
