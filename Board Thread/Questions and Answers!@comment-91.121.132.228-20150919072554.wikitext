Right now, I cleared 5-4 a couple of days ago and unlocked 6-1. Unfortunately, my resources are still cripplingly low from the event:

7000 fuel, 10000 ammo, 8500 steel, 100 bauxite, 0 bucket

I don't have Shoukaku, Nagato, Uzuki, Taigei, Akashi or Katori but have most other non-event shipgirls at usable levels; I have Fusou and Tone at kai2 but no other BP remodels and no medals, and didn't manage to get the experimental kanpan :(

I also have Musashi and Taihou, but not Yamato or Bismarck.

What would other admirals suggest I do to get hold of Shoukaku (and other rare girls) while rebuilding my resources? The lack of bauxite is partly because I've been using 300/30/400/330 for daily construction, but all I seem to get is Chitoses and Kinus...<ac_metadata title="Advice for progression"> </ac_metadata>
