Adobe plans to stop to support their Flash. Browser developers are stopping support as well. In fact they already started.

Did the developers already drop any hint what they want to do in future without Flash?<ac_metadata title="Any plans of developers when Adobe (and browsers) stop Flash support?"> </ac_metadata>
