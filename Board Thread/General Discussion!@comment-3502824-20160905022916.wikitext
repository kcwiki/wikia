To Malaysian Players:

As per multiple reports, It is currently suspected that Malaysian ISPs have started banning DMM by DNS table, which means that to play KanColle, you are likely required to use VPN for both unfortunately.

It mostly seems KanColle Android was most affected by this. 

Malaysian Players are reporting that Computer KanColle is fine but KanColle Android keeps showing Connection Errors when the game starts unless VPN is used. 

Currently the only other known method so far to have this be resolved is to use Google's DNS or Open DNS

Long story short: Malaysia has started to become like Indonesia >_>;;

If any Malaysian Players are having this issue but were able to resolve it, please report.

Also if you don't have this issue "yet", please report which ISP you are using.

Your Cooperation is appreciated.
