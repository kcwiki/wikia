I was planning for all hard back then last event, but at some point I chose my sanity over my pride. So no first-class for me. In the end, I got Teruzuki but I fell so ashamed of myself. I can't even see my kanmusus in the eyes anymore. I feel sorry for them for getting a fail ttk like me.

Ok enough stupid drama haha.

So THIS EVENT, I'm going al hard no mather what. Even if Tanaka lied and make this event even harder than last event. 

So here's my fleet. Is there something I'm missing that possibly screw me over? Or is there any possible new mechanic that probably can fuck me up? Any advice is so appriciated!
