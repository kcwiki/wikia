[[File:List_part_1.png|thumb]][[File:List_part_2.png|thumb]]Hai. I've been playing for a long while now. As in, Spring 2015 was my first event. The amount of progress that I've made over the course of the year is pitiful compared to many others on here; I've seen people get to where I am in terms of resources and levels in under 2 months. Still, I digress, and plan to have this event to be the first time I actually complete an event.

Save your laughter until the end, pl0x :v

Is completing the event on Easy feasible with my current ships? I appreciate any wisdom y'all shall impart upon mine skrubÂ head ;w;<ac_metadata title="How about another &quot;am i reddy b0ss&quot; thread?"> </ac_metadata>
