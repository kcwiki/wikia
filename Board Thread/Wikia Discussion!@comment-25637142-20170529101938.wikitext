;What is this?
:This is a '''training exercise''' to prepare our new trainees for upcoming KanColle events.

;Who can sign up for this?
:Anyone who're keen on giving back to the community and don't know how are welcome to sign up for this drill. Training and mentorship will be provided as part of the drill.

;How does this work?
:In this exercise, we'll attempt to emulate the conditions of a real event by introducing a set of mock-up tweets, fleet composition report sheets, PoiDB dump data, frontline reports and game assets. The trainee team must compile these mock-up data into a complete Event Page, along with any accompanying articles, threads and infrastructures. Information will be introduced to the trainees via designated channels and at a specific order similar to what they can expect from an actual event.

:For this first drill, there will be no vandalism or misinformation.

;Where to sign up?
:Applications for the first drill event has been closed, please stay tuned in on [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Board:Wikia_Discussion| the Wikia Discussions board] once the first one is over!
