So, the next event will be my 1st and I intend to stick with easy mode all the way. Here is my fleet

All top level ships are max modernized but my equipments are poor:

- Air force: Only 2 Reppus, 1 Shiden K2, 1 Ryuusei, 1 Suisei 12A, alot Tenzans and Suiseis, Fighter 52 all max >>, 1 Saiun, 1 Type 2 Recon, 2 Ju 87C Kai (from quests), 2 Zuiun (634 AG)

- AWS: 3 or 4 T3 Sonars, 2 T3 DC, lots T93 Sonars+DC

- 2 T91 AP shells, 3 T3 shell, 2 Daihatsus

- Everything else are all stock

Is this enough for farming rare ship and finish the event at easy mode? In case the medium reward is hard to refuse, can I do it with current fleet? Which ship should I focus on leveling now? (I've already unlocked 3-4 and 4-4)<ac_metadata title="Need advices for upcoming Spring 2017 event"> </ac_metadata>
