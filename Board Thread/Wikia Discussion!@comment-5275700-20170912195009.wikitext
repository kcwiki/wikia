Hi Kancolle Wiki

FANDOM is conducting a small test that will compare usage of the [[Help:VisualEditor|Visual Editor]] with the usage of the [[Help:Classic editor|classic editor]]. The purpose of the test is to determine which editor brings more success to newer users. As part of that test, we will be disabling the Visual Editor as the default editor on this community for several months. Users who have the Visual Editor selected in their [[Help:Preferences|user preferences]] will get the classic editor when clicking the main 'Edit' button during the test period. However, VisualEditor will remain available as the secondary editing option on the 'Edit' drop-down menu.

I am letting the community leadership know about this test since some users may be surprised by the altered experience. Giving them a different experience is the point of the test, of course. We request that you refrain from making any community-wide announcement about the test; to get the most accurate results, it's better for users to have no expectation of a change before they encounter it. Obviously this post is public, and it's fine to point individual users here if they inquire about the change.

Please let us know if you have any questions! Thank you.<ac_metadata title="FANDOM is researching how fans edit on your community"> </ac_metadata>
