Hello!

My HQ level is 79 and I fell like my fleet should be better at this point. I'm kinda scared of leveling ships to kai ni, you know, it's so timetaking and boring, even though I have much time and nothing to do. Clearing all maps of event isn't actually that important to me, on Summer 2015 I've cleared only 3 on easy and I think that's succes since my preparations sucked. So, on what should I focus? 

Sorry for any mistakes etc, I hope it's understandable. <ac_metadata title="Is my fleet okay?"> </ac_metadata>
