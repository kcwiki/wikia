Hey Wiki,

I occasionally pop in here to comment on lore and other related bits, and one thing that I've noticed is the comparative lack of secondary works (fanfiction, roleplays, art, etc) insofar as I can find googling about. Googling literally gets me to World of Warship's forums. 

That being said, I've got a roleplaying system that I think some of the English-speaking community might enjoy trying out. Do you have any advice in where I could set-up and advertise, or where I might find a few players that could be interested in trying one out? 

Thanks~<ac_metadata title="KanColle Roleplaying."> </ac_metadata>
