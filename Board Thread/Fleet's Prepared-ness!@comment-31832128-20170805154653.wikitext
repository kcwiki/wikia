I thought I could challenge all hard at last, but some Japanese friends told me, "You are not ready enough, so impossible."

So, it might be too late, But I'm thinking what I can do in the last week.

Then, So please give me some advice.
1. Should I have a second Kitakami Kai Ni, Ooi Kai Ni and Abukuma Kai Ni? (Or is there any other ship that needs the 2nd one?)

2. What should be improved, Guns, Torps, Seaplane Fighters and Radars are top priority?  Friends said that you should buy screws and improve all.  <span style="font-weight:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:"LucidaGrande","HiraginoKakuGothicProN",Meiryo,sans-serif;font-size:14px;">(⊃ Д)⊃≡ﾟ ﾟ</span>

3. Should I marry someone? (I am not married to anyone right now)

Ships and Equipments list is here. And I have 299k/298k/300k/293k res and 2985 buckets. I can do 5-4 power leveling.



Since time is limited, I'd like to run it from where I can do somehow.<ac_metadata title="What in a week can I prepare?"> </ac_metadata>
