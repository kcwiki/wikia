We all know how tedious farming could be. And more than that, having to think about allocating time and resource to make sure you have enough to complete the event should you choose to farm first on easy difficulty for consistent S-ranks is even more troublesome.

The fundamental mechanic of the game is RNG so I'm not going to change that. Instead, why not make rare ship drop rate get a small increase each time an S-rank is achieved? If a rare ship happens to drop, the rate then resets to the base value. It can be for all relevant ships or it could be just for that particular ship. This would be a more fair approach to the dedicated TTK who had been putting their time and effort in making sure they get an S-rank for a chance at the desired ship.

Sometimes, the most limiting resource is not fuel, ammo, steel, bauxite, buckets, and even morale. Time is resource you cannot get back and depending on RNG and how much you're willing to give time for farming, you'll be in a dire pinch when you know full well the event is something you can truly accomplish. Once the timer ticks, that's all you get. <ac_metadata title="Game drop chance mechanic." lastmove="1449620264"> </ac_metadata>
