Good day wikians! I just want to ask for feedback on how we run event threads.

1) For the past few events, we've been running "'''Report Threads'''", with the recent ones having [[Thread:172611|composition counting mechanism]]:
* Is there something we can improve?
* Shall we still re-use the counting mechanism?
* Do you even make use of the reports of others?
* Do we still run them in the coming events?


2) There are also resource '''[[Thread:169082|before-after resource comparison (and medals)]]''' threads:
* Isn't it useful in any way for you?
* Don't you like seeing other people's resource and medals?
* It is better posted on people's blogs and profile rather than compiled on a thread?


3) Enemy Composition
* shall we put it on the event template and let anyone to edit and add enemy patterns?
* or do we retain enemy reports on threads and have someone compile it?


Any other feedback is appreciated, thanks!
