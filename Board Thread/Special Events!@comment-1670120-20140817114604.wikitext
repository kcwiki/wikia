I've been hearing this thing about effective LoS being thrown around in various places. There's some iffyness about the actual formula of calculation but it goes something like this:

'''[Equipment LoS] + [Plane LoS] + sqrt{fleet base LoS}'''

or

'''[Equipment LoS] + 2x[Plane LoS] + sqrt{fleet base LoS}'''

Apparently it's been around since the Spring event, and needless to say it seems viable somewhat but the numbers aren't solid. Has anyone else heard about this before and if so, does it deserve to have a place somewhere on this Events page?<ac_metadata title="Effective LoS?"> </ac_metadata>
