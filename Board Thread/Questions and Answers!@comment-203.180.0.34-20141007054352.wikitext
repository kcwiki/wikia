So i have been playing this game for weeks now and all of a sudden my desktop computer is unable to connect to VPN using SoftEther VPN Client (Error (Error Code 2): Protocol error occurred. Error was returned from the destination server.), even API link wouldn't work (keep getting the cat error message). The weird thing is, my laptop using the wifi connection from the same router is able to connect to VPN and use the API link without any problem. Tried using a new software (OpenVPN, link here: http://www.vpngate.net/en/howto_openvpn.aspx#windows) in which connection to website is made possible, but i still get the cat error message after pressing the game start button. Got new API link and it still wouldn't work.

Any idea what's the problem here?<ac_metadata title="API / VPN connection problem"> </ac_metadata>
