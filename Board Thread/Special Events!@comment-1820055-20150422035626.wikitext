This is an attempt to gather fleet composition reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-1</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Spring 2015 Event]] comments.

<span style="color: red;">Please do not remove the "text_only" variable from the template. As some people are having issues loading so many ship card images, they are being switched to text format. Thank you for your understanding in this matter.</span>
