Welcome to the 15,727th thread on what equipment I should be using for my fleet!

While I'm confident that my fleet will perform well enough for the event, I think I'm missing equipment that might be worth grinding for.

'''I'm going to tell you what I have. I want to know if there is something better or really useful that I can get in a few days that isn't in the list.'''



For '''(DD)''', I have these Main guns: Green 10cm, Green 12.7 (Late Model), Red 12.7 (B Kai 2), Red 120mm

Torpedos: Triple (Oxygen) 61cm, Quadruple (Oxygen) 61cm, Quintuple (Oxygen) 61cm



For '''(CL)''' - Main: Red 15.2cm, Yellow 15.2cm, Red 15.5cm, Yellow 15.5cm, 20.3, 20.3 (2), 20.3 (3), <span style="font-weight:normal;">OTO 152mm</span>

Also, should I use any of the 20.3s on my CLs or just give them to my CAs? I'm not sure how the fit bonus works.
