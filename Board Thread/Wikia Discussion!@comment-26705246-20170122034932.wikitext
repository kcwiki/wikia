As the title says, I'm unable to post comments due to a problem with my login session. I've tried signing out and logging back in, visiting my profile page and even opening/closing the browser.

This is the error message I'm getting.

"<span style="color:rgb(81,22,22);font-weight:normal;">There seems to be a problem with your login session; this action has been canceled as a precaution against session hijacking. Go back to the previous page, reload that page and then try again."</span>

As the message says, I've tried refreshing the current page, reloading the current page, navigating back a page, doing a refresh/reload and then navigating back to the page I was on, all without any luck.

Is the wikia currently having problems of some sort, or is something borked on my end?

(edit) whatever it was, it seems to have resolved itself.<ac_metadata title="Unable to post comments - apparent session problem."> </ac_metadata>
