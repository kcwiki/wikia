[[File:Altheashowcase20160120.png|thumb]][[File:Althea_equipment_20160120.png|thumb]]I am planning for easy and medium difficulties. My first run with event wasn't too great, so I am preparing large amount of salts. These are my current fleet status, and who do I need to level up as soon as possible + what equipments need to be developed ASAP? At the moment my resources stats are 1.6k fuel/2.1k ammo/1.9k metal/10k bux/168 bucket



PS: I am hoping to farm for Graf.
