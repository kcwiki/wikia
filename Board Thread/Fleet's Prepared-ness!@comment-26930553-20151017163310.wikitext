Wondering if I could be able to go for all-medium clear and maybe one or two maps on hard. I was also wondering if I am able to use Yamato for the event with her current level? 

- for Ooyodo I did 100 sorties already this month and I gave up on her for this event

- I will Kai Ni Chikuma at the beginning of next month too (else Tone will be lonely)

- I have no BPs left after Chikuma

- this is only my 2nd event I am a total beginner

any help appreciated <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Arial;font-size:14.4px;font-weight:normal;line-height:normal;">(´• ω •`) ♡</span>
