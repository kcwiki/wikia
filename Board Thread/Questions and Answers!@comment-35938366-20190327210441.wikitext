[[File:Fusou_Recorded_Dialogue.jpg|thumb|Fusou data catalogue page showing extra recorded dialogues.]]So I was browsing through the in-game ship catalogue and saw that Fusou has four extra recorded dialogues to play. The first one even had multiple other ships joining in, and was quite lenghty. I don't know what these are. Anyone know what they are, and where I can find the transcript for them? <ac_metadata title="Fusou extra recorded dialogues" related_topics="Fusou"> </ac_metadata>
