This is as of today. I'm still doing quests and levelling to get more girls up and resources and buckets increasing as well.

Planning on doing easy straight and only planned for just clearing the event. Sometimes I will farm, but that's not my goal ultimately.

I have 5 medals in my disposal.

My priorities:

-Modernise all ships that will be involved in the event.

-Get Sendai (and maybe Jintsuu as well) to K2 range

-Get Shigure, Yuudachi, Hatsushimo and Ayanami on par with Fubuki's level

-Get Mikuma to CAV

-Get Maya to high enough level<ac_metadata title="Prepared for Easy?"> </ac_metadata>
