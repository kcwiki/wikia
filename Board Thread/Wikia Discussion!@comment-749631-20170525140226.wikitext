According to my understanding, the user gained bureaucrat position of the wiki by starting the wiki at the beginning of the time. However, since then the user have already went inactive for more than 3 years, haven't logged in for more than a year, and have only ever made 9 edits to the wiki (comment and wall message included). ANd from experience I have learnt recently from other wikis, having an inactive member as a bureaucrat could be a bad idea.

As such, I suggest removing [[User:Lycoris Aura]] from the wiki's bureaucrat position. According to wikia guidance, a community consensus would need to be reached in order to remove a user from their bureaucrat's status. Please express your opinion below. <ac_metadata title="Suggestion: Remove the bureaucrat position of [[User:Lycoris Aura]]"> </ac_metadata>
