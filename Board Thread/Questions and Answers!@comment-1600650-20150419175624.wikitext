I might be a little paranoid, but it's better safe than sorry.

So, tonight my internet connection was rather unstable. I was disconnected 4 times while I was sortie-ing in under 2 hours. I am trying to finish some of the almost done weekly quest, but the amount of DC I had tonight is rather alarming. So, is this number can get me dangerously near to get banned? I rather miss the weekly quest than get banned :/<ac_metadata title="What are the chance of getting banned due to unstable connection?"> </ac_metadata>
