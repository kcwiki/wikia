|EN01 = But wait, there's more! Sure, Setsubun is important, but new remodels are also important! Which is why the KanColle development team is currently preparing the second remodel of one of our best standard aircraft carriers as well as a certain aviation battleship who fought hard as the 4th Carrier Division. But wait, there's even more! (TBC)

|EN02 = Furthermore, we're also working on the second remodel of a certain destroyer of the core of the main force that were the Type-A destroyers, and, since it's been a while, the second remodel of a certain battleship that is going to pack quite a punch. When our preparations are complete, we won't wait until actual spring, but try to implement each of them between now i.e. winter and early spring. Now there's something to look forward to!
