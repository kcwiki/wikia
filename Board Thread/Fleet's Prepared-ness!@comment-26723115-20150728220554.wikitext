since i'm a fairly new player i don't have amazingly good equipment 

for the upcoming event i thinking about doing easy mode  to get a feeling how events work and such

in the image below you can see the equipment i got atm. i have been focusing on fighter planes for the past few weeks. and i don't know what other equipment i should definitly get before the event. should i get more fighterplanes  or should i focus on getting somethinng else like radars and such and how many should i get of each equipment.

again this is only for easy mode to get a feeling, i just want to know what i shoul prioritize to get 

thanks alot in advance for your help ^_^[[File:EquipmentBKbeer.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="can you give me advice for which equipment to get for easy mode please"> </ac_metadata>
