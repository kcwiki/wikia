After pondering for quite a while, I never had the chance to taste being in the top 500 or so. But after finding out that my ranking is always on 100 to 150 (After clearing the 3 EO maps), it justseems to to be impossible. So here is the reason why I'm asking this, how do we prepare for fleet rankings and How do WE get in the rankings?



My HQ level is 101... I haven't finished all the maps yet (I'm currently handling 5-3 and am not planning to go even further).



Say, can someone like me really be on the rankings? That uncertainty is really bothering a TTK like me...<ac_metadata title="Fleet Preparedness... For Fleet Rankings &gt;."> </ac_metadata>
