Hey there. I finally came to a slot dillema. Till February I'm not gonna be buying more slots :(.

Soo... What you guys think, scrap Wakaba (lvl 61)? Or someone knows something about she getting K2 or being important in future events?

I've already completed all Wakaba questlines.

Even though she has sentimental value to me (one of my first ships, always liked her "gangster look"), I've just been sending her to expeditions lately. And one extra slot will give me a breather.<ac_metadata title="Scrap Wakaba?"> </ac_metadata>
