Been running the 2 DD+2 AV+2 CL composition for 3-5 during the past month as a method to clear BW7 and overall it's gone pretty well.

It's cheaper to run than 3-3, though repair costs might put it somewhere closer to even. 3-3 costs roughly 3 battles worth of resources before being off-routed half the time, whereas in the case of 3-5 you could just refresh at the start and do something else till moral regenerates. Even if the cost were to end up even, at least 3-5 is easier on San due to not relying on the compass.

The way I'm running it is most likely not the most effective way, but perhapsÂ 2 DD+2 AV+2 CL 3-5 might be more viable for BW7 than 3-3? Can somebody with more know-how look over this option?[[File:Screenshot_23sfs.png|left]]<ac_metadata title="2 DD+2 AV+2 CL 3-5 for BW7?"> </ac_metadata>
