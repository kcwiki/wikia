Hey, I have a few questions about the fleet preparedness again. [http://imgur.com/a/0XlSY Fleet & Equipment is here.]

Currently I have only 1 medal, but 3 other will come in no time, so I need to choose a ship to use '''blueprint '''on. Can't decide between Shoukaku and Fusou. Maybe Amagi?

As Akashi finally dropped now I can '''upgrade''' equipment. For now there are 6 screws. What should I '''improve?'''

Last event E-6 and E-7 were kind of difficult imo.<ac_metadata title="Fleet Preparedness"> </ac_metadata>
