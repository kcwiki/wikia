Hello I started playing KC on android 6 months ago. I played it for a month and dropped it. Then today , I wanted to start it again. I didn't deleted it so I just updated and opened the app. I choosed the only server available and got into the game but It started me from the tutorial. What should I do now to get my progress back ???<ac_metadata title="Account Gone"> </ac_metadata>
