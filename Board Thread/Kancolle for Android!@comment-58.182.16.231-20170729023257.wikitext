Hi there! I'd appreciate any help you guys can provide me because I've exhausted pretty much all my options, the troubleshooting guide doesn't seem to be too effective either.

So recently, kancolle started acting up on my Samsung galaxy A9 pro, it was working just fine for about 4months but now it can't seem to start, it does however work fine on the pc version. It usually gives me a black screen, has long loading times or gets stuck on "dmm games", all of which leads mostly lead to catbombs. The few times it does start up usually gets catbomb'd when I do something that requires changes to be saved.

So far I've tried clearing the cache, restarting my phone, reinstalling both kancolle and the dmm game store and changing timezones. I'm not on a vpn and have no clue whats going on, send help.

Phone specs are

Storage: 32gb
Processor: 1.8GHz octa-core
Ram: 4gb
Operating system: android 6.0

Again, any help will be very much appreciated!<ac_metadata title="Kancolle can&#039;t seem to work right"> </ac_metadata>
