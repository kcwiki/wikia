Hi!

This will be my 3rd event, and I'm really hoping I can get my first first class medal from this event. The problem is, I started working full time right after finishing the summer event (HHMEEME) so I'm quite pressed for time (especially prep-wise), even stopping PvP and all transport/carrier quests.

<span style="font-weight:normal;">Apart from exp 2, 21, 37/38, I'm only grinding 3-2A. Mutsu and Houshou are permanently leeching so their levels will be going up, and my free slot currently goes to Akatsuki (lv 67 -> 70).</span>

Any guidance (prioritization) would be greatly appreciated!

Here's my fleet:

Equipment (81 screws)

upgraded equipment: seven 12.7cm MAX, five 35.6cm +5, two T91AP +6, two 10cmHA+AAFD +4



<p style="font-weight:normal;">I currently have 2 blueprints, and originally I was going to make my choice during the summer event but I ended up completing it without using any blueprints.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;">I'm currently doing 10/10/10/10 for the development quests; do I need to aim for more reppuu?</p>

Lastly here are my resources, which I believe is enough (already finished the fishing event).

In conclusion, can I take it easy now and complete the event on hard mode with what I've got at the moment? If not, what would be the most urgent area that needs working on (CL lv, AS lv, Shimakaze's lv, Tone/Chikuma, more k2 DD etc.)? Even though I'm only running 3-2A, I'm open to other suggestions that are effective/efficient (though I haven't passed 5-2 yet)

Thanks in advance!!<ac_metadata title="Will I be able to obtain my first medal?"> </ac_metadata>
