The latest ranking awards had Mk.1 16-inch guns in three varints and a rocket anti-air defense, that to me look British.  And if it is, then if my memory serves correct.  The only British battleship during the war that had 16-inch guns were the Nelson-class.  Now, can please correct or prove me wrong, beause I'm confuse. <ac_metadata title="Is a Nelson-class battleship going to be added next?" related_topics="Recent Updates" lastmove="1533242135"> </ac_metadata>
