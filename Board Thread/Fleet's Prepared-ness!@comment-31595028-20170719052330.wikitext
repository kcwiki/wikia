Last event I failed to rescue Gangut (mostly cause I spent 100k resources on farming Littorio), but do you think I'll be able to do an all Hard this time?

Im at 100k for each resource (and I might be able to double it sans baux before the event if I play my cards really well) and I have 3 BPs.Â 

Where should I go and what should I do?[[File:Equipment_List_2017-07-19.jpg|thumb]][[File:Ship_List_2017-07-19.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Can I do all hard?"> </ac_metadata>
