Hi, Right now i have 87 screws. There's so many equipments I want to upgrade since I just got Akashi. My question is, is it worth to spend those screws to upgrade my equipments for this event or should I just stick to daily upgrade? ThanksÂ <ac_metadata title="Need advice about using screws"> </ac_metadata>
