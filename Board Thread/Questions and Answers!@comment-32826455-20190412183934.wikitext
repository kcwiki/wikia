I've recently been trying to create a video showing a lot of fake gameplay footage but I have no idea where to get sprite assets for the various actions going on in a battle, ie: scouting phase, air battles, the decisions of whether to advance or withdraw, etc. While I've found a good amount of sprites on the wiki, it still doesn't contain all the ones I need. Where do I go?<ac_metadata title="Where can I go to get game assets not on the wiki?"> </ac_metadata>
