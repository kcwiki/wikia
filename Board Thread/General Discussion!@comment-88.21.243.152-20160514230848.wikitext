This is kinda bothering me, I stoped using refresh because I discovered I could get banned, but sometimes my internet just stop working and the game stops, I also sometimes fear to close it manually, like for turning the pc off or just stop using chrome, but I don't really know about this, thank you for your atenttion <ac_metadata title="Should I leave the game open or can I close it normally?" related_topics=""> </ac_metadata>
