Alright, so I decided to edit Central Princess's page to create a seperate tab for her Vita incarnation, just like Iowa. Trouble is, when I try to edit the info boxes in the Vita tab, they don't show up in the module editor. What do I do?<ac_metadata title="Central Princess page help"> </ac_metadata>
