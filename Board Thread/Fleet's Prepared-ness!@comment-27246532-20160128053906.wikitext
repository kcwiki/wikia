Hey everyone, I am fairly excited for the upcoming event!! I think I'll be able to complete it, I managed to clear the Fall Event last minute (literally). I'm currently at Level 90, and I've been playing since Winter 2015 (but the Spring 2015 event was my first event). I was lost in the game up until September, when I started to get on the right track and taking it seriously. With the right resources and a fair amount of buckets, I cleared the Fall Event with ease.

Ever since, I've been working on those EO's and remodelling ships. I'm fairly content with my resources, other than my bauxite and buckets (20/22/20/5k, 90 Buckets). As for expeditions, due to school and exams, I've been runnign 9/11/13 for a while now and I am happy with what I am getting. But if anyone has some suggestions, feel free to tell me about them.

As for my fleet, I feel like I have most of the essential Kai's/Kai Ni's achieved. There are some ships I'm levelling just for extra precaution (Most CA's,CV(L)'s and some DD's). But if any of you guys have any tips, I'd love to hear them.
