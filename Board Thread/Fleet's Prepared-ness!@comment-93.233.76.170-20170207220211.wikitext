Depending on drops and other rewards (medals, equipment) I might consider going all hard, but more likely E/M/H or M/M/M.

As I see it,

>400 buckets is fine, resources 90/85/97/69 okayish. CVs and BBs okayish, CA/CL/DD/SS fair (Kasumi next to Kai Ni), AV lacking, AS just bad (would not be surprised if it got a special role in this event...). Second-highest ship Katori at level 96 is another OASW capable ship.

Equipment is lacking in no real heavy guns, and no good radars (32/33).

For whatever reason the large bulge and T2 landing craft are not listed.

There are many trained lower quality carrier planes of all types.

I also have some untrained LBAS planes, but world 6 LBAS is not yet unlocked. Since this week I have Choukai Kai Ni, so I could work on that, but B41 - the two runs I tried indicate that it could become bucket and resource intensive to push that quest(line), but as you can see; I already sparkled the required ships...

In 1h the subs will return from exp. 30 and bring me a jet engine, but I am not willing to scrap three existing trained Shiden-K2 - so I would have to push crafting if I wanted a jet plane...



P.S. Nagato dropped today from 400/100/600/100 and thanks to some kind PvP TTKs is already level 11 (despite not being flagship and not "pushing" it to MVP), but yeah, she will be of little use in the event, just like the second Mutsu - maybe in E1 to avoid ship locking for the better ships :o)
