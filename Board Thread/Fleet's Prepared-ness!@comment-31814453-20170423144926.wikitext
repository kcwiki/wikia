Hi, This is my first event and i am not sure what to expect. So i am hq 95 and due to the rewards spike from easy to medium, i am not sure which level of difficulty my fleet is able to handle. I have about 4-5 ap shell all on my high lvls kai ni kongous and nagato. about 4 reppu( can get 1 more if i rush junyou) and 4 shiden kai. couple of ryuuseis and suisei. Any advice is appreciated. I apologize in advance due to the fleet image is being done in paint. I think i missed mogami, but shes kai-ed but at lvl 30[[File:2304myfleet.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Advice on Difficulty Recommendation for Spring 2017"> </ac_metadata>
