Last Europe event of August, 2017, I wanted to get Graf Zeppelin so tried E-7 boss node for 97 times. Unfortunately I failed and all of my resources were gone with it. What a terrible disaster...

Currently in E-3 of Leyte event was also quite same. I sortied multiple times to achieve Teruzuki but couldn't find her.

So I just wonder how many times do we have to try to get the shipgirls we want. What about your case, people? How many times did you tried to get your own most wanted shipgirl?<ac_metadata title="How many times did you sortied to get a single &quot;most wanted&quot; shipgirl?"> </ac_metadata>
