So the awful tragedy i mentioned earlier is a bad news, the news is about the remain of WW2 Ships in Java Sea is gone and from the title you may already know that these ships are from UK and Netherlands, so the ships are:

-Hr Ms Kortenaer (DD)

-Hr Ms Java (Cruiser, idk if it's CL or CA)

-Hr Ms De Ruyter (CL)

but in the news the ships from UK are not specified and only be written as 3 Ships (from the news there aren't any specified class) and 1 SS.

Again as an Indonesian TTK i'm very sorry for my idiotic countrymen's action as they don't value history and only set their eyes on one specific thing: Money

Note: yes those ships aren't related to Kancolle but still..... oh and if you want the news source just ask (why i don't post it now? it's in Indonesian and i'm afraid you guys don't want to see a long-ass pict with language you don't even know)<ac_metadata title="So this awful tragedy happened... (Sorry to all UK and Netherlands Teitoku out there in behalf of my idiot countrymen who did the Illegal Salvaging)"> </ac_metadata>
