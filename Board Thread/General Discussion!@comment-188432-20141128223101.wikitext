Hey guys :) 

Just wanted to drop by and congratulate you on doing such a great job with this wikia so far.  Your WAM score — that's a metric we use to determine the health of individual wikias — is super impressive.  Did you know that you're in the top 20 of English language gaming wikias?  

We can't help but notice, though, that you're still using pretty much default formatting.  If you want any help with creating a new wordmark (logo), adding a snazzy background, or coming up with any other improvements to the look and feel of the wikia, please let us know.  

Just stop by [[community:project:Community_Development_Team/Requests]], put in a request, and we'll help you out!  

You'll probably want to use this thread for discussing what it is you'd like to change about the wikia '''''before''''' you put in your request with us.  So feel free to start throwing ideas out about how you'd like the look of the wikia to change!<ac_metadata title="Wikia wants to help you out!" notify_everyone="1417213861"> </ac_metadata>
