I'm pretty much screwed here, after i press the game start button, it goes loading, and after a few seconds i get the cat error screen.

I already reconnected, cleared cache...

the console says "GET http://203.104.209.7/gadget/script/jquery.min.map 404 (Not Found)"

i guess that's the problem <_<

but i have no idea how to solve it, halp ?<ac_metadata title="cat error after game start"> </ac_metadata>
