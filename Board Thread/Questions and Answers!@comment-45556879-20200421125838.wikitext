I decided to pick up Kancolle again after a while and now I can't seem to get it to work in any way. I first got the "not available in your region" error and then after I tried the cookie hack and several stuff I always get a white screen where nothing loads no matter what. I've tried Poi, Kancolle Viewer and KC3Kai and I always end up getting the white screen. Is there any way I can fix this? Thank you.<ac_metadata title="Kancolle won&#039;t load no matter the extension/viewer I use"> </ac_metadata>
