Hi there :D I'm somehow doubting if my ships can pull off a Easy ModeÂ [[File:Low_level_ships.png|thumb|376px]]

Currently leveling those DD's and CL's to Kai before the event while stockpiling

Can I manage to pull off the Easy Mode maps? and try some Med Maps?

Kinda doubting since this is my first event :)

Thanks for the advice<ac_metadata title="Please in need of advice (First Event)"> </ac_metadata>
