[[File:Early_juillet.jpg|thumb|Fleet as of early July]]Alright, this is my fleet at the moment. I did the last two events with various difficulties (Like E-1-2 Medium, E-3-4 Hard and E-5-6 Easy) because I didn't want to ty hard and was happy enough with the rewards and the post-farming (Ooyodo, Amatsukaze, Unryuu). But on the next one, I'm planning to go for the First Class Medal.

I wanted to know where I lack off with this fleet. I'm levelling Suzuya right know, along with Shoukaku and Zuikaku. I may want to powerlevel another CLT, if I found a second KTKM (and don't forget to lock her before using her as modernization stuff). Every girl being at least lvl 60 is fully modernized. Also, I'm pretty decent with all my equipments (except mayb forthe fighter, I have 1 Reppuu and 2 Reppuu 601, the rest are 2 Type 21 Skilled and some Shinden Kai Ni).

For a more detailled view on my equipements, I got enough red cannon of all caliber (20.3(n°2), 41cm, 46cm, but also the prototypes and special from kai ni), got enough yellow canons too, a few Quint, some good planes from last events and the high-end CVs, Some Saiun and Type 2 Recon, a few special Zuiuns, a Type 32, Type 33, Type 22 Kai, good enough ASW gear, few planes from multiple Akitsu Maru Kai, 6 Type 3 Shell, 5 AP Shell, Night Gears, Fleet Command Facility, WG42, SCAMP, and the AACI stuff from Maya and Akizuki (didn't started upgrading the stuff using Akashi, I just dropped it during thi month's 2-5). I wanted to get that big Searchlight, but it was mainly for the sake of collection.

What is your opinion on what I should focus on, if there is anything to focus on ?

PS : I already used this month's BP for Bismarck drei, which is awesome btw, so I won't have another one before August, if I find the will to do the first four X-5 maps before the event.

PS2 : Here the link for my fleet, it doesn't seem to load properly here : http://i.imgur.com/7KIJ4nN.jpg

PS3 : Also, i'm currently at ~500 buckets and ~20k everything, and heavily farming 5-4 for leveling and in search of Uzuki (damned missing DD for a whole bunch of quests ...). I running expeditions 2, 3 and 5 all day, as I heard there were basically the best one, but I'm not sure which one I should do in preparation of the event, and when to stop the farming and begin the stacking, if I want to go all the way in hard.<ac_metadata title="Fleet for Hard difficulty - Would like some advice"> </ac_metadata>
