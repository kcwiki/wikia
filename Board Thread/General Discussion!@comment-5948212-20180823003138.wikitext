Soo, I was playing back in end July and early August some "heavy" games like Deus Ex Mankind divided, The Witcher 3 and "light" VNs, all with Kancolle in the background.

<br />Now, came back to waste time with these games and Phase II and started to have insane frame drops and GPU temperature spike. I thought, "shit! My GPU is dying". Went back to normal after a good minute. Happened again, BUT managed to alt-tab and check the open tasks in order to confirm if my GPU, CPU, SSD/HDD or power source is having issues. And now I point that google chrome is SOMEFUCKINGHOW using 100% of GPU out of nowhere for a long period of time. Is anyone having problems related to this? The only different aspect from before is Phase II, and I read that users were having problem with cache/memory usage, that is under "fixing". But to make the GPU scream? What the hell.

Again, can anyone relate to this? Someone also having this problem? I'm worried, this is 100% not healthy for any RIG component.<br />Update: cleaned cache and the problem persists... What the hell.

Update 2: This is also happening with my notebook, a simple one that plays VNs... And is having the same issue while running KC3 and Phase II in the background.<ac_metadata title="100% GPU usage from &quot;Google Chrome&quot; task, Kancolle latest update related somehow?"> </ac_metadata>
