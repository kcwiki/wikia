I already have an account, but want to start over w/ a new one. However, I've heard that you can get banned for having multiple accounts. I will not use the old account anymore in case I do manage to get a new one (thinking about giving it to my sister or disabling, if possible), but I don't know if that counts or not and am afraid of the ban. I connect via VPN generally, but when it doesn't work or starts lagging too much I use KC3. Anyone here knows if that would be safe? :/ 

Thanks!<ac_metadata title="I already have an account, but can I create a new one without getting banned?"> </ac_metadata>
