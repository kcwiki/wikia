I have been playing for a while now though not very actively, but after getting rekted by Summer 2015 Event I decided to pour more time into KC. Â And soon enough, I am confronted by the question of who to give my BP to.

As of current, I only have 1 BP and can only get 2 medels/month from 1-5 and 2-5 (working on getting through 3 & 4)

As I don't want to repeatly trouble the community with same question over and over again over the next few months, what is the general concensus for the''' order of importance/ Priority for giving BPs''' to? Or should I just ask everytime I have a BP?

Hopefully I am not asking too much, Thanks in advance!<ac_metadata title="Needing advice with Blueprint(s)"> </ac_metadata>
