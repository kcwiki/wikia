So, Spring '16 will be my second event and I did a lot of stuff to prepare, but after the announcement that it'll be "Construction of an Air Base" I'm not that confident. Well, I have only one decent-levelled CV after all. So what else am I lacking? What ships to level in the future? Should I prepare an anti-air DD (I have only Hatsuzuki thou)? Thanks in advance.
