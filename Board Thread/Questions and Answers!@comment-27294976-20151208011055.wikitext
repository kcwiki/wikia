Hello, I'm a rather new player and was wondering about the seasonal item's (BGM, furniture. and voice's) and how ti get the furniture for the season's and the BGM's. Sorry if this is somewhere else on here, I'm just a bit confused with it.<ac_metadata title="Seasonal thing&#039;s etc. in general?"> </ac_metadata>
