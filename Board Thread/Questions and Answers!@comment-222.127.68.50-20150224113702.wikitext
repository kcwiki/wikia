I recently switched from using Flash Projector to KCV for reasons. Ever since i used KCV, I keep getting random DCs after long loading times and also get randomly DC just be being idle. I'm pretty sure my net is stable and fast. I never had these issues back in using Flash. Is this normal? since i feel like i might get banned for having a lot of refresh times per day just because of this issue.<ac_metadata title="KCV random DCs"> </ac_metadata>
