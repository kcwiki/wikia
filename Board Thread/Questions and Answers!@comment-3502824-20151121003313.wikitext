Just out of curiosity and for sake of gathering information for other players:

===Has anyone who has [[Prinz Eugen]] from either Fall 2014 last year or from recent drop in node M were able to obtain a "2ND COPY"?===

====Please let me know as I do not want people to waste their time farming node M if a 2nd copy is not available.====

Thanks.<ac_metadata title="[Fall 2015] Prinz Eugen &quot;2nd Copy&quot; Drop Confirmation Required" related_topics="Fall 2015 Event"> </ac_metadata>
