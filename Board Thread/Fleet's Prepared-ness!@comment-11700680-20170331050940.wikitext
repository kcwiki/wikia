[[File:Ships_3-31-17.png|thumb]][[File:Equipment_3-31-17.png|thumb]]When the next update is finished, I intend to devote a large ammount of time to leveling my ships and gathering equipment for the next event. My goal for the event is mostly easy, going for medium or hard if the map is easy/has good rewards.

My resources are at: 32000 Fuel, 42000 Ammo, 30000 Steel, 16000 Bauxite, and 171 Buckets.

I will be getting a blueprint during April.

What should I focus on leveling/getting? Or should I just focus on stockpiling resources until the event?<ac_metadata title="Preparation for next event."> </ac_metadata>
