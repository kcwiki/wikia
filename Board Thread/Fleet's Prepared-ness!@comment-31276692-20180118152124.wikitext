Well, I am preparing for upcoming Winter Event. I am leveling Naganami to Kai Ni, also, I am planning to level my Michishio and Murasame to their kai ni's. Resources are 93/92/98/44k + 550 bucket. My aim is finishing the whole event and farming Hatsuzuki. I just want her so much. Probably I will go for easy mode. So what you guys think about my fleet? If you can help me I will be much appreciated. Btw I got 1 blueprint and 1 Action Report. I can get 1 more BP until event.[[File:Aasdasdasdasdasdasasdas.jpg|thumb|Ships..]][[File:Asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdadasdasdas.jpg|thumb|Equipment]][[File:Cççççççççççççççççççççççç.jpg|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="How is my fleet?
