125k Fuel, 123k Ammo, 85k Steel, 33k Bauxite, 440 Buckets. Currently sitting on 1 BP and 3 medals, have done all EOs up to 4-5 for this month (5-5 not unlocked yet). I have one prototype flight deck available.

I do not have an Akashi, so no upgraded equips are available. No FCF either due to not having Ooyodo yet. My BP plan is to obtain a medal from one of the event maps and pump Bismarck to Drei straight, assuming nothing forces me to K2 Shoukaku first.

Is is possible to aim for all hard? Or should I still stick to medium mixed with some hard clears?<ac_metadata title="Second Event, Aiming for Medium Clear"> </ac_metadata>
