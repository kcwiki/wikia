I will likely have both Iwai and Iwamoto next month and planning to k2 Suzuya on my next BP.Am currently leveling both Fumizuki & Kawakaze to k2 and lvling both shimakaze and yukikaze to around 70 and get Libeccio to have enough stats for oasw.

In terms of equipment i know i got a lot of useless upgrades i did because i have no idea what am doing back then and after i got two max m21 am going to max my type 91 AP and proto 35.6 cm and get my proto 41 to highest as possible because i lack 41 cm guns in me so it depends how many mutsu i can get on my 3-3 runs.<ac_metadata title="How&#039;s my fleet?"> </ac_metadata>
