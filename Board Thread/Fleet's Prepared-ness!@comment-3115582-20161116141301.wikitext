Wunderschönen guten Tag, ladies and gentlemen. I pretty much ignored Spring 2016 Event and only farmed myself two cups of Pudding during the Summer 2016 Event, so I've got loads of ressources and buckets to waste (let's see what is left of that after 4-5). The big question is, what difficulty should I go for (disregarding the fact we know pretty much nothing about the maps to come)? Though I'm still lacking some handy ships like Ooyodo, the Akizuki-class or Akitsu Maru, my fleet itself might be somewhat okay-ish for medium, but I think I'm ''severely'' lacking in the equipment department, especially regarding my Reppuu and Shiden K2 (20/60/10/112 keeps throwing Saiun and useless trash at me). On another note: I have 3 blueprints, but at least 8 Ships to possibly spend them on (Bismarck, Chikuma, Fusou, Yamashiro, Ooshio, Kinu and the Shoukaku sisters [I don't have the flight decks yet]). Any recommendations in light of the upcoming event?

Without further ado, here's some of my stuff.
