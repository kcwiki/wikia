Hello,

i noticed today, that successfully completing expedition 2 won't increase my bucket count. A friend of mine noticed the same thing.

I tried restarting the game between expeditions etc but no buckets for me :(

Do you know, why we can't generate any buckets at the moment?



Thanks<ac_metadata title="No Buckets from expeditions"> </ac_metadata>
