Maybe I am not getting the correct understanding of the editor, but well:




When I try to edit the box (table) in the top-right corner of such a page, it does not show up after clicking "edit".

For example: https://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Sagiri

I tried to add world 7-1 as a place to drop, but I could not find the position for this data in edit-mode. As if the code for this box is filtered.

Is this a bug? Can it be helped somehow?

I noticed outdated data for a few other shipgirls as well, but I am having the same issue at their pages.<ac_metadata title="Edit shipgirl pages not completly possible?"> </ac_metadata>
