[[File:Pic.png|thumb|Just the showcase, not seen are a few more DDs, CLs, CAs, etc.]][[File:Pic2.png|thumb|Equip list, I know I need more Reppuu, Ryuusei, etc.]]Attached are my current showcase, and gear.Â 

RSC/Consumables:

Buckets:620

Fuel: 257k

Ammo:175k

Steel: 123k

Baux(I know it's low): 30k T_T

I know I need better aircraft, radar, etc, but I am not sure what difficulty I could do. I kind of want to sleaze through on easy and prepare for the summer event but at the same time do this on whatever difficulty I can get to.

Any feedback is appreciated. I may be a level 100 TTK with a married Graf, but I still have my doubts. (Couldn't clear summer 2015 because I was new, but I still got Kawakaze!)<ac_metadata title="Not sure where to start improving..."> </ac_metadata>
