* Computed by comparing before and after E-1 resource screenshots
* '''SPECIFY IF YOUR GUESS IS POSITIVE (GAIN) OR NEGATIVE (LOSS)'''
** Unsigned entries will be considered '''Negative (Loss)'''
** Yes, it could also be a gain / positive number. See [[User_blog:Dragonjet/Dragonjet%27s_Summer_2014_Event_Battle_Log|Summer 2014 battle log]]
** I do not rush my maps, so regen and exped is also a factor
** Note: On Summer 2014, my ammo increased by '''+1,294'''
