I back to play since left for 3-4 weeks. Everything works just fine but repair docks.

I get <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;line-height:14px;">{{CatBomb}} every time I try and </span>cannot access it anymore.

I try troubleshooting by clear cache, cookies, reset internet connection (modem and router) even try to play in incognito mode but none of these works or fix this issues.

I cannot create ticket to DMM because I cannot write Japanese. What can I do?<ac_metadata title="Got cat bombed when I try to get in repair dock..."> </ac_metadata>
