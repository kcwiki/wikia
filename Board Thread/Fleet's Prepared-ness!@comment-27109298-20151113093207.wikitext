[[File:Kanmusuyo.png|thumb|400px|da girlz pt 1]][[File:Kanmusu2.png|thumb|400px]]I asked for advice before so I am familiar with what to do (more or less), however, with the event a little under a week away I just wanted to ask am I ready? Since I am still a TTK who hasn't tackled an event yet, I am going for easy. MY MAIN GOAL IS TO SNAG ME A AKIZKUKI, clearing the event is second. 

Side notes: I have a blueprint, and am working on Ayanami (Lv 19) for my 6th Destroyer for the event. Also Maya and ABKM. 

'''TL;DR '''I want an Akizuki from the event. What do I do? 

Thank you for taking time out of your event preparations!<ac_metadata title="A little under a week left! Just some quick tips/guidance. ( ́ ◕◞ε◟◕`)"> </ac_metadata>
