Like I said, before starting our doujin, there is quite a lot of problem to cover

1. The artist: The one who volunteer to draw will need to promise to do it usually. If the ones who draw quit in progress, it won't be nice, will it? So we need one who can volunteer and can stick till the very end of each chapter. Like I said before in the suggestion page, he/she who draw can't be in the doujin itself because too much charater will mess up the story. I have been trying to talk to Gensui on the chat but he have been on sortie so I can't talk to him yet.

2. The story: How to start the doujin itself is quite hard. My story's first chapter planned will be about me, who is entering the naval district will experienced TTKs, other chapter will be other's TTK story. I belive that some people won't be happy because I don't do the drawing, only the planing yet get to be the MC in the first chapter. So yeah, I think the story still have some problem to be deal with

So I need help on these problem, after these problem have been solve, we can work one the doujin
