Is it normal? Any way to "fix this"? Is it always been consuming my Desktop's life span? Or it's harmless?
I think it's pretty much outrageous for a browser game to be using more or as much "energy" than 3-A games or good looking indie-multiplayer games.

I just noticed now that I finally updated Windows10. I went 4 months without using my desktop. (of course, I imagine this also happens in laptop...)
