I changed from Windows to Linux Mint recently, and when I started Kancolle, everything loaded perfectly except for the girls themselves. All of them. I even left them for a few hours and their images still hasn't loaded.

Is there any way to fix this? Thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="Kanmusu pictures not loading. Help?"> </ac_metadata>
