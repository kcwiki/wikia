I intend to do entirely Easy on the event except if a map turns out to be really easy.

I currently have 44k fuel, 33k ammo, 41k steel, 29k bauxite, and 117 buckets.

Should I do daily/weekly quests? If so, which should I avoid?

Are there any ships I should absolutely get ready for the event? Or should I prioritise stockpiling resources?[[File:Ship_List_2017-07-09.jpg|thumb|I managed to clear all but E-3 on normal last event.]][[File:Equipment_List_2017-07-09.jpg|thumb|I don't have the best of luck with RNG, so please dont suggest a million things for me to get.]]<ac_metadata title="Looking for advice on what to do until the event."> </ac_metadata>
