This will be my second event, and although I managed to clear the previous one mostly on hard, this will be my first large-scale event, so I would like to know how prepared I am.

Almost everything is pretty much maxed on modernization. I feel that I'm lacking in CVs as I've never gotten Shoukaku and Zuikaku, and Katsuragi and Unryuu still don't seem ready for combat. I'm currently training Ashigara to get to kai ni with 3-2 grinding, along with Fusou, Chikuma, Chitose, and Chiyoda. I have 2 medals atm and am planning on getting 2 asap next month for Chikuma's K2. I'm not sure if I have enough reppuu, so should I use 20/10/60/100 for daily crafting and hope to get more? Any more advice would be appreciated, and thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="Looking to clear hard, would like some advice please"> </ac_metadata>
