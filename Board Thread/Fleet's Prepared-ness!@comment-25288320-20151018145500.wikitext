Hi, everyone. I want to know that I aim for clearing hard final maps is possible? I would maybe run all easy then 2 last maps are medium and hard. And maybe a little bit of farming ship (Possibly U-chan) I'm now farming resource and leveling bismarck (having only 1 blueprint and cleared all EO except 1-6 and 5-5) btw I have all CLT (all kai ni 80-90)
