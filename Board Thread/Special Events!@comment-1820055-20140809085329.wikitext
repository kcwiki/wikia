This is an attempt to gather all reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-3</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Summer 2014 Event]] comments. Only reports please. Non-report comments will be removed.

It is advised to include these information:
* HQ Level
* Total LoS
* Route - the nodes or the direction your fleet went
* Fleet Composition
** Better if including equips so we can check equipment LoS
** Better if including ship levels so we can see base LoS
* Screenshots are ok

Posting of enemy encounters are fine too, as long as they are included in a report where it mentions what node it's from.<ac_metadata title="[Summer 2014 Event] Reports: E-3" related_topics="Summer 2014 Event"> </ac_metadata>
