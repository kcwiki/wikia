For the last three days I've been encountering catbombs when I go on sortie, return from sortie, click on the home screen to get Expedition results or return to the home screen from any of the other screens like repair docks or fleet selection.

At first I thought it was just the server being busy or work with the EOs being prepared but it keeps happening. When I log in, the game works fine for a few minutes and then starts to act up with the console filling with errors like these which eventually leads to the catbomb:

Another strange occurence is battle voices from previous sorties playing out of nowhere.

I've tried clearing the cache and installing Adobe Flash instead of using the built-in Chrome version, and tried muting the game and disabling the voices but it keeps happening. Is this a problem with the game or is there something I need to do to fix it? Thank you for any assistance.<ac_metadata title="Game freezes and then catbombs"> </ac_metadata>
