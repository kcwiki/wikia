Hello everyone, here I put them a photo-capture my fleet and weapons grateful if I had an opinion for the next event; I started playing in March of this year but I'm not very good with the strategies I have much to learn; in the event of summer I lost my Junyou lvl 85 and I was very sad, I do not want to repeat that.

sry for my bad english
