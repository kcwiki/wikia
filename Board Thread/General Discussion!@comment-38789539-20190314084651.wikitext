how long will this game last what do you think? as new player is it worthy to invest time/money in it? i ask because grim dawn new addon hits later this month so i cant decide - to continue with kancolle or drop it forever and return back to GD lol ))) this kancolle business eats lots of free time but progress is so slow. all these medals blueprints action reports take too long to obtain... so what do you think? will servers still be up in, say, 2-3 years? ))<ac_metadata title="how long?"> </ac_metadata>
