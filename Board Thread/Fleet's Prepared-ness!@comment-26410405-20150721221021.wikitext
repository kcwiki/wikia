Hi all!

Please check out the ships I prepared for the event and tell me on which difficulty can I hope to clear it. My goal is to clear it on medium (possibly with first two maps on hard, though I'm not sure). But I also need some rare ship girls I'm planning to farm for if they'll be droppable, so should I go for EO maps on easy?

Anyway, here are my ships (all had equipment removed to show raw stats):

[[File:Cvdiv1.jpg|thumb|left|Carrier Division 1]][[File:Cvdiv2.jpg|thumb|Carrier Division 2]]









[[File:Bbdiv1.jpg|thumb|left|Battleship Division 1 (fast)]][[File:Bbdiv2.jpg|thumb|Battleship Division 2 (slow)]][[File:Crudiv1.jpg|thumb|left|Cruiser Division 1]][[File:Crudiv2.jpg|thumb|Cruiser Division 2]][[File:Desron1.jpg|thumb|left|Destroyer Squadron 1]][[File:Desron2.jpg|thumb|Destroyer Squadron 2 (and a sub if I need her)]]





























These are my highest levelled ships (except two more subs at 50+). I also have Akashi at level 51, but she'll be on repair duty.

As for equipments I have:

Planes: 4 Reppu, 1 Shiden K2, 1 Type 52 Zero (601st), 1 Type 62 Zero FB, 4 Suisei 12A, 2 Ryuusei, 4 Ryuusei Kai, 1 Tenzan (601st), 1 Ryuusei (601st), 2 Saiun, 1 Type 2 Recon, 2 Zuiun (634th), 1 Type 98 Recon (Night Scout)

Guns: 2 35.6cm Twin Mount (Dazzle), 1 Proto 35.6cm Triple Mount, 10 20.3cm(no.2) Twin Mount, 2 15.2cm Twin Mount, 1 12.7cm Twin Mount Type B (+3), 2 12.7cm Twin HA Mount (Late)

Anti-Air: 1 Type 94 AAFD (+9) ''- soon to be upgraded to 12.7cm HA+FD, ''1 Type 91 AAFD (+3), 1 25mm Triple Mount (CD), 1 10cm Twin HA Carriage Mount, 3x 12cm Rocket Launchers

Torpedoes: 2 61cm Quint Oxygen, 4 Type A Ko-hyoteki

Radars: 2 Type 32, 1 Type 33, 1 Type 14, 1 Type 13 Kai, 1 Type 22 Kai 4, many Type 22 and Type 21

Engines: 1 Enhanced Steam, 1 High Pressure Steam

Ammo: 7 Type 3 shells, 7 Type 91 AP shells

Various: 1 Searchlight, 1 Star Shell, 1 Fleet Command Facility, also 13 damecons

My resources are as you can see in the screenshots. I still need to solve the fuel/ammo shortage and hopefully stock up as much as I currently have steel/baux. So I can't be grinding much anymore, especially since I started working in July (my schedule is 4 days work 4 days off), though I could probably get all Kongou's to Kai Ni since they are closest. I could try grinding Souryuu and Hiryuu to Kai Ni, but I'm afraid I won't have time to stock up on fuel/ammo in that case. Same with destroyers like Fubuki.

So, what would you think I still need to do, besides getting more resources, to be more ready for clearing Summer Event on medium (considering my limited gameplay time)?

Thank you in advance!<ac_metadata title="Is this fleet good enough for Medium?"> </ac_metadata>
