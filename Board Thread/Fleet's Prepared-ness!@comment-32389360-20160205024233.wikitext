<p style="font-weight:normal;">Hi this is the second event of Kancolle I'm participating in. Last time I only got to E-4, then I went Prinz farming (couldn't get her) and couldn't complete E-5 due to the lack of resources I managed to pick up. Also, I have a doubt about farming foreign ships, is it necessary to complete quest D8 to access foreign ships.</p>
