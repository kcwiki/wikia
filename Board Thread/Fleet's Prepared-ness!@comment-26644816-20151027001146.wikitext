So I'm thinking on joining this event. It's my second event but i didn't pass completely Summer event ( I was stuck in E-3, then i gave up and grind for Ooyodo and Tokitsukaze

My fleet is currently under levelling. I'm trying to Kai Ni Murakumo and then i will go for the Sendai Sisters Kai Ni, then i will kai Ooyodo for the fleet facilty.

Any suggestions if i should level more shipgirls and try to join in event?

My resources currently are:

10877 Fuel   11755 Ammo  

11628 Steel    12541 Bauxite

And 92 buckets and counting
