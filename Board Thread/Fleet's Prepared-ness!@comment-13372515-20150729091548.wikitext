Hello. This is goint to be the first event I actually get to participate in. My HQ is lvl 73. Here is my [http://i.imgur.com/MS7ZMQS.png?1 resource counter] and this is what my [http://i.imgur.com/IA8Ukgf.png fleet looks like]. From the better equips I have one of both Type 32 Surface and Type 14 Air Radars, 2 Type 3 Shells and one 91 AP, 1 Shiden Kai2, 2 Reppuu, 1 Ryuusei Kai and 3 46cm Triple Mounts.

What I'd like to know is which difficulty setting I should choose and what I should do to make my fleet better. Thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="My fleet, advice welcome."> </ac_metadata>
