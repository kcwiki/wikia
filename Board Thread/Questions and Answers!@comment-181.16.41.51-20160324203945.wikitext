I somewhat recently joined the game and things were working perfectly fine so far. Since there are holidays in my home country right now I went on a vacation to Argentina. I took a crappy laptop with me hoping I would be able to play the game over here to at least do my expeditions once a day and do the improvement daily.

But I absolutely cannot play the game here. I immediately get the error cat page after logging in. I tried logging in with the browser without any tools, with KCV, with KC3 and even through a proxy (Ooi). In all 4 cases I immediately get the error cat.

Do people get disconnected from the game when their internet speed is too low? I am using Wifi and get a little less than 1 mbit. Or is there anything else that is preventing me from playing the game? Do I have any other options than what I already tried to play the game?<ac_metadata title="KanColle in Argentina"> </ac_metadata>
