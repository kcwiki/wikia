[[File:Winter_2018_ShipList_2018-01-14.jpg|thumb]]I plan on doing this event on mostly medium, dropping to easy only if a map is impossible, and at most doing 1-2 maps on hard if the rewards are worth the suffering. I'm probably not going to need ALL of these ships leveled to a usable level, so which ones should I focus on?

A numbered thing would be nice, like 1 being "ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE" and 4 being "only get this if you have everything else done and have spare time".

Thanks in advance!<ac_metadata title="Prep for winter 2018."> </ac_metadata>
