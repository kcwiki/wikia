Hi guys! So '''[[Winter 2015 Event]] is coming next week'''!

To further facilitate analysis, we have a new reporting mechanism on the wikia. Just use the following template and reply to the specific map thread, and it will automatically compile all your results.

This is a feature fresh from the oven, so we need to taste it first before putting onto the dinner table, so '''please post test reports'''. Any route and composition can do, but please also try to pattern other people's route and compo so we can also test high counts. We don't want all reports go 1 1 1 1 1 :P

{{Fleet

|Ship2 = (2)46cm / recon plane / sanshiki
|Ship3 = reppu kai / (2)reppu / saiun
|Ship4 = (2)20cm[2] / zuiun / zuiun
|Ship5 = (2)20cm[2] / zuiun / zuiun
|Ship6 = (2)10cm THA / t13 radar
