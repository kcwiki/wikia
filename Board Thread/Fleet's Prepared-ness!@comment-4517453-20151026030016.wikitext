So right now I believe I can do some of Easy, maybe more? Anyway how should I be focusing my time, leveling ships or focusing on orel cruising, and right now I am at 14000/20000/14000/14000 in supplies. I'm at 72 HQ Lv as of right now. Any help would be appreciated[[File:Ss_(2015-10-25_at_10.49.33).png|thumb|Ships]]

'''Ships''': I don't know if I should be doing 1-5 or 3-2A farming right now, I'm pretty close on getting Fubiki and Hibiki to Kai2 and in the proccess of leveling Shimakaze and Yukikaze though they are a bit behind since I just got them. While the only high level CA I have is Maya, and for BB I have Kongou and Yamashiro pretty high levels while the rest are sitting near just kai.[[File:Ss_(2015-10-25_at_10.50.38).png|thumb]]






'''Equipment: '''My equipment right now isn't terrible right now but it could be better. I have gotten lucky and got a couple of Reppuu and I am not really sure what I should go for next in daily building.<ac_metadata title="Which Difficulty and where to go from here?"> </ac_metadata>
