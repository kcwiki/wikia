Soooooo about 10 days ago I posted a thread asking about if I was ready for the event and the results were... well, I was pretty screwwwed~ (^▽^;)

So now that 10 days have past and even tho I didn't super grind like crazy, I did do a bit to raise my fleet's levels, soooo now I would like to know if I'm heading in the right direction, and if I require some more of a certain type of ship to be leveled~ (´･ω･`)

Here's a Link to the Previous Post~ : http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:281289

Here goes a second wall of text.....



[ '''HQ''': 91 ] [ '''Buckets''': 506 ] [ '''Dev Mats''': 511 ]

[ '''Fuel''': 60k ] [ '''Ammo''': 45k ] [ '''Steel''': 46k ] [ '''Baux''': 24k ]

(Baux Decreased (*￣m￣) How do I farm Baux?)



'''Ships''': Again, for the sake of simplicity, I'll be namming ships that are '''level 25+'''



'''DD:''' Largely unchanged, Shigure has reached K2, other than that, every other increase was really minor.

[Верный 73] [Yuudachi K2 66] [Shigure K2 60] [Hamakaze K 48] [Fubuki K 45] [Kagero K 34] [Shiranui K 34] [Murasame K 29] [Hatsuharu K 29] [Kasumi K 28] [Inazuma K 27] [Mutsiki K 27] [Kisaragi K 27] [Hatsushimo K 26]

(Got lazy changing DD's levels, probably only increased in 1 anyways~)

'''CL''': Also largely unchanged, except now Kiso is on her journey to K2~

[Jintsuu K2 66] [Sendai K2 62] [Kiso K 40] [Kuma K 35] [Tenryuu K 32] [Tatsuta K 27] [Naka K 25]

'''CLT:''' KTKM and Ooi has finally made it to K2~ ＼(^o^)／

[Kitakami K2 51] [Ooi K2 50]

'''CA''': [Furutaka K 52] [Chikuma K 48] [Atago K 31] [Maya K 29] [Nachi K 25]

Also largely unchanged because....

'''CAV''': Tone has joined the CAV class~~ (°∀°*)

[Tone K2 70] [Mogami K 32]                        Still kinda empty...（￣□￣；）

'''CVL''': Welcome Hiyou and Ryuujou into my fleets~ tho I feel I still require more CVLs..

[Junyou K 55] [Hiyou K 54] [Ryuujou K 50]

Chiyoda is currently in my Grinding fleet so I can get her to CVL soon, tho she's currently only level 19.....

'''CV''': With the exception of Hiryuu and Souryuu being in the "Grind to 50" Fleet, most CVs remain untouched.

[Kaga K 67] [Akagi K 61] [Hiryuu K 41] [Zuikaku K 38] [Souryuu K 36]

'''(F)BB(V)''': Didn't even touch any BBs..... Well... Maybe just a few...(＠_＠;)

[Haruna K2 117] [Hiei K2 77] [Kongou K 73] [Kirishima K 53] [Yamashiro K 53] [Mutsu K 42] [Fusou K 40]

'''SS''': ......................................... No comment... I still didn't use SS often cause I found out I can just insta kill 3-2A with mass Torpedoe bombers.. (ーー゛)

[ I-168 22] [I-8 22] [I-58 16] [Maruyu 6]



And now Equipments..................(TT▽TT)



'''''Aircrafts'''''

'''Fighter''': [Reppuu.......... RNGsus have mercy on mee (TT▽TT) (None)] [Type 52 lots] [Type 21 Lots]

'''Torpedoe''': [Ryuusei Kai 2] [Tenzan 2]

'''Bomber''': [Suisei 5]

'''Others''': [Saiun 1]

And a crap tone of basic aircrafts.




'''''ASW'''''

'''Sonar''': [Type 93 7]

'''Depth Charge''': [Type 94 3]




'''''Radar'''''

'''Air''': [Type 13 1] [Type 21 7]

'''Surface''': [Type 22 1]




'''''Shells''''':

'''AP''': [Type 91 2]

'''Type 3''': 3




'''Night Equipments'''

'''Searchlight: '''2

'''Starshell: '''1

'''Night Scout: '''1



This is literally a '''"Copy and Paste"''' from the last Thread becuse I have been too focused on '''crafting Reppus''' to care about other equipments, so yes, I understand I still '''lack a few''' '''Sonars, Depth Charges, AP Shells/Type3. '''But for some god forbidden reason, I still cannot get any Reppus or Shiden Kai II !!

WAI YOU DO THIS TO ME RNGSUS!!! (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻

I cri everi teim....... (TT▽TT)



But other than my depressing luck on equipments, (which I'll continue trying), how is my fleet doing right now? Is there any certain things I need to quickly do before it's too late for me? Like any ships I should concider '''leveling/prioritise leveling''', or am I in the safe zone now? (which I don't really think so, that's why I'm here xD)

All help and advice would be highly apreciated~

Thankies~~ φ(・∀・＊)



'''EDIT:''' Oh yes I don't think I've added this in my last thread at all, this is my first event on Kancolle~ (´･ω･`)

Kinda....... since I did clear E-1 of last event, but I had no idea it was the event map since I started halfway through the event, it wasn't until the last few days that my friend told me there was an event happening ....(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻<ac_metadata title="UPDATE! Am I now ready for the upcoming event? （;　ﾟ Дﾟ）"> </ac_metadata>
