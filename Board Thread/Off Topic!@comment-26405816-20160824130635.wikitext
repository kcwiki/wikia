So I was thinking, are there any players that know and even play KanColle from Romania? I tried searching people but I always failed, so recently I made a group on Facebook that is focused on this topic. There are currently 2 members (me and one of my friends) and I want to find as many as possible, so if you happen to be a Romanian player please comment here, it'll be appreciated.

Also, if you are interested, here is the link of the group to send a request immediately: https://www.facebook.com/groups/501880329998277
