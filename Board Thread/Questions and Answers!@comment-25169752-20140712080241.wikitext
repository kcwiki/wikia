So basically, I've done the lottery 12 times now and no luck at all getting in.... am I doing something wrong? Clear cache, reload every 5 minutes. 12 lotteries seems like a lot to me, or it's maybe just that I have very bad luck..

Should I create another DMM account to try at a different account? Also, do I have to attend consecutive lotteries in order to get a higher chance at the next lottery?<ac_metadata title="How long does it take to get past the lottery selection?"> </ac_metadata>
