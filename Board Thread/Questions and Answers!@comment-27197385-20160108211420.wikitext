I have two blueprints sitting around and I'm wondering which two ships I should be using them on. Some of them still need to be trained, but my current main candidates are Zuikaku (93), Fusou (80), Shoukaku (76), Tone (52) and Abukuma (41).

Extra things to consider: I've kai-ni-ed Chikuma and Yamashiro, I have both proto catapults for the crane sisters, I don't have Taihou as an armored carrier.

Should I go ahead and give the two blueprints to Zuikaku and Fusou, who have reached their kai ni levels, or should I grind anyone else and wait to give the blueprint to them first? I'd be thankful for any advice!<ac_metadata title="Next ship to blueprint?"> </ac_metadata>
