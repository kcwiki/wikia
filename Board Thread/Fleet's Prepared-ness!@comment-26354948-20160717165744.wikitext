For basic equipment requirements, I think I have it covered, except the special plane drops from event. I only have 2 land base only since I only managed to clear til E-4 last event. I had no time and was underprepared in terms of resource and buckets. Chose to spend my free time farming for Yuu and Teruzuki.
