Hi. I'm a new admiral. and got stock in a trouble. I currently unlocked all the extra fleets but somehow along the way I keep getting a resources shortage while grinding. 

Currently Level 52. and I can't pass my soft cap limit eventhough I'm sending 3 of my fleets in a expedition.

I'm running the 5,9,21 expedition for fuel and ammo currently unlocking the 16-18 expedition. any tips for me?

I'm Currently grinding Souryuu and Kongou Sisters, Mutsu and Nagato. <ac_metadata title="[Help] Resources Shortage"> </ac_metadata>
