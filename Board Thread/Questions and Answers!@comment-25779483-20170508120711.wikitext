Hey, new to this board so i dunno if this is asked a lot, but i resupplied my CV and her planes are still few, like in her third slot which is supposed to be 46, but when i resupplied her it's around 13.. and in KC3 the number is orange... Can't resupply her either, the button is greyed out..<ac_metadata title="Resupplied but still less planes?"> </ac_metadata>
