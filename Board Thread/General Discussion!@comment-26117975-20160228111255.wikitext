i will cut to the chase....

1. my problem is sometimes i have a hard time to enter kancolle games especia[[File:Screenshot_(1485).png|thumb|usually a white sheet will appear to direct me to the buying page but there's no white sheet only lag]]lly if i'mÂ  to open it from a DMM page

2. It seems i cann't buy a DMM points, i cann't enter a buying page directly from the game so i'm using a button which locate on the side of point information...but when i'm enter the buying page and after click on the yellow button to confirm it. It's turn to be a blank page and it's seems i failed to buy it...

i have a hunch if the cause is our ISP (telkom / speedy) by chance but is it [[File:Screenshot_(1485)_-_Copy.png|thumb|i'm using the right button to go to the buying page]]true??i want a '''confirmation''' from you guys and oh, i'm buying DMM point using credit card method..thanks in advance...
