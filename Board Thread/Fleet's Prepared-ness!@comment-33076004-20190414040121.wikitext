I also have 2 BPs for ships that needed them and I have several that do but I was holding off to see what would be better for event (note: I do nit have flight deck for Shoukaku as I dont have her sister ship to get down the quest line rip me). I also have 3 Reinforcement Expansion I have not used on any ship. My first pick was Abukuma''' '''but after her don't know who to give the remaining two. If there is some equipment I NEED to be working on to improve please let me know. I currently working on the my last 35.6 to proto 35.6 (I have 5 already). <ac_metadata title="[Easy/Med] Event Preparations"> </ac_metadata>
