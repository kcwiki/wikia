Just for fun statistics, where you will see if you're ahead or behind everyone else.

<span style="font-size:18px;">What is the latest map you have already cleared?</span>

{{VotesTally1|None|E-1|E-2|E-3|E-4|E-5|E-6}}


'''How to Vote on the new Tally''':
 <nowiki>{{Vote|E-5|your comments here}}</nowiki>
''For no clears:''
 <nowiki>{{Vote|None|your comments here}}</nowiki>

* Use the code only once, put the latest map '''you have cleared''', not the one your are in now.
* When you clear another map, edit your reply and edit the code, do not use the code twice.<ac_metadata title="Teitoku Event Clear Status" related_topics="Summer 2014 Event"> </ac_metadata>
