I've searched and found a few topics on this issue about having multiple emails but I only ever had one email (gmail) registered to dmm back in 2014. I stopped about over a year ago due to computer issues and coming back I had to repick a server and start over. Also I can't find any purchase history on my account even though I did charge a point card way back.<ac_metadata title="Coming back and account is gone?"> </ac_metadata>
