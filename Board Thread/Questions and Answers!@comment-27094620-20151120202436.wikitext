I've asked this somewhere around the wiki but nobody is answering. So, I decided to ask here about full server issue. I'm inviting my friend to play along the game but all the servers are full.Â 

Are there any chance for the server to be added or maybe they could ban some very old inactive player maybe??<ac_metadata title="Full server issue..."> </ac_metadata>
