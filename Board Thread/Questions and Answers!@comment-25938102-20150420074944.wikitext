Hello/Â thanks for reading my bad english :3

I'm on a work for forking & translating this wiki to a korean localized one (http://ko.kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Kancolle_%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD_%EC%9C%84%ED%82%A4 ), since the biggest wiki that contains kancolle has troll blown up by a admin's license privatization s**t, me, some fans decided to establish a korean kancolle wikia from scratch.

since we have a no contents for our own, me, and some fellows on forking english(while others on japanese) wikia and translating to my language.(it includes templates and images too) I thought it would be ok since it shares a same license and copyright policies but I want to make it clear. for forking what is forbidden or what sensible matters to avoid.<ac_metadata title="Need some advice on Fork-translating for localized kancolle wikia."> </ac_metadata>
