'''Important Notes for Template'''
* Instruction of how to use this template is [[Template:NanaminFleetKai|here]].
* For single fleet, delete #Escort Fleet.
* ''header_bg'', ''ship_card_bg'', ''equip_icon_bg'', ''equip_bg'', ''equip_locked_bg'', ''extra_cells_bg'' should not be changed. They are pre inputted make thing easier to look into and oragnize.
* Admins and Moderators may edit or remove posts that contain template mishaps or intentional attempts to break the mechanism.

'''What should not be posted here'''
* Enemy encounters. Please post enemy screenshots on the [[Thread:232592|enemy report thread here]].

==Suggested Compositions==
===Surface Task Force (Recommended)===
* '''<u>Main Fleet</u>''': 1 CA/V, 4 BB, 1 CV  (Should include at least 1 Slow BB to go to F)
** '''<u>Escort Fleet</u>''': 2 CLT, 1 CL, 2 DD, 1 FBB

<u>Notes</u>: Try to use [[Fleet Command Facility]] (FCF)on first fleet flagship. Boss has no air power except for final clear, 108+ air power for air parity at preboss. After final clear the boss difficulty resets to normal form. Focus on night battle equips on 2nd fleet. AA CI set up is a possibility on the DD. 

Hiryuu class can be a good choice with 2 reppu and 1 bomber and a spare slot for Saiun, [[SCAMP]], etc. Change to higher Air power CV for final clear.  Using a BBV or CAV with Seaplane bombers can help provide a slight boost to air power and also provide air superiority at boss if you have to retreat your CV with FCF.

Alternative composition: Replace CV, CA/V with 2 CVL for air superiority at preboss node.

*<u>Recommended path</u>: Choose G for a very easy node and leads to a easier than normal night battle node at I.

*<u>Alternative Path</u>: H path is a hard first node followed by a moderate difficulty node. K node offers chance of Roma and Maruyu.<ac_metadata title="[Spring 2015 Event] E-6 - Fleet"> </ac_metadata>
