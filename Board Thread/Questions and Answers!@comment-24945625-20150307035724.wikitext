Yea, so I sometime make my blog so I can go back and read my thoughts again, I don't really make them so I can hear people commenting (sometimes) and I am wondering if it is possible to prevent anyone from commenting once I have made a blog entry? Just curious, and also because sometimes the comments get too overboard, off topic, annoyingly stubborn, etc etc. Best to have a reply asap, thanks.
