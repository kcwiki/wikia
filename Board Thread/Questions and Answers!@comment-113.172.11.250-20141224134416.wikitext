And so I have so much resources and the recover speed of those res is too fast. I want to do a couple of LSC. But the problem is my DevMat cant recover as fast as I want. Is there any way to farm DevMat? (my wish is to farm at least 25 DevMat/day, but if it isnt possible, plz tell me anything u r thinking of.)
