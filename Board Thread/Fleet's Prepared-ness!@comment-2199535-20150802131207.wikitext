Hello,

new admiral reporting in from Germany.

Im playing since ~3 months now, so this is my first event. 

This is [http://imgur.com/a/MloxA my fleet] (full album) at this time:

Mats: 4k/15k/38k/17k, 148 buckets

I started stockpiling fuel. But farming levels need sooo much :/

It finished leveling Souryuu the other day, she is waiting to be maxed. Hiryuu is leveling this very moment, I want to push her to lvl78 aswell. After this, I will maybe push Kaga another 10 lvls.

But I think maybe I should lvl some CL/CA aswell :D

Any further thoughts about my fleet and which difficulty I should try?
