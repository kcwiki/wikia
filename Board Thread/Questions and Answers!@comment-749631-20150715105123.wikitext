According to CN forum posts, people found that improved equipment and BB fit gun do not help when they are used in support fleet. And 20.3cm (no.2) twin gun as well as the SKC20.3 gun that are released after the introduction of the 10% heavy cruiser night battle accuracy were contemporarily shown as do not able to enjoy that bonus, unlike the "20.3cm gun and its derivative can enjoy the bonus" clain that dev mentioned. And thus, people concluded that there might have a tendency that things introduced later in kancolle would not be part of earlier system. How true is this assumption? 51cm does not affect by BB fit gun systen either but 38.0Kai/38.1cm seem to be affected by the fit gun system. However all data above are subjected to tests that might be affected by extreme luck/unluck. On the other hand, someone hypothesised that the accuracy bonus for 20.3cm (no.2) gun in basic setting within systen is not +1 as proclaimed in game interface, but rather more like 0 or negative. The post consisted of some data but not is there any alternative organization of relative data?<ac_metadata title="CA night battle bonus system, BB fit gun system, equipment improvement system, 20.3 (no.2) gun accuracy, and fleet support system."> </ac_metadata>
