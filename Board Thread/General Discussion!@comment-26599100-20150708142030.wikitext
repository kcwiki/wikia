I've noticed that the site translates kanmusu to shipdaughters. Correct me if I'm wrong but while musume does translate to daughters but it can also mean maidens or young girls informally. Context-wise wouldn't you guys think it's better to call them shipmaidens? Especially since they are always unmarried when they first arrive. Plus I'd like to think that they aren't born on the admiral's dock. Instead they're just graduates of training schools arriving randomly at the docks like from 4-koma.<ac_metadata title="Shipdaughters or shipmaidens?"> </ac_metadata>
