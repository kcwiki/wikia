Hello everyone! Because i'm not have so many free time for leveling my kanmusu, i wonder, i'm really ready for this event (easy, may be medium)? WinEv was my first event in game and i'm don't prepare enough for him. And yes, i'm really baka, cuz my manadgmen skill very bad X(

Well, here the screenshots:

Ok, my own opinion: i need more aircraft all type, espesialy bombers/torpedos and recon planes, more shells all type, more type 3 sonar and depth charge. And yes, I need to improve my equipment (10cm, 203, 356, 41, ap shells etc) to 5 star minimum. I don't lvl up my Akashi-chan, cuz her level allows me to up my eq to 5 star without failure. Moreover, it would be nice to collect even more buckets, just for reinsurance. And i'm not type of admirals, who rush. It's all right for me pass few days or first week and just do what to do for preparations. 

On that moment, i have one BP for Chikuma (but think not remodeling her right now) and lvlup more CA/V and DD.

I would be grateful for any advice, because i'm not experenced admiral, but try my best. And i'm very sorry for my terryblle english, not my nativ langv. But try my best for lerning too. ))

P.S. Wow, my first <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-weight:normal;line-height:normal;white-space:nowrap;">topic</span> on wiki, i'm so extited and embrassed. ))<ac_metadata title="Well, another question about &quot;am i really ready for this?&quot;"> </ac_metadata>
