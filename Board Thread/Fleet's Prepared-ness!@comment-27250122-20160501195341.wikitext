hello everybody. 

i would like you guys to rate my fleet if im prepared for the event or need more time restock up before actually starting the event

p.s. my end goal for the event is to acquire rare ships such as iowa, katsuragi?, U-511?, pola,trophy DDs and also event only reward or rare equipment rewards

P.S. i have 1 amphibious landing craft but kc3 doesnt include it in others so there's that

i also have many low lvl DDs but their not that important

i regret LSCing 7 times for musashi now and rushing this months EO but whats done is done, nothing i can do now but wait.

so.. how do you guys rate my fleet? am i good for the event or should i restock more before starting ?<ac_metadata title="My fleet status"> </ac_metadata>
