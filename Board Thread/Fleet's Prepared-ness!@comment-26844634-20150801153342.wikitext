hi everyone! i just started playing only last week (so no h8 no fl3m pls-) and i just heard about this event so i am like scrEWED HAHA~ i would like some advice on what to do with my current ships to get as far as possible on easy (and possible fleet combinations would be totally cool!)- also is there any difference in doing events rather than normal sorties other than possible rewards/new ships? >v<
