Kinda missed last Winter event because i screw up my work and uni schedule, so i don't have the twin and i hope they won't be needed for branching. Currently strugling with Flightdeck quest (i lost the track), and leveling some destroyers. I don't think i can stockpile much res (abour around 30k each). Right now i kinda confused what to do except finishing questline and leveling DD or CA. I plan to finish next event at least normal and some hard (if possible), any advice is welcome.<ac_metadata title="Need advice for next step"> </ac_metadata>
