I'm currently level 21, played for a good 3 weeks and was wondering what fleet composition i should use since I am always running out of Resources (Mainly fuel and bauxite)...  :(

I am currently running a '''Kaga, Zuikaku, Souryuu, Hiryuu, Kongou, Haruna''' in my First Fleet.

Also,'' is the Kancolle community still alive and active? ''




''(ps. Should I focus more on Destroyers and light cruisers instead?)''




Thanks for reading :)<ac_metadata title="What fleet composition should I use at lower levels?"> </ac_metadata>
