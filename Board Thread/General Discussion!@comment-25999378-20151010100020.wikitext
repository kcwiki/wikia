In Isuzu's trivia section, it still brings up how its a good idea to farm Isuzu to level 12 to collect her radars. Given that its a general waste of time and a fairly outdated method, I was hoping we could just get rid of that section from the trivia entirely? Another user also suggested moving it to the glossary as a note and stating it's outdated.Â <ac_metadata title="Isuzu Trivia suggesting farming for radars" related_topics="Suggestion"> </ac_metadata>
