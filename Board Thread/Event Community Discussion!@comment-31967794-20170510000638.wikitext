Hey, a quick newcomer question for you all.  I've been playing the game for a few months now, and this is my first time being in an event.  However, i'm running into some problems.  I've got the hp bar for E1 empty, but I've not been able to proceed to the next stage.  Do I need to actually beat the submarine princess in order to proceed, or is there something else I need to do?<ac_metadata title="Question about events"> </ac_metadata>
