A few hours earlier, there was hack on wikia, specifically on the [http://dev.wikia.com developers wiki], where we source some of our scripts.

It caused pages to disappear, and get replaced by these messages:
* ''Guys you need to protect your js files''
* ''oops i broke it''
* ''i broke it''

This is not isolated to '''kancolle.wikia.com'''. Any wikia that imports specific scripts from '''dev.wikia.com''' were affected, including elderscrolls, fnaf, etc.

The culprit is a specific wikia user named [http://dev.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Regalis111 Regalis111].

The user edited common scripts that we take from '''dev.wikia.com''' (''which were not protected from public editing''). It was a small blunder for wikia dev, forgetting to restrict editing permissions from these files. It is not a highly technical cyber-battle hack, but a simple ''oops''.

After a few minutes, dev wikia admins started undoing and protecting these pages/scripts from public editing:
