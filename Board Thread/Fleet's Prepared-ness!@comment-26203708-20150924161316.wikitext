Since I'm no hand at coding and stuff, or doing the fancy things like the other discussions here (list of DDs with corresponding picture and levels, etc.) I'll just type it out here. I have a good idea on which ships to level and remodel, and stuff, but you can never be too careful. I might have missed something, so some advice would be appreciated so I could get to work on my fleet as soon as possible to avoid the despair of being unable to clear E-7.
