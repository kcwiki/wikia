==FAQ==
*You will be able to continue playing KanColle during this Maintenance '''as long as you stay logged into the game.'''
**<span style="color:red;">'''WARNING:'''</span> If you logout, turn off the game, you will no longer be able to come back into the game until the DMM Maintenance is finished at 11:00 AM JST.
***Both Browser and [[KanColle Android]] applies.
*DMM Platform and KanColle Servers are separate. Therefore KanColle Servers themselves are not affected by this maintenance as long as you do not logout or turn off the game (if you try to come back in, you are basically trying to log in back into the DMM to play the game, which won't work during this maintenance).
