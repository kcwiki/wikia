Sorry to post it here, but I did not find a suiteable kc3 forum.

I had set 2 monthly missions active while playing with kc3. Then I moved to my parent's house, cleaned 2 of them without having kc3 run (different machine).

Now, I am back at my house and pc and my kc3 still shows me those 2 missions. I cannot wipe them off. These missions are still shown as 'to do' but I cannot do them anymore. I want to get rid of them from the kc3 view. Do you have any suggestion how to get rid of them (except waiting for next month, then clearing them ingame)?<ac_metadata title="kc3 - cleaning zombie missions from view"> </ac_metadata>
