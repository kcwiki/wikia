Hello! I'm looking for advice on what to prioritize using my screws on. I think I've upgraded quite a lot of the important equipments, with less prioritized ones (e.g. searchlight, sonars) on days when I have nothing else to upgrade. These days I've been working on CA and akiguns, and I'd like to get some opinions on what I should prioritize upgrading from this point onwards.[[File:180203equipment.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Equipment improvement advice"> </ac_metadata>
