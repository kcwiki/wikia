Theres a fubuki and akatsuki 70 as well as nachi 65 missing from that. Also willing to do a map or two on easy if neccessary, just dont want to miss any exclusive items like 14+ atk bombers or 9 acc radars that may be locked away on med/hard.

I have 2 BPs that I want to use on bismark but will hold in case I need fusou/tone/abukuma to clear a map.

I got akashi just a little over a week ago and only have about 80 screws, maybe up to 100 by the time event starts so I wanted to know how best to budget those.

I'm thinking about spreading it out so I have a little bit of upgrades on everything

2 torp CI setups, 3 +4 quints and a +4 quad will cost 34 screws on top of what i already spent

guns for 4 BBs so 4 +4 41cms, 2 +4 38cms, 1 prototype 35.6 and a +4 35.6 cm will cost an additional 44 screws.

4 +4 20.3 no 2s will be 18 more screws unless a +0 20.3 #3 is better than a +4 no2? I can get kinugasa to 55 and grab that gun if thats the case.

4 +4 type 91 APs will cost about 10 more screws which takes me over 100 already.

Is there a better way to spend the screws/something I'm missing? should I scale back and bit and +1 some more guns? I believe 2 +1 guns each give 1/2 the bonus of 2 +4s with 1/4 the cost if i understand that right.

I left out DD guns since barring a DD only map  I dont feel DD shelling is very important at all, much rather just use AACI or torp CI on them. Plus I already burned 30+ screws on a 10cm+AAFD which i regret atm and I dont feel like 16 screws for 2 +4 12.7 kais is worth it compared to better BB/CA guns.

Also is there anything I should be crafting? currently im working on getting more type 0 obs planes. zuikaku quest line should put me at 8 reppu equivalents

Current resources 70k/70k/50k/37k with 900 buckets, stockpiling about 5kfuel/ammo a day.
