It just isn't happening. I'm using both support expeditions, but Re-class or the flagship always survive the day battle and then don't die during the night. What the fuck am I meant to do here? I don't have any night aircraft, and I need to clear this bullshit quest </span>to get the night personel. I have done 12 sorties for this quest so far, the majority of which were stopped at node E regardless of if I had a support expedition or not. Someone save me from this fucking bullshit, otherwise I'll just keep bashing my head against this untill all of my resources fucking hemorage out.[[File:Please_fucking_save_me_from_B105.png|thumb|All ships are sparkled.]]<ac_metadata title="Saratoga B105 please help"> </ac_metadata>
