Hi everyone, new here, unfamiliar with the forum's system, hope I didn't get anything wrong.

Let's get to the topic. All ships have recieved their respective best remodel at their level, unless indicated otherwise.

Naval Aviation: Not much of a problem, I have all non-Unryu-class CVAs at Lv99, with 14 Ryuusei-Kais(or better equvilant) and around 15 Reppus. CVLs may be more of a concern, since I only have Chitose&Chiyoda at 99, Ryujo at 77, and Zuihou at 62.

Surface Fleet: Major trouble. No slow battleships, only Hiei and Kirishima (both 81); No CAVs, only Choukai (56) and Maya (65)

Torp. Squadron: Better than what it was. Kitakami at 72, Ooi at 60, Isuzu at 63, Sendai at 61. Also with Ayanami (70), Shigure (65), Yukikaze (60)

Submarines: Everyone except I-8, level at around 35~43, not a competant fleet just yet. Taigei is still Lv1 BTW.

From the experience earned in the Spring Event, this fleet should work fine unless the event requires:

(a) Surface Task Force

(b) Ship Lock

So I set my goal as "Passing the whole event in Medium Difficulty, while evading Night Battle Maps and/or Ship Locks by taking Easy Difficulty". Currently I plan to enter the event with the fleet above and around 50K resources and 300 buckets. Is there anything else I need to prepare?

Thanks in advance for anyone who would give their advice.<ac_metadata title="For Medium Difficulty, what else do I need?"> </ac_metadata>
