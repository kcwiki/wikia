= and then i tried again using my other email for example: qqq@yahoo.com but it is not my email address for playing kancolle, but i got the email reset on my spam folder so i go to password change page and changed it<br />= after i change it, it said they sent me email again to confirm it. yeah i got the email but theres nothing to click so i assume it just a notification for me,<br />= but when i try to login it back to password reset notification page again, im sure that im already logout id from any device ,</span></p>
