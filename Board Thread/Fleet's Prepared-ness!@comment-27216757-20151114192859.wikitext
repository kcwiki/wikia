Hello everyone, and thanks for reading my post. I start this game early september (the last two or three days of Summer event) only manage to clear E-1 and getting 2 Kongou sisters (which help me alot in clearing some maps later until 3-2).

Since this will be my first event when I'm actually trying to prepare...I seek some opinions and tips for the last couple of days. I'm playing below softcap (except steel...is 60k right now and continues...) 570 buckets.

I can only play well on weekends and the first days of the week because of work and studies so the only thing I can do sometimes is spaming expeditions. If I reach softcap LSC every 2 weeks or Spamming recipes for Equipment. Sometimes I even use Yamato class for eating resourses to keep abusing natural regeneration...because I think I lost more that I win per day without it.

I donÂ´t know if this is good enough and with some info I have been reading I'm gonna level up some destroyers and Light Cruisers just in case. My BBV are...well pictures say everything. I tried my best to do a good set-up and level them up.

This is my fleet and actual equipment.

I am plaining to have some fun and try to get some rare ships and go serious on Winter event (yeah thats a lot of time...but I will aim for medium then).

Please give some opinions.
