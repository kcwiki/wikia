[[File:Equipment_List_2019-08-03.jpg|thumb|Gear list because this is where my questions lie...]]I have been at this game for a little over 2 years now. I have managed, somehow, to get myself 'caught up' in that the only ships that are lacking their upgrades are Kongou, Umikaze, Suzuya and Kumano.

- Kongou is a really low priority for me right now (mostly because I don't have 300 Devmats)<br />
- I have no real desire to change Suzuya and/or Kumano to CVLs, nor do I particularly feel like raising dupes so I can a set of each.<br />
- Umikaze will get where she needs to be soon...

This being said, this is not really about which girl(s) to focus on and level up. I have enough of every kind of ship-class at high enough levels to do the jobs that need to be done.

The quesiton, instead, is a matter of gear and equipment and where my focus should lie.
I know there are some thigns that I can still work on (see some of my thoughts), but the question is is there any sort of priority here above and beyond "whatever feels right"? Is there something that I can work on in preparation for the next event?

This being said, this is where I feel that I stand with all of my gear:

'''BB Guns'''<br />
- 6x +10 Proto 35.6cm Triple - I don't see much of a need to have more of these guns or those of a similar 'class'.<br />
- 41cm Twin - I don't see a need to put more work/effort into these. Other guns of a similar type are objectivly superior. There is the possibility of upgrading some of these to Proto 41cm Triple for upgrading purposes, but that is expensive and so long-term that I don't think it's worth mentioning.<br />
- 46cm Triple - Should I bother with these? If so, how many? I know that they are useful for Support Expeditions, but beyond that the only girls that can carry these without penalty are Yamato and Musashi.<br />
- Specialty Guns (Richelieu, Pasta, 16inch of all kinds) - These all have merit, but are largely limited to their specific girls, so these are seen as lower for focus

'''Cruiser Guns'''<br />
The 20.3cm (No.3) is, objectivly, the best gun for cruisers right now. I have 10 of these, and they will be upgraded as necessary. Other guns are kept on-hand either due to rarity or as modfood.

'''Destroyer Guns'''<br />
I'm a bit at a loss here. While I can upgrade my 12.7cm Model D K2s to +6, I don't see these as a priority. I could, in theory, upgrade the 12.7cm Model C K2s beyond +6, but those will use unbuildable 12.7cm Model B K2s...<br />
While I know that I can work on my ducky-guns, the fact of the matter is that I have gone so long without them, I don't really know what to do *with* them. While I understand that these are the best guns you can usually put on a Destroyer, a fair number of girls get bonuses for equipping certain guns that, when dealing with raw firepower, are better...

'''Secondary (Yellow) Guns'''<br />
Only guns I see worth upgrading are the OTOs. There just isn't enough of a call for these kinds of guns as a general thing.

'''Torpedoes'''<br />
I don't subscribe to TCI as a general thing, but I am aware that it will be something will, likely, be relied on in the future. This said, I'm not sure which torpedoes to focus on and how many I really need...

'''Aircraft'''<br />
I think I have this pretty much squared away. After Summer 2017, I have not run into a problem of not having enough Seaplane Fighters. My only limitation is lack of Screws, Devmats and Modfood.

'''Radar'''<br />
Eh? I don't know. Seriously. I have no idea if I should invest in upgrades here

'''ASW'''<br />
There are pieces of gear that I can upgrade (Sonar, T3 Projectors), but should these be a priority?

'''Misc Gear'''<br />
Anti-Installation, AA guns, turbines and anything else not mentioned that can be upgraded... should there be a focus here? [[File:Ship_List_2019-08-03.jpg|thumb|Ship List for reference.]]<ac_metadata title="...so what now?"> </ac_metadata>
