I feel like now that we know the event is later in August that I might have started pooling resources earlier than I actually needed too so I'm thinking I might do a little bit of leveling here and there without going ham on my resources too hard.  Any suggestions are welcome.  On a side note I am currently leveling Kako, Mutsu, Mizuho, Taihou, Teruzuki and Hibiki through PVP and Taihou's level is due to the fact that I just got her literally tonight.  

For equipments I know I need to work on my Sonar and Depth Charges as that seems to be the achillies heal to my equipment.
