Well another event is over, this one full of salt, frustration, and maybe occasional happy moments.Â  And I think it's a good time to use our experiences to come up with some new Kancolle-themed Cards Against Humanity cards (see this post if you don't know about it: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Kevadu/KanColle_and_Cards_Against_Humanity).

So post your suggestions here.<ac_metadata title="Cards Against KanColle, new cards time!"> </ac_metadata>
