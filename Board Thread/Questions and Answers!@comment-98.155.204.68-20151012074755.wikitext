I just started playing Kancolle (after 9 months of procrastination xD) and all I've been obtaining were Destroyers. I have one light cruiser but my fleet can't really surpass the first node on 1-2. I'm training my destroyers and trying to get a different type of ship but any advice on how to jump-start my fleet so they can actually "destroy"? (no pun intended)<ac_metadata title="Advice wanted"> </ac_metadata>
