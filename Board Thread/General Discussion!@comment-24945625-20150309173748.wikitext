latest upgrade in the game...

A market that allows you trade off one of the types of resources you have extra for another!

I just have way too much steel after running TE II indefinitely and not spending much steel everyday lol

right now my count for steel hits almost 130k mark already whereas my fuel count reaches 50k, ammo half of that, and bauxite count not even worth mentioning... = =" I need that trade off function planted! XD though that'd definitely impact the game business, I imagine.
