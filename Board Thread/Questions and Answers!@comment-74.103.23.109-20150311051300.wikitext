So I am a fairly new KanColle player, with my HQ being level 18 atm. I have a few questions about certain ships.

So my current setup for my main fleet is:

Kongou lvl. 23 (Flagship)

Akagi lvl.21

Maya lvl. 19

Atago lvl. 16

Ise lvl. 14

Jun'you lvl. 19

As you can see, my setup doesnt have any destroyers or light carriers. The reason is that I don't really get the point of them. Heavy carriers are just light carriers that do more damage and have more health but are slower and have more resupply costs. Destroyers don't really do much for me unless I have 2-3 in my group. I was wondering what is the point of using light carriers or destroyers? I was also wondering if my comp was good or if any changes should be made to it.
