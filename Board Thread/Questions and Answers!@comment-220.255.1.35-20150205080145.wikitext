I am currently trying to clear world 2-5, and trying my luck at getting Akashi. I am following the guide and trying out the different combinations of ships to try and reach the boss node, however, most of the time I end up at the J node or K node most of the time. The guide said i must reach the LoS requirement to reach the boss node so i have been wonder what does it mean.<ac_metadata title="What does LoS requirement means?"> </ac_metadata>
