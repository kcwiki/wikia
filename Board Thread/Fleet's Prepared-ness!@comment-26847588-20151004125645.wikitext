After the turbulant ordeial of the summer event, I came to realize that I have to spend more time in this game for a smoother clearing. E-6 Medium was especially hard since most of my good ships were shiplocked, making me lose my sanity. I would like to ask in what direction should I procced in to avoid another hell like E-6 Medium. I am a bit lost on who shall I give my next blueprint to, and who should I do a luck moderization on.
