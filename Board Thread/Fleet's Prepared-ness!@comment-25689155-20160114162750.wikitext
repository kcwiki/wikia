Hi guys, I'm joining once again the hype for next event. I just wanted your opinion on my fleet and my equipments, you can check that on my profile page here :Â http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User:Muuus

I was wondering if I didn't forget anything important, like any good piece of equipments, or a key ship. I'm kinda late game now, so I don't mind being given late game advice. What I'm doing in the game now is only clearing weeklies/monthlies, doing LSC for Maruyu feeding, Akashi upgrading, and sometimes grinding for a ship I like.<ac_metadata title="Did I forget something important ?"> </ac_metadata>
