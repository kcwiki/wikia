I don't know what's wrong, can't use API link after 2 weeks playing with it via firefox, sometimes it work if I setup my clock to japanese server, but it's 100% inaccessible now... so I try to use KCV and KC3 but still no luck, that cat always come after I press start button... Now currently use cookie edit and stop using firefox, so what's wrong with my game? (ps: for trivial information I use my shitty android phone as modem, and I also suspect my phone because sometimes I kicked out by google whenever I try to visit google search engine)<ac_metadata title="Can&#039;t use viewer"> </ac_metadata>
