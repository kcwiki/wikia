Aiming for normal difficulty event in Autumn (if it even comes, seeing literally no info on it). I'm planning to focus 3 more girls:

Furutaka (she's cute), Ooshio (DLC DD) and Ooi (2nd CLT)

Their escorts will consist of: Chitose AV, Akitsu Maru and Hyuuga all aiming for 50 by "passive" leveling. I was thinking of getting Asashio to 85 for her ASW.

Should I Kai Ni or level someone else? Maybe level the 50+ girls to 60? I'd love to avoid DD leveling if possible, but as Hacchan says "shikata nai" - I'll do it if I have to. Please keep in mind that I'm not a very rich teitoku and currently at 37k / 33k / 29k / 30k resources, so I'll have to farm some more before the event starts, hence I can't commit fully to the leveling part. Also need to improve and develop some more equipment (planes and 15.2cm guns first of all).

Below is the list of my 50+ shipgirls, missing Ise due to screen being too small :P Will appreciate any tips and other forms of help, including financial, faith-related and sexual favours. Thanks in advance!



EDIT: If my resources allow to finish the catapult questline, I'll also try to Kai Ni Zuikaku or Shoukaku.

EDIT2: What should I focus on improving first? For now I've been improving 1 screw items mostly, for the daily quest, so assume that nothing has been improved.<ac_metadata title="You are not prepared! Or am I?"> </ac_metadata>
