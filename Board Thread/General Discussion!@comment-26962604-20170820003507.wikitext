Does anyone have their ships unarmed and only put equipment on them if they need to sortie the ships?

For me all of my ships have equipment even though I rarely sortie some of them, but with the event going right now I'm swapping equipment from ship to ship and it's annoying me. And because all of my ships have equipment on them all the time I keep hitting the maximum amount of equipment I can hold.

Suggestions and opinions would be appreciated.<ac_metadata title="Equipment management"> </ac_metadata>
