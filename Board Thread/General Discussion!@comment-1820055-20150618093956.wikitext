As of recent discoveries, we can actually put the interface beside the gamescreen, not on the F12 panel. Do you think we should move it there?

The thing is, you still need to open F12, but after that you can separate it on a new window and minimize. It will feed the main gamescreen the data to show.

'''DJ, you're not making any sense, whats the difference?'''<br />
hmm.. when the interface is on the F12 panel, there are extra toolbars you do not need, Elements, Network, Console, etc. If we move it to the gamescreen, even though F12 panel is still open, you can minimize it then you can focus on what is important.

'''You sound like advertising it, why ask us?'''<br />
There are consequences, unfortunately. This means, you CANNOT use it on DMM website directly! Since we are moving the dashboard interface beside the game screen on the KC3改 special page with your backgrounds, those playing directly from DMM will not have this interface. Previously, they had it coz F12 also works on DMM.

'''Why not both?'''<br />

No. The change is too big to being able to just change it on settings. Choose one.

Interface on F12 panel or Game Screen?
Let it stay on the F12 panel
Move it beside the game screen!
Any. I don't care.
I don't use KC3改, I'm just passing by.
