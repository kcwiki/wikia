Hi there! I would like some tips and advice on how to improve my fleet before the Fall 2016 event. My resources are at 51k Fuel 64k Ammo 28k Steel and 23k Baux, with around 540 buckets. I hope to get around 70k fuel and ammo, 60k steel, and 50k baux. I'm planning on getting bismarck to drei before the event, as well as getting akatsuki to kai ni. Also ashigara k2.

I sadly do not have Akashi or Ooyodo, after many weeks of farming.<ac_metadata title="Help with Medium Fall 2016 Preparations"> </ac_metadata>
