Last night I read about why Nagato got used as target ship on wikipedia and I learned quite a lot. I find it ironic and befitting that in the end, US sank more of its own ships than any foreign enemy. By befitting, I mean a government that betrays its people deals more damage to the country than foreign enemies. Same situation for Japan, the betrayal began before WWII and continues till today. But to be back on topic, the new question I had is that, why the US Army wanted to get rid of the Navy? It seems common that different branches of the army hates each other.<ac_metadata title="Some history question"> </ac_metadata>
