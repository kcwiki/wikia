This thread is a continunation of the discussion that went off track in the Summer Event thread:Â http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:277523#182

(Just follow what OatMealFriend and Ar-cen-ciel said)

Anything regarding this topic will come here instead. If posted there, it will be deleted.



Btw, if this devolved into mindless bickering between you two (or whoever wanted to join) without anything related to the topic then I'll close this thread.<ac_metadata title="Discussion Continuation: Idea regarding Newbie Friendly Access Event"> </ac_metadata>
