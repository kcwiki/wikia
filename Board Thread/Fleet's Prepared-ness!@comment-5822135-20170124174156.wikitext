I'm aiming for medium for now, but I guess I'll ask people anyway.[[File:ShipEquip.png|thumb]]

I have about 70-75k fuel/ammo, 100k steel, 55k bauxite, and I'm doing exp 2-5-6 during day, 11-24-36 during the night.

Current leveling goals are : Satsuki and Choukai (next month BP), followed by Asashio, Kasumi and Akatsuki (someday, cause I'm too lazy to powerlevel them) and Mikuma.<ac_metadata title="What would you recommend me to do until this event ?"> </ac_metadata>
