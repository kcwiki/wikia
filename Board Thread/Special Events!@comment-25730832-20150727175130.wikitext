==Sanity Bar==

{{Progress|Your sanity value}}

'''How this works:'''
Just replace "Your sanity value" with your sanity percentage.
Please use a number in between '''0 to 100''' for now as I did not prepare it for above 100% of negative sanity yet. (Yes,that includes OVER 9000 shit). You can do it (I can't stop you guys), but there won't be anything special and you'll end up with a red block beneath your bar. :v
