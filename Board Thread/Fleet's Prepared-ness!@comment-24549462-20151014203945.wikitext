Not to mimic Arvin30p's post, but after the pounding I took (as did most of us) on the Summer Event, I was wondering what you guys think of my current fleet and where I could use improvement. Â 



Struggling to get my 10cm+AAFD.

Working on Yamato and my Auxillary ships.



I am not prepared to lose another rare ship like Teru.
