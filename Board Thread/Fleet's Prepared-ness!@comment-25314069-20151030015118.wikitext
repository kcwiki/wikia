Looking into doing all hard instead of the medium/hard for the past 2 events

Working on Fuso, Shigure, Myouko and Ryuujou since they are all close to K2

I think my weakness are in BBV, CAV and BB but how should I go about it?

Are there any areas I should improve on that I missed?

Also just got Akashi so what are some key equips I should work on first?

Many thanks
