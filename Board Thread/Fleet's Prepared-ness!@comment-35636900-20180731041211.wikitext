I am getting ready to enter the Summer 2018 Event and have stockpiled roughly ~30000 to 40000 on each resource, in addition to about 400 buckets.[[File:1d1c8b2d-d93a-4bf0-8c15-f5f79554546f.png|thumb]][[File:F67b2520-6497-4c65-86e6-fb02c8f80303.png|thumb]]Â Showcased here is my current fleet. Do you think that I can complete this event fully on easy or casual? If not, then what should I focus on to help prepare for the event? As you can guess, this is my first event and I'm rather inexperienced in such things, so I would enjoy having some assistance from you all. Thanks in advance.<ac_metadata title="Summer 2018 Event Preparations"> </ac_metadata>
