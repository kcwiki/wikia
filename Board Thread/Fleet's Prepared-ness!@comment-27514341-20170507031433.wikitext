Hello, good day. 

I'm getting overwhelmed by the thoughts of locking ships on a map, that should have been more feasible in another map. I still haven't started my E-2N. I'm sure I'm overthinking this, but can I have some advice regarding what ships I should use for these maps, please? 

Also, please smack at me a reality check about doing E-2 / E-3 / E-4 / E-5 Hard with my current fleet. My initial plan is to do Normal for E-2, E-3 and E-4, and Hard for E-5. Is it possible?

Throughout the event, I'll be leveling ships that have Kai Ni. Currently, I'm leveling Nachi and Ashigara to be used for E-2, and Kumano and Mogami (to 60) for E-3.

Current resources: [ 86k Fuel | 75k Ammo | 121k Steel | 66k Bauxite ]. I noticed I'm consuming Ammo fastest at the moment, so I'm doing Expeditions 2-6-(37/38).

I'd appreciate for any inputs. Thank you in advance!
