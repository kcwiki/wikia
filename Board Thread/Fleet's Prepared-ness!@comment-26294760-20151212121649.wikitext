May be it might be too early to think about preparing for the next event right now, since Fall event is over less than a week ago, but in a very short period of time, I've got quite a number of new girls. That number is so high it makes me wonder if I can level all of them before next event, (I have exams and won't be able to do any hardcore leveling until at least Christmas.) so if any one can prioritize things up for me, I'd be appreciated.

I won't key in my whole though, but I'll tell the info about the girls I have with similar capability to the girls I'm choosing.
