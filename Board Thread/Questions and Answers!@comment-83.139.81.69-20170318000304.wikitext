I don´t know about you fellow TTK´s but the new Shelling Cap is broken and is just raining salt everywhere,epecially EO maps,at least from todays sorties on EO maps for me..

Example: 

EO 3-5

Fleet setup: 3 CV 3 CA (all +80lvl),all rare equpment,401 Air Power,Maya AACI setup,Sanshiki on Ashigara and Haguro

Kaga Kai

Ashigara K2

Haguro K2

Maya K2

Hiryu K2

Souryu K2

1st sortie(North route):

1st battle: No casualties(all sparkled)

2nd battle: Ashigara Taiha´d from full hp to 2HP! - Forced retreat.

2nd sortie(North route):

1 st battle: Ashigara taiha´d from full HP to 7HP!(AGAIN) - Forced retreat

3rd sortie:

1st battle:   Haguro taiha´d from full HP to 4HP!



This is ridiculous,even with sparkled ships,the most dmg u can get from the enemy Ta-class BB is chuuha-near taiha..I dont know what to say.I would appriciate opinions about the new modified day shelling cap.<ac_metadata title="NEW Increased Firepower Shelling Cap -OPINIONS."> </ac_metadata>
