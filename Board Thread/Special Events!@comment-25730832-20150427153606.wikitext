This is an attempt to gather fleet composition reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">E-3</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[Spring 2015 Event]] comments.

<span style="color: red;">Please do not remove the "text_only" variable from the template. As some people are having issues loading so many ship card images, they are being switched to text format. Thank you for your understanding in this matter.</span>

'''Important Notes for Template'''
* Instruction of how to use this template is [[Template:NanaminFleetKai|here]].
* For single fleet, delete #Escort Fleet.
* ''header_bg'', ''ship_card_bg'', ''equip_icon_bg'', ''equip_bg'', ''equip_locked_bg'', ''extra_cells_bg'' should not be changed. They are pre inputted make thing easier to look into and oragnize.
* Admins and Moderators may edit or remove posts that contain template mishaps or intentional attempts to break the mechanism.

'''What should not be posted here'''
* Enemy encounters. Please post enemy screenshots on the [[Thread:232582|on the enemy report thread for E-3]]

==Suggested Composition==
* '''<u>Main Fleet</u>''': 1 FBB, 3CA(V), 1 CVL, 1 DD
** '''<u>Route</u>''': ''A-C-D-E-J''
<u>'''Notes'''</u>:
*35+ for AS, 69+ for AS+
*This is the first map involving ship locking.  If you intend to complete E-4 or E-5 on medium or hard difficulty, try to plan for saving ships that you need to complete them. Saving ships for E-5 is highly recommended since that has very rigid requirements. E-4 is a combined fleet map. You should not use BBV or CV on this map, but otherwise it is relatively flexible and you can try using whatever ships you don't need.<ac_metadata title="[Spring 2015 Event] E-3 - Fleets"> </ac_metadata>
