I know that you can't sortie a fleet with a flagship with a probability of sinking.... I had a combined fleet with a moderately damaged ship and cant sortie but when replaced with a ship with no damage I can sortie just fine so...



Can moderately damaged ships be sunk at event maps?

P.S. also did my calculations.... they're moderately damage with HP of 29% so they really shouldn't be sinking <ac_metadata title="E-2 can&#039;t sortie a combined fleet with a moderately damaged flagship" related_topics="Spring 2015 Event" lastmove="1452417392"> </ac_metadata>
