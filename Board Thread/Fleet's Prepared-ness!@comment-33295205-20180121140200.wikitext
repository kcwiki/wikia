Good day fellow Admirals, I would like to request honest feedback of my fleet and it's equipment.  I'm planning for Medium/Easy mix and possible Hard if opportunity presents itself for better reward.  My current resource is 240K/240K/250K/210K buckets of 2065.  Here are my ship listing and equipment provided for examination.  Any advice is highly appreciated.
