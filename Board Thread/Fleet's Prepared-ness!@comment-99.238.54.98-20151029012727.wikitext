Hey everyone,

This would be my third event this year (Only completeing up to E2 from the Spring, E3 from Summer) And I'm looking to improve and try my best at the Fall Event (And to at least make it to E5). Currently, I am at Level 71, and the last main campaign map I was able to clear was 5-2. I also just used a lot of resources for a failed LSC, but I'm currently saving them up for the event (I think I have around 3K/18K/6K/3K, 29 buckets.) as well as doing expeditions here and there to collect more buckets and resources.

I feel like my fleet is OK; I'm currently training all of my CA's (Maya Kai, Kumano, Myoukou, Kako, Takao) @ 3-2, as well as Sendai Kai and Shigure Kai at 1-5 (along with Hyuuga and RJ). Is there any tips you have for me? Are there any other ships I should focus on training?<ac_metadata title="Could I go easy all the way?"> </ac_metadata>
