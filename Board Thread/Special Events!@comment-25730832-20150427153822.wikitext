==Suggested Composition==
===Carrier Task Force===
* <u>'''Main Fleet'''</u>: 2 (F)BB(V), 4 CV
** <u>'''Escort Fleet'''</u>: 1 CL, 2 DD, 1 CLT, 2 CA(V)
** <u>'''Route'''</u>: ''B-F-E-M''
<u>'''Notes'''</u>:
* Equip a {{GreenAmmo}}[[Type 3 Shell]] on all CA(V) and BB to deal significant damage against the [[Harbour Water Demon]].
<!--- >>>>This is being hidden until the grammar is fixed up, because I can't tell what you're trying to say and fix it myself<<<< * For installation bosses (land based targets), torpedos attacks including torpedo bomber opening air strike and can not hit installations and torpedo stat does not factor into night battle damge against these targets.--->
* Carriers will be unable to target the [[Harbour Water Demon]] (and any other installation bosses) if they are equipped with a {{RedPlane}}Dive Bomber. If you want carriers to be able to attack the installation, equip {{BluePlane}}Torpedo Bombers instead.<ac_metadata title="[Spring 2015 Event] E-4 - Fleets"> </ac_metadata>
