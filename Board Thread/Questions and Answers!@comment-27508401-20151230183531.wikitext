So I've been having nonstop issues trying to get Kancolle to work recently. I rebuilt my computer right after Christmas and haven't been able to check anything since. Part of me is almost curious if I've somehow managed to get my account banned somehow....

I've tried following the cookie region steps on the Connection guide, as well as using several of the programs (KC3 and Kancolle Viewer) in an effort to reconnect, but nothing seems to work. It loads to the main screen with zero issues, but regardless of what I try it always gives me this screen

[[File:Error_.png|thumb]]Any thoughts on what might be going wrong or what I could try?

I'll also apologize in advance if this isn't the right place to post this<ac_metadata title="Infernal Cat Screen"> </ac_metadata>
