Hi all, the upcoming Fall event will be my 2nd event. I was underprepared during the Summer event and had to do all the event maps on Easy mode. (except for E1 on Hard & E2 on Medium). Thus I would like to know how I can improve my fleet & equipment. My fleet & equipment are as shown in the pictures. My list of ships are sorted by ship class.

Resources: 806 buckets, 114k fuel, 102k ammo, 150k steel, 60k bauxite.[[File:KC_4-11-2015_Fleet_Masterlist.jpg|thumb|Ship List sorted by Ship Class]]

Aiming for a medium/hard mode mix.[[File:KC_4-11-2015_Equips_Masterlist.jpg|thumb|Equipment]]<ac_metadata title="Need Advice on Fleet, Equipment and what difficulty level to choose"> </ac_metadata>
