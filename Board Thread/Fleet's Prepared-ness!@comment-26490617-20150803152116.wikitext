HQ LV: 96

My HQ level is due to my own inability to control it, and it kinda just blew up from clearing maps and doing quests.

This is my first event since signing in and I am unsure if this is enough especially since I am kinda lacking in resources (20k each) but these are my high level ships anyway:

DD: Ushio K2 (70), Verniy (73), Akatsuki K2 (70), Fubuki K2 (70), Murakumo K2 (70), Yuudachi K2 (65), Yukikaze (46)

CL, CLT: Sendai K2 (62), Naka K2 (55), Ooi K2 (50), KTKM K2 (50)

CA, CAV: Haguro K2 (65), Mikuma (45), Ashigara (45)

BB, BBV: Haruna (72), Kongou (60), Fusou (56), Musashi (53), Hyuuga (55), Kirishima (44), Hiei (43)

CV, CVL, CVB: Kaga (70), Taihou (65), Hiryuu (69), Souryuu (52), Zuikaku (43), Akagi (41), Ryuujou K2 (75), Jun'you (50), Hiyou (41)

SS: I-58 (78), I-168 (77), I-19 (62)

I think my strongest point is DD and my weakest point is CA, so I've been trying to level Chikuma and Ashigara.

I also have a spare BP that I've been planning to use on Chikuma (34) since I've heard the Tone Class is way better than the Mogami Class as CAV. Is this OK?
