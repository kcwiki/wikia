Here you may request your forum thread to be highlighted and it will be reviewed by a moderator. It could be news, a community event, a survey or anything deemed worthy by the reviewer.

'''Update'''
* If you highlight or un-highlight a thread, please report it here so we can also track of the count. If anyone has an easy way of knowing this, please inform me.

'''Notes:'''<br />
(these are '''not''' absolute rules to be followed but only reminders and considerations that may be useful to reviewers)
*Can only have a maximum of five highlighted threads at one point. Consider 3 as the softcap where you can check if any other thread could be un-highlighted.
*Threads containing ''newb questions'' (those that can be answered easily by reading the appropriate wikia pages) should not be considered
*Threads with questions that benefit only the OP will be less likely to be considered.
** These might not be newb questions but highlighted question threads are envisioned to be more of a "community sharing" where you want people's voluntary input.
*Local events e.g. conventions where you announce a panel, or your want to ask anyone who else is coming, etc are likely to be considered.
*Those that have time constraints and are urgent are more likely to be considered. Posts that are not based on time, may still be highlighted but only for a limited time just to do q quick notification.<ac_metadata title="[Requests] Thread Highlighting"> </ac_metadata>
