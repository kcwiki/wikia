Looking for areas to improve on, would appreciate feedback in weakest areas, assuming this is full hard mode with shiplock. 
I might attempt to get the Crane sisters past 100 since they're level 98. As of right now Taiyou is almost Kai Ni and my next blueprint will go towards Arashio. I am attempting to raise my CV/CVL level to minimum level 80, since it looks fairly weak. 

Too lazy to bother gathering T21 skilled fighters, since the weekly quests are painful for a person who doesn't orel, since Hayabusa can easily fulfill that same role. 

I've been lazy with a lot of quests lately as well, such as Zuiun skilled quest, Zara k2 quest, Nagato k2 quest, Ooshio k2 quest and Sara planes. Screw wise im at 9 screws, and im not really too bothered to upgrade equipment to another form unless it's ultra useful, thought i might consider the new night planes. 

Edit - would also like some advice for ships to luck mod. Kitakami and Ayanami are luck modded to 50 luck. Might consider luck modding Abukuma, who has 28 luck.
