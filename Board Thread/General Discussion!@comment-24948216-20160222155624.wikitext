I moved from KCV(Yuubari's fork) to KC3Kai right before the event, and I loved it, but Chrome is making me more and more angry with each release, so in anticipation of dropping it soon I moved back to KCV, but I really miss extra functionality KC3 had(mostly on screen quest translations, and quest tracking, but also battle preditctions). So now I'm looking into other viewers that might have what I'm looking for. Yuyuvn fork had at least some of those features, but it's dropped, I tried Electronic Observation but it's too complex and half of it is still untranslated, I also know about Poi, but it requires additional software which puts me off(gonna try it anyway soon though).

Are there any other viewers/KCV forks worth checking out? Apart from classic functionality I need it to send me reliable notifications like KCV does(in visible place, over full screen apps, that's my biggest gripe with Chrome right now)?<ac_metadata title="English KC Viewers"> </ac_metadata>
