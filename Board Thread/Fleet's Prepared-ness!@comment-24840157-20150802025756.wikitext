Ok I know this might be an odd question but hear me out. I am a veteran ttk who frankly don't need any help in terms of event prep. My problem is whether to clear the monthly EO before the event or save my rsc and do it after. Unfortunatly, due to irl stuff I will be very busy at the end of the month so I'm afraid that if I put off doing the EO's I might be too busy to do them. But if I do the EO now, I risk not being able to clear the event.

Resouces: 98k/100k/71k/39k

Ships/Equip: Strong enough to clear 5-5 every month

I'm not worry about the easy stuff 1-5, 1-6, 2-5. I'm not sure if I should do the harder ones now.<ac_metadata title="Am I ready for both Event and EO?"> </ac_metadata>
