I quitted Kancolle some time ago (like 6 months? not sure), anyway i started again for the last event (i fell in love with Giuseppe Garibaldi cuz im Italian, lmao) and now im addicted again (oh no), and i need some advices:

-First for the equipments, what should i craft? I need some WG42 (last event was a pain) but im not sure where or if i can get them

-Second: obviously what ships should i prioritize (levelling), specially which are blueprint worth

extra advices:

how many resources do i need for a large event? I usually do normal/easy depending on what the rewards offer (like blueprints or catapults or rare interesting equipments). Last event left me dead in a corner like a damned raccoon, i used everything and now im still gathering resources , what expeditions should i run for farming steel? I know that there will be an update addingÂ new expedition so i hope for something useful




thanks bois[[File:Shipssadd.png|thumb]][[File:Equipadad.png|thumb]][[File:Resourcesee.png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="I need some tips"> </ac_metadata>
