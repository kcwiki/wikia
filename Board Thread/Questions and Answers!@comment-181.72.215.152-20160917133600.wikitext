hi, for the past 2 days ive been having stupidly long loading times, in all screen, in between sorties and everything, exceding the 21 minutes of loading, i realized all steps for troubleshooting and nothing seems to work, the only thing left for me to do is call my provider and see if its their fault

my question is, is there some sort of problemÂ¿? or is it just me having these issues<ac_metadata title="excessive loading times"> </ac_metadata>
