On June 11th, 2018, we are discontinuing wikia chat from KanColle Wikia in favour of a more superior off-the-shelf solution aptly named [https://discordapp.com Discord]. This is in preparation to also potentially discontinue wikia forums for [[community:User_blog:Cristina7/Introducing_Discussions,_a_New_Platform_For_Engaging_Your_Community|wikia's discussions]] should that ever happen. You can read more about the wikia discussions [[Thread:617487|here]] and [[Thread:617489|here]].

Unfortunately, in order to satisfy the requirements by wikia in avoiding to use functionalities which requires mediawiki language that both [[Special:Forum|wikia forums]] and [[Special:Chat|wikia chat]] uses, wikia chat will be removed from KC wikia on June 18th as it is not possible to bring it in compliance with their requirements neither would it satisfy the requirements on KC wikia.

We understand that this is a drastic step and represents a significant change for those of you who are still using the wikia chat, but we must be in compliance with these new regulation.<ac_metadata title="The Future of wikia chat on KanColle Wikia" notify_everyone="1528711938"> </ac_metadata>
