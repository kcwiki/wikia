I'm looking to gauge the community's preference in regards to Kai numbering. Which do you prefer, Kai Ni or Kai 2?

Also consider the following as well:

Kai San / Kai 3<br />
Kai Yon / Kai 4

The reason I'm asking the community about this issue is that I would like to make the wiki consistent in regards to Kai numbering with the Lua implementation. Unfortunately both Kai Ni and Kai 2 are used commonly.

So I'd like to know what the community prefers. This may or may not have an impact on which method the wikia will be changed to be consistent with.

Arguments for Kai Ni are that it's used commonly especially with regards to remodels, and it's faithful to the japanese text.

Arguments for Kai 2 are that it's used in KCV/KC3, and that it's easier to understand.
