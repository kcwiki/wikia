Is the littorio class consider as Fast Battleship? Her starting equips & speed do point to that sublass.

I kinda want to know which main gun to put on her. do 41cm main gun will overweight for her? just like Kongou class.

in that case, then their 381mm/50 Triple gun will not overweight Kongou class & Bismarck. Am I correct?<ac_metadata title="Littorio class"> </ac_metadata>
