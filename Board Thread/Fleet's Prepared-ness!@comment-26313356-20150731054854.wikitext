Probably not (or maybe), but I still need an answer from some veteran.

My resources are around 74k/70k/93k/34k;

It's probably weak, but I'm a little afraid of wasting resources leveling them and get no resources for the event.

I was around 86k Fuel and 80k Ammo, but I already wasted it leveling Kongou/Yamashiro and there are less than 2 weeks till the event starts.

Should I keep leveling some other ships, not being afraid of wasting resources?<ac_metadata title="Is my fleet ready for medium?"> </ac_metadata>
