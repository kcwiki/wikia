I am fully aware that the debate on the designation for the Kaibokans has long ended. However, I found that the direct USN equivalent is a Patrol Coastal Escort. Hull/ ship designation PCE. Has anyone else come across this designation?

Similarities:

-Displacement 

-Roles: Convoy escort, coastal defense, ASW focus

-Speed and propulsion: Diesel engines, speed
