Good evening everyone,<br>
there seems to be some gap in our GS calculation for non-drum expeditions.<br>
On my part I had 4 sparkled ships for exp. 5 and they came back with a higher succesrate than 64%. I had only a sample size of ~20 runs,which proves nothing.<br>
Kitahara said his exp 36 with 6 sparkled ships came back with only great succes for the last 8 months. On japanese sites there seems to be a ~19% bonus per sparkled ship.<br>
To clarify this mystery we are looking for people who are willing to run non-drum expeditions with sparkled ships and note down the great succes and normal succes rates<br>
For reference,following expeditions are recommended to run with sparkled ships<br> 5 ; 9; 11 ; 13; 35 ; 36<br>
any other expeditions (except 21,37 and 38) would achieve the same result,its up to you<br>
And a template how you could present your stuff(you dont have to use it)<br>

a;b;c....;h are variables,you put your numbers there<br>
x;y and z are the number of the expeditions you are running <ac_metadata title="Looking for Testsubjects" notify_everyone="1431476372"> </ac_metadata>
