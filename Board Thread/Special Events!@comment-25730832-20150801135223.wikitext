'''Important Notes for Template'''

* Instruction of how to use this template is [[Template:EventComp|here]].
* Admins and Moderators may edit or remove posts that contain template mishaps or intentional attempts to break the mechanism.

'''What should not be posted here'''
* Enemy encounters. Please post enemy screenshots on the [[Thread:292552|enemy report thread here for E-5]].
