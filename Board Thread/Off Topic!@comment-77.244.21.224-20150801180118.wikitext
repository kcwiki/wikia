Hello. Today I re-installed my windows and now I have some problems with KanColle. So, is information about admirals stored in server or not? If yes, how can i login in this server again? How can i re-choose server? <ac_metadata title="Hello, guys, Issues after re-installing my windows." lastmove="1452421140"> </ac_metadata>
