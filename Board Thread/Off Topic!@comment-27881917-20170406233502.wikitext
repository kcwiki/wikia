So today I've noticed that other DMM games are no longer working for me. KanColle still works, thank goodness, but other games like the Strike Witches game now tell me they aren't available in my area. I'm not sure what's going on... has anyone else seen this? 

I've been using the Chrome extension that's supposed to make it look like you're in Japan, and so far it's worked flawlessly till today. I use KC3 to play the game, and I get no issues there, but I'm kind of worried now since this happened suddenly and for apparently no reason. 

Can't find info online because these other games just aren't popular outside Japan. Anyone have any ideas what might be going on or how to fix it other than using a VPN? Never had to before. <ac_metadata title="Game Not Available in Your Region for other DMM games"> </ac_metadata>
