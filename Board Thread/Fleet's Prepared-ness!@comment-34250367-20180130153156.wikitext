Hey fellow TTKs,
i've been playing since the start of December and i'd love to join the event (esp. as a Musashi-fan), so i'd appreciate any help you guys could give me. I've not really played after any major guides (more or less just read how the mechanics work, branching rules for the maps and good spots to level), so i kind of only leveled a few ships i like and stockpiled a bit so far. I was able to unlock 4-4, but did not yet try to clear it.

I was told to get Isuzu Kai Ni and more CAVs, which i will definetily try to do, i hope i'll be able to make it in time. As i've come to understand, Maya Kai Ni would be good to, but i don't think i'll be able to level her in time, i'll try to get her up as much as i can though. Chitose and Chiyoda were advised too, i'll put them on my list, but again, probably not able to make it in time.

Concerning equipment, i don't have any super good stuff, only a few good? airbase aircraft out of quests (Raiden, Shiden M11, Catalina) and that's about it i think.

I am happy about any help i can get - thanks to everybody in advance!
