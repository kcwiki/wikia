So, since today, when I tried logging in, I keep getting sent to this link: http://www.dmm.com/top/-/error/area/ 

I don't recall doing anything to my computer that would change it. Regardless, I tried to delete my browser cache, input the cookie into the console again, checked that my timezone was that of Sapporo, Japan's and yet it still doesn't seem to work =/
