Hey, there. 

Another question which is asked perpetually. Sorry if this one makes you guys bored or I'm asking in the wrong place, but since this decision is quite crucial, I think just need to make sure I'm speding my Blueprints wisely.



Right now, I have 5 blueprints in my stock (included this month's 1-5,2-5,3-5,4-5. (5-5 is yet to be unlocked or cleared) and I've some ships ready for remodel in my mind. I left the thought I have on each ships too. Wanna hear you guys' oppinions as well.

The one I think of spending.

1. Tone             : Higher Tier CAV, gonna need her in case my Suzuya and Kumano can't handle the map.

2. Chikuma       : Same as Tone

3. Choukai        : Sublime firepower and torpedo. Sweet Skilled lookout and Type 22 radar Kai 4

(To put in context, my whole Myoukou class and Maya are all Kai' ni already. )

4. Abukuma      : Not so sure on this. Everyone start saying she's mandatory, but then my real life saver last time was Jintsuu. And I think that the last time the devs prevent using CLT in E-6 and 7 just to punish the ones who says she's just a useless BP exploiter. I think (or may be illuded) that next time the devs MIGHT go softer on CLT using. 

5. Fusou           : My E-2 hard life saver last time, even if she's just lvl 50-ish then.



The one I think I can leave for later

1. Roma           : I think her unremodeled form is quite formidable enough, may be.

2. Ryuhou         : Nah, you can stay as my cutesy whale-chan a bit longer. I have enough high lvl CVLs. 4 of those are lvl 80+

3. Yamashiro    : Still lvl 50-ish, and I have enough searchlights already. With that attitude, I still need more time for her to grow in me.

4. Shoukaku      : Gotta say that I'm quite devastated by that cold and distant face Konishi gave her in K2 art. (so devastated you might've seen me posting some rants in her page, her gallery page and the flightdeck page.)  Now, that I've coped with that a bit and I got one flight deck now, I'm still not so sure if I should spend my BP on her. I think may be I should wait for Zuikaku K2 and see what she's like since I supsect it's unlikely that their K2 stat are gonna be almost identical like their standard and Kai stat. And the next event is a small scale event so may be CVB isn't that urgent issue.



Thanks for reading all of this and your kind advice.



Edit: Sorry for the wait. Screw the code, I'll just type the whole thing in.

Note: I used Suzuya and Kumano in E-3 medium last time, and they worked perfectly well''' until the final kill, when they force me to accept that Mogami class are lacking of punch when you really need it'''. They were the most reliable CAs when I first got them, but as all the CAs' lvl rises, their evasion becomes an issue. I had to screw up my shiplocking plan and use my Kongou and Haruna to clear the map, that's why I had to clear the rest of the map in Easy.

In addition form that list, I'll have 2 skilled lookouts when I remodel my Kazagumo and Takanami, or 3 if Choukai got the BP as well.



so, this is what my fleet's like now, hope it can tell you guys what I'm lacking and which blueprint eater should get it.



Regarding Shoukaku : I love her. She's the first CV I got and I fell for her instantly after she showed up. To me, she's loving and caring, but all those thing seems to fade away with the K2 art. May be I'll just find some program to edit the pic and use some other fanart instead.<ac_metadata title="Aiming for hard, or at least medium, need help on BP advice."> </ac_metadata>
