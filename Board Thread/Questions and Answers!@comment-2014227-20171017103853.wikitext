For anyone that uses EO, have you been unable to get past logging in without getting a "Navigation to the webpage was canceled" screen after two to three minutes of waiting? It does this while showing the rest of the DMM navigation panels on the internal browser. There were no issues with this yesterday prior to maintenance and the time I turned it off to sleep was the exact time maintenance ended. The only thing that comes to mind is there's a connection.

So far, I've cleared its cache and reapplied the region cookie without any difference. Logging in through an actual browser works without issue.<ac_metadata title="[EO] No longer able to use?"> </ac_metadata>
