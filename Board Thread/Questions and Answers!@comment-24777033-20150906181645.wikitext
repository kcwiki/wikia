I've been using KC3 for 6 months, but I still don't know how to activate the admiral's panel.

The thing is F12 in my keyboard turns off the wi-fi connection and I need to click it to boot the benefits, then I need to go to tab Kancolle, which I don't know how.

Is there any alternatives to activate the admiral's panel?<ac_metadata title="KC3: How to use the admiral&#039;s panel?"> </ac_metadata>
