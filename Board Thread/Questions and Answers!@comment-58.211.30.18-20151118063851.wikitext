To all the admirls out there,

I recently have been asked to reset my Kancolle password. However, I also recently realized that I have accidentally changed my email password into something I can't for the life of me recall... T_T

My Japanese is really bad, but from what I can make out, there seems to be an option of changing registration email rather than just changing the password.

To anyone out there, please help!

I don't want to leave my girls just yet.<ac_metadata title="[SOS] How do you change your DMM registration e-mail....?"> </ac_metadata>
