Since i just managed to complete 5/7 maps Spring event in Hard mode, so i'm aiming for an "All-Hard" Summer event. with a medium scale event, i don't know if this is a realistic idea...

Here is my current fleet and resources: [http://imgur.com/a/uDbSf Fleet & Resources]

Currently i'm grinding Isuzu, Yuubari and Libeccio for better ASW ships. I'm also crafting for extra Type 3 SONAR and Depth Charges. I also have 2 spare blue prints and can't yet decided which ships will use them.

Any suggestions are appreciated ;)<ac_metadata title="Fleet Preparations for All Hard Summer Event"> </ac_metadata>
