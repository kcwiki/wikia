Since the last event my fleet improved alot, but am I able to complete the event in Medium or even hard or do i have to run through Easy again?

The ships i've uploaded are probably my most noteworthy ships, I am also power leveling Kiso.

Is there any ships i should look to get?

I have a around 4 reppu, 4 shiden kai 2 and 2 Skilled 21's. Another note worthy thing is a have a 10cmHA+FD
