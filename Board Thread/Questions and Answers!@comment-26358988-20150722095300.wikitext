After a computer restart today, game catbombs me after black loading screen with the ship, loads for a few seconds and catbomb. Usually use KCV to connect. Have tried logging in to dmm through chrome connecting from there using cookie method and a vpn, normally and with incognito, made sure my timezone was correct, checked twitter for any updates and didnt see any, any help would be greatly appreciated! lvl 102 trying to stockpile for events and the cat screen is killing me<ac_metadata title="Kancolle catbomb after clicking start game."> </ac_metadata>
