To all: Since the 1-6 came out I have notice quite few people using the lazy route to sail for resource(e.g:1 lv70+flagship+5 lv1-3 for decoy). Then I been thinking the game should make a punishment for sinking ships. Here is the idea:

-For those HQ lv 15+ each time sink a ship you lost 5% of resource include buckets.

-HQ lv 30+ lost 10% resource+buckets.

-HQ lv 80+ lost 20% resource+buckets.

HQ lv 100+ lost 30% resource+buckets.

Reason I thought of that idea is due to higher lv you most likely to have a lot of *useless* ships and waiting to be feed/scrap. Also it kinda reduce the idea of people using ships to decoy to get resource.(Sorry for my bad english)<ac_metadata title="Idea for punishment for sinking ships?"> </ac_metadata>
