This is going to be my second event, and i have grinded quite a few ships to try to prepare for this event and im wondering how prepared i will be for hard(idealy). http://imgur.com/a/1shTV

i dont have that many good planes (curse you RNGesus), and not many radars either, but hopefully ill be able to craft a bit more before event starts. 

the picture is a bit outdated (by a few days) i have 1 more reppu and 2 more shiden kai2 than in the picture, and a few of my ships have been leveled up a bit. <ac_metadata title="Advice needed"> </ac_metadata>
