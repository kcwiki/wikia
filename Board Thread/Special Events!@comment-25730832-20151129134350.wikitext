So you cleared Fall 2015, got to experience bucket intensive runs with your lovely DD/CLs and got some PTSD from those babies from satan's anus.Â 

What is your final impression of this event? When I said final, I mean give your impression after you completed the event and have nothing else to do with it anymore (except a few for-the-hell-of-it runs)

Any rants are also welcome but keep it short unless someone wanted to 'discuss' it.
