I heard there were English viewers for this game and I was hoping for more info. Even though this site has translations, it'd be great to be able to read all those screens ingame.

So I'm hoping for info on viewers available, which work with what browsers and/or OS, best one(s), and...links of course :)Â  Unless that's a no-no. In which case, sorry in advance.<ac_metadata title="English viewer(s)"> </ac_metadata>
