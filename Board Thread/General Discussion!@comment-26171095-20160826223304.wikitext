So DMM is having a points promotion: http://www.dmm.com/top/point/paypal/pointback_cp/1608/

The main points:
* The promotion is from August 25 to September 11.
* You must use PayPal to purchase the points.
* It must be your first transaction for points using PayPal ever.
* You must purchase a minimum of 500 yen.
* Purchases within 500 to 4,999 yen receive 100 extra points. 5,000 and over receive 1,000 extra points.
* 1% points back on PayPal transactions.
* You will receive the extra points (the 100 or 1,000) at the end of October.

There's also a retweeting campaign at the bottom. Basically just retweet the campaign's tweet and you have a chance to win points. I'm not sure whether it would pose a problem if you're out of the country (it probably would though, because Japan).<ac_metadata title="DMM Points Promotion" notify_everyone="1472250784"> </ac_metadata>
