I don't understand CVLs, does they work in the same way that my Akagi ? How can we use them in an efficient way ?

My first CVL was Ryuujou, but I never seen her attacking with aircrafts or something like that.Â 

So, they are only efficient with some equipements, no ? Like Type A Ko-Hyoteki and sonars.<ac_metadata title="Light Aircraft Cruiser, how using them ?"> </ac_metadata>
