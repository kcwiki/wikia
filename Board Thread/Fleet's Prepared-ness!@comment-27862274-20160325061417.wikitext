Im kinda new here haha, but i was wondering which areas i need to improve on. Im levelling my CAs and CLs right now and beginning to regen resources for an easy attempt. Defs not trying medium after the last event lmao, didn't even finish it rip. Would happily appreciate comments on areas to build up, including which specific ships/classes to level. I can powerlevel kanmusus pretty fast, so it doesn't matter if the ship is low level. Thinking of powerlevelling Naka, because her Kai Ni is only 48. 

HQ Level - 68 Currently need more buckets, spamming expedition 2 ;-; Soz for picture quality btw
