Do I have any chance of getting Saracchi?  If there ever was an Event I desired to clear at all costs, it would be this one!  

Currently running nonstop Expedition 2-4-10 to stockpile buckets and have committed Ro-chan to Orel-hell to pad Fuel.

Any help would be appreciated! <ac_metadata title="Do I Have Any Chance to Clear Fall Event?"> </ac_metadata>
