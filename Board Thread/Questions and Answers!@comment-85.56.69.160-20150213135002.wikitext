Today i bought 2000 webmoney points and after that i went to DMM through VPN to add the funds into DMM points I followed the guide that is on Kancolle on how to do it so everything went fine and at the end it popped up in the middle that i was exchanging the 2000webmoney points for DMM 2000.On top of that i also recieved an email saying that i have 2000 points.But!But when i entered the game through VPN from the website on the top left it said i have 0 points above the game window which confused me.So if someone can help me with this it would be very apreciated.Thank you in advance.<ac_metadata title="Buying webmoney points and transfering to DMM points"> </ac_metadata>
