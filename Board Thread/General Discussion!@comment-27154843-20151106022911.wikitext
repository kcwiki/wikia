Hi i have a strange problem.

i was going through the gallery and i noticed that some of my ship girls are missing. then i noticed that when i hover my mouse over some of the empty slots i can click on them, and thats where my missing ship girls are. it doesnt effect gameplay so i was fine with it, but the one that does effect gameplay is satsuki. for some reason no matter where i put her, she is always invisible. if i make her flagship, the entire fleet dissapears too. i can't cick on her as secretary, but i can hear her say things when i give her equipment or move back to main screen. i tried sortie but i would freeze before we enter battle, or if she is flagship, right when we start. i thought that i should scrap her and wait for a new one, but i decided to hear if anyone has come aross this problem before and knows how to solve it. if no one knows, then ill try scrapping her.

Its been fixed, thanks for the people who helped :)[[File:43452.png|thumb|when i see her in gallery]][[File:563421.png|thumb|here i am missing satsuki, fumizuki, nagatsuki, kikuzuki, and kuma ]][[File:5742.png|thumb|when i made her flagship]][[File:81.png|thumb|sortieing as flagship]][[File:7jnyb.png|thumb|main page, Satsuki is secretary]]<ac_metadata title="I have a problem..."> </ac_metadata>
