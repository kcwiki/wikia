i want to make another account for my friend, so i registered a new account and went to the online game panel, clicking "Kancolle" , and the kancolle page appeared

the page says to click the button for starting the game, but when i clicked it, it wont respond, same issue when i tried to start from KCV.When i clicked the red button, a pop-up appeared

"An Error occured in the sript of this page"
