So I just got my Maya to Kai Ni (was slowly training her in my PVP team), and I gave her a reinforcement slot. However, I've read things and now I'm slightly unsure how I should set her up and what I should do with the extra slot. 

Should I use a Seaplane to get Daytime Cut-In or an extra Main Gun for firepower? Or should I be going full AACI? 

I've read mixed things about Maya which is why I'm asking. For example, you shouldn't mix her Day-CI with her AACI setup (I'm guessing because either you're getting less AACI and/or less chance of proc with Day-CI chance) and even not giving her Main Guns and just going full AACI with I'm assuming extra AA-Guns or maybe Secondary HA-Guns. So yeah, I'm really confused as to what to do. 

Is she actually viable when mixed? Or should I stick to AACI, and then change to full DACI if I need another CA with that instead.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
