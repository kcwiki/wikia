Hi folks, I kinda stopped playing at Kancolle after getting Akashi and I logged in for the last time a few months later to get my long awaited Haruna Kai 2.

One of the reasons why i quitted were the fact that I had to get a new API at the beginning of each month because 1-5 wouldn't reset and I had some small issues to get my VPN working (I couldn't connect to most of MS-STTP VPNs and L2TP VPNs were not working for me). And there was that API-pocalypse too.

So I'd like to know if it was still the case of if the issue is more browser/cache clearing related.



One more question, is it safe to play it on two computers with the same internet connexion and the same API, not at the same time ? For example, start the day on the desktop computer, then continue it on a laptop in the same local network ?<ac_metadata title="Getting back at Kancolle"> </ac_metadata>
