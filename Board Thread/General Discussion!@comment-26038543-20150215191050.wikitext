I need help with 2-4. I don't see any branching rules but the compass always sent to B. I know I am capable of beating 2-4 (I take very little dmg from the first 2 nodes) but the compass never send me to the boss. My comp is 4BB (sometimes has BBV) and 2CV. Please help me. I've run 2-4 like 40+ times and 90% sent to B 10% sent to K (from K I never get to go to boss either). The only time I was sent to F was a long time ago, but at that time I wasn't strong enough.<ac_metadata title="Stuck on 2-4 because of compass"> </ac_metadata>
