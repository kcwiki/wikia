As you could probably read in the title i am trying to find ways of using expeditions to bring my resources up to snuff. (Mainly because i have been wanted to do the events for so long but due to my lack of experienced ships I went hard in training and lost all my resources as a result....)

I have seen the guides on sparkling and all and I probably could do that but I was wondering if there were any tips. Like: head straight to World 4/5 expedition and go there. (Because at the moment i have all of world 1 and 2 unlocked but not all of word 3). Maybe I could get some help redesigning my 2,3 and 4th fleet.
 Any help would be appreciated. Here is what i am working with.
