This is a small test I conducted by myself. In the image, important points are marked in red. For the sake of simplicity, I will not state the subtypes of BB and CV ship types (FBB, BBV, CVL, CVB) and simply write them as such.

My first point is: This composition satisfies the requirement written above for going F-H, both in terms of ship and eLoS. The 2 eLoS value are reasonably acceptable for HQ level 106 in failing the first check to I and passing the second one. I may have missed something (which may have been written in the article or not) for my fleet to head towards E instead of H, but what may that be is the important thing. I have arrived to several possible conclusions:
#Using 2CV and 1LHA will direct the fleet to E <b><span class=explain title="This is the important point because I should have achieved the desired eLoS requirement for going H.">regardless of eLoS</span></b>.
#Using 2CV and 0DD will direct the fleet to E <b><span class=explain title="This is the important point because I should have achieved the desired eLoS requirement for going H.">regardless of eLoS</span></b>. This assumption has basis in that both recommended compositions above for the route B-F-H/I-K use 1BB 1CV 2DD while not having 2CV 0DD; the table also state that with a minimum of 2DD and maximum of 1BB 1CV, the route to E is cancelled.
#The combination of the two points above.
#There is a leap in the eLoS requirement for going H between HQ 105 and 106, which I think is strange. The reason is stated below.

My second point is: As far as I know it, the "eLoS" mentioned in this article is the outcome of a formula that incorporates HQ level. Therefore, instead of saying <i>"eLoS requirement rises with HQ level"</i>, it should be <i>"to maintain eLoS with a rising HQ level, measures have to be taken"</i>. It doesn't make sense if the higher your HQ level, the further your eLoS will fall while the higher the requirement will rise. If the requirement rises, then the eLoS must has yet to take HQ level into consideration during calculation.

My third point is: where the hell is the button for saving a new thread in the Monobook skin? I have an uncanny feeling that Wikia devs are slowly trying to supplant the Monobook skin by causing us users such inconvenience.
*P/S: I'll try a variation with the fleet above by removing one of Akitsumaru's Reppuu and replacing it with a radar.<ac_metadata title="Regarding the brancing rule of 6-2&#039;s node F" related_topics="World 6: 中部海域"> </ac_metadata>
