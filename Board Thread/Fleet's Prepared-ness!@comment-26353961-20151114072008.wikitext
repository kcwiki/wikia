[[File:RES.png|thumb]][[File:Looks_smaller_than_I_remember.png|thumb]][[File:Subst.png|thumb]][[File:Quips.png|thumb]]I really understimated the Summer heat. I had no problem clearing the Spring event in hard mode so I got all cocky and went full retard hard mode during Summer just to drop it down to easy for E-7 (Goodbye, e-peen medal. Goodbye, Mizuho).Â 



Is this fleet good enough for full-hard mode (more worried about res tbh)? I just can't estimate the difficulty due to only experiencing both one of the easiest and the hardest events.

Should I:

Use all 3 expeditions for buckets or is one enough?

Stop 5-4 runs? The cost is negligible but I know I can't keep up my rank during the event.
