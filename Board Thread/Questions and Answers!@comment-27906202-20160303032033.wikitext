To all Wikia Contributors out there,

Recently I'm having a really complicated problem during log-in. The page said I need to change my password, but due to reasons I totally forgot the password of the e-mail I used to register in DMM, so I'm thinking of changing my e-mail to my recently used e-mail.



However, this is what I got after I followed all the procedure in [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:365755 this thread]and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:368353 this one too].

Does this means I really can't access my account? Help, I don't want to leave my grown-up shipgirls behind...
