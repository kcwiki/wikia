Seeing as how there's only a few days left until this large scale event, I would love some recommendations on how to get the most out of what I have currently.

'''Resources: 33682 Fuel | 35634 Ammo | 36985 Steel | 38302 Bauxite | 279 Buckets'''

My goal is to hopefully clear '''easy '''mode.

'''Current status:''' Running constant exped 2 for buckets, daily construction for LBAA, leveling Myoukou class. I have enough medals for 1 BP.

'''Time:''' I have a school schedule, so I can only get on in the afternoon.

'''Questions:''' How well could I do? What should I aim for resource-wise? What equipment do I really need? Who should I use a BP on? Which ships are best recommended to level in what little time is left?<ac_metadata title="Easy Mode Life"> </ac_metadata>
