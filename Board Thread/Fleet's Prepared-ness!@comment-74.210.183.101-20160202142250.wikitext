Hi, i started playing Kancolle in december. I am at the moment HQ 93. This will be my first event. So i want to know if i'm good to go.

I know i'm lacking Ooyodo, CAV and Akashi. And working with daily to get reppu/shikiden kai2 and ryuusei kai.

Im currently working on leveling Ashigara,Kasumi,Kaga,Kiso,Naka and Ise(once 50 i will level Hyuuga) Trough 4-3 farming focus on Kasumi.
