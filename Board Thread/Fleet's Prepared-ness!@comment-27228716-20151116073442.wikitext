Hello guys.

I'm wondering if I can clear this event on easy, with occasional medium maps.

Here are my ships and planes.

[https://gyazo.com/6552d7adb74feb44730e8a09855806f7 Fighters], [https://gyazo.com/e5147b90541bf93748eb9458e9133503 Dive Bombers], [https://gyazo.com/3e559354d4dbde44eb8a61fd0711c5c4 Torpedo Bombers].

My resources are 40k/40k/50k/30k and 208 buckets.

I'd be glad to be adviesd on what I should be working on as well.

Sorry if I mess up my english because it's not my first language.

Thank you.<ac_metadata title="Event readiness check please."> </ac_metadata>
