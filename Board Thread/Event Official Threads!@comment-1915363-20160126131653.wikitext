This thread have been opened since the last two events in order to obtain information pertaining the event bosses, due to the fact that their information are no longer accessible from the master data from [[Summer 2015 Event]] onwards. This thread still fulfils that purpose for any potential new enemies introduced in the upcoming event.

For this season however, we will be enforcing our preference for API calls over screenshot pictures due to the issues with the latter as stated by [[Thread:388672#7|Hayashi H]]:
*Inappropriate cropping by people who don't know what they're doing, leaving important info like enemy formation type out.
*Inability to distinguish between identical looking but functionally different ships, like {{ShipBattleCardKai|Standard Carrier Wo-Class/Kai Flagship IV}} and {{ShipBattleCardKai|Standard Carrier Wo-Class/Kai Flagship}}, especially if not in the flagship position, or PT Imp Packs variant I and II.
*Taking a ton of space on Mediawiki to hold on all the images, while API calls are text-only.

For this reason, this thread will be more focused on instructing the players how to record the API calls, such as kcsapi/api_req_sortie/battle.

Some links to get you started on how to obtain API information in order to help wiki out:
