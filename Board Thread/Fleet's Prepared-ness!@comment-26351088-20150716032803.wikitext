Before encountering this thread, I like to think that I am prepared to tackle Summmer Event, but seeing that many people's fleet do not seem as ready as they initially seemed, I figure I should post my fleets to get inputs from you guys on which areas I can improve on to be able to (hopefully) clear it on hard difficulty, so here goes: (and thanks in advance!)

(F)BB(V)s:
Nagato (86)
Mutsu (85)
Kongou k2 (92)
Hiei k2 (90)
Haruna k2 (95)
Kirishima k2 (95)
Fuso k2 (83)
Yamashiro k2 (82)

low leveled : Hyuuga 41, Ise 35, Italia 31, Bismarck 38 (no BP for em) -- figure I can level em abit and use them on earlier maps if really necessary.
