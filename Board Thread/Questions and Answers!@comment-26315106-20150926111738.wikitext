Hey, I just got Shoukaku to 80 and I was wondering if I should remodel her right away. I got one blueprint and can still get 2 medals this month.

I already did Tone, Yamashiro, Katsuragi

I am also considering Unryuu and Abukuma, I'm not so interested in the others at the moment (Choukai, Fusou, Chikuma, Littorio)

Still waiting for Bismarck...Â 

So what do you think? I really like Shoukaku but it feels a bit sudden, maybe I should wait a bit before using it?<ac_metadata title="Blueprint advice"> </ac_metadata>
