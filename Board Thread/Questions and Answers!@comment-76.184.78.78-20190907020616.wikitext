I've tried both the KC3kai and just going through DMM both of which worked fine, but everytime it gets to the title sceen when i click the game start button it doesnt do anything. The button will light up when my mouse is over it but nothing else. I've used KC3 for a long time and the last time was during the spring 2019 event so I'm not sure something changed. I've tried looking this up but i cant find any threads anywhere with this problem.<ac_metadata title="I get to the title sceen but the game start button doesnt work"> </ac_metadata>
