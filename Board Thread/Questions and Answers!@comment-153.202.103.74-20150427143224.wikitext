Hey guys, i cant enter any battles, whether its pvp or normal pve... the game just freezes before the battle starts, at the blue backrop and sometimes at the formation selection... i've tried refreshing it many times, but it always ends up the same... i can go for expeditions and select quests no problem... this only happens when im about the enter battle... any suggestions?<ac_metadata title="Problem with battle screen"> </ac_metadata>
