Hi guys, i'm new to this wikia and also have been wanting to try the game out. I tried the lottery but failed several times. i followed the instructions by changing the cookies to be able to connect to the server without any VPN. i manage to get into the lottery everytime but i just get stuck on the "you got into the lottery. please refresh every 5mins" page. i always clear my cache before refreshing every 5mins but the same thing repeats itself. and always 15mins after the start of the lottery i get fed up, relog, and find that the lottery is already over and servers are full.. can i get some help here?<ac_metadata title="What have I been doing wrong for the lottery?"> </ac_metadata>
