Ok, so a friend of mine said that he made the mistake of clearing 5-4, and that if I unlock it, I should not clear it for ranking points purposes. I just unlocked it, but I still dont get quite much about the idea. Is it better to not clear it for getting more rank points? in that case, until which node should i stop the sortieing? Or should I give a fk about the advice of my friend?<ac_metadata title="Is it wrong to clear 5-4?"> </ac_metadata>
