Last event I managed 1st Med/2nd half Easy, this time around hoping to go as few maps as possible on medium this time around since I've been focused on expanding my fleet diversity. I've listed the ships I have in training and any rarer ships I have on hand, please assume I have the common drops. I'm mostly looking for advice on which ships to level if I want to go all hard (I know my Kaga needs work at least...). Let me know if there's any additional info anyone needs!
