Hello, i started playing in may this year, i did summer event all the way easy aside from E3 that i managed to do on medium.
Can you give me your opinion about my fleet preparedness and give me some advices about what i should prioritize to prepare further please ?

I also have Akashi Kai and a lot of screws but what should i upgrade first ?

Currently i am leveling DDs and CLs with a CVL on 3-2a ( not ideal i know )
