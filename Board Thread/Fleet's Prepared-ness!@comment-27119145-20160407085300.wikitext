Okay so i think ill just do the Event on Easy/Normal and i hope u guys might have some tips what i should do in those days before it starts..Â 

My plan is to lvl up the Fuso to lvl 80 (Since ive BPs ready) and maybe Kirishima or Nagato to lvl 75 (Or both) While i do that some DDs will get some more lvls too ( I plan to have some more DDs arround 50-60 for now) Same goes for Choukai and Furutaka so ive some more CA for the early stage cause of Shiplocking..

Most Likely my biggest problem will be that i never really lvled a CV much wich ill do later (After the Event) so i hope i somehow can manage.

Any yes i do have some Repuu, Shiden K2, Suisei / Model 12A, Ju 87C Kai, Ryuusei and Saiun.. Somehow my Showcase doesnt show me any of those so i write it down.[[File:Ss_(2016-04-07_at_10.40.47).png|thumb]][[File:Ss_(2016-04-07_at_10.44.46).png|thumb]]<ac_metadata title="Ready for Easy/Normal Mode? 2016 Spring Event"> </ac_metadata>
