Just found a good way to level DD after HQ80!!!! Teitoku!! get ready!!

Guys follow my idea u won't regret !!!! 

Use this team :

1. DD(flag)

2. SSV ( equip with 2 zuiun) 

3. SSV ( 2 zuiun too!)

4. ??

*the 4th slot is the most important one*

What i experienced was, 80% chance that enemy SS will attack the 4th slot ship! collect all useless DD and put them in 4th slot!

Now, question is , i have 97 kantai waifus now and all of them are important to me. How the fuck should i get useless DD for leveling in 1-5A. 

But now problem solved.

First, get 3-4 SS swim in map 1-1, DD drop rate is incredibly high there. Just farm there!

Take those useless DDs to battle until red HP. Then eat them wakkakakakakaka!!! Then use SS to farm those DDs in map 1-1 again. :D

keep repeating this until u satisfy with ur DD level! 




Best of luck :D<ac_metadata title="About leveling DD after HQ lvl80 in map 1-5 A , THE CHEAPEST WAY"> </ac_metadata>
