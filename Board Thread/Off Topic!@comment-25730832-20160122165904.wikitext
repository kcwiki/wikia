As title said. This is an extension from the Update thread to prevent the page from being filled with off-topic stuffs.

Said thread:Â http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:387539

Don't you go post anything related to US ship (this discussion) there. If it shows up after Mikado's post, it'll get remove.

Extended: Try not to post anything related to US ship in the [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/16inch_Triple_Gun_Mount_Mk.7 Gun Page] too. Drop it all here.

'''Note:''' And I mean DISCUSSING. If you try to insult (via racist, sexist, any -ist you named it you PC people) another person rather than replying to them then I'm going to erase your post.

'''So what is your opinion on this?'''

If I recall correctly, this game is called "Kantai Collection" and not "Axis Kantai Collection". And I was never a fan of judging your girl from which country they fought-on/built-/remodeled-from. I also want that feeling of completion and I'm pretty accepting to new stuffs so....I don't care.

If I feet neutral with the girl, I'll keep her. If I like the girl, I'll raise her up. It's as simple as that.

And as I said in previous post: "If US ships wear pantyhose and ponytail then I'm a happy guy." <ac_metadata title="Threads for &quot;discussing&quot; about how you feel regarding possible implementation of US ship"> </ac_metadata>
