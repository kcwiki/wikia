So I was the first among my friends to be able to play KanColle. After that, since my 2 friends wanted to play as well, I participated in the lottery and both got them their tickets. I also checked if they worked for both of their accounts, and as expected, there wasn't any problem.

But then, one among them said that she couldn't get into KanColle. She said that she managed to click onto the "Game Start" button, but then all she gets is the floating ship and...nothing else. Not even the tutorial. She wasn't even able to get in the game even though she got her ticket. I told her to change browsers, do the bypassing process all over again, use the launcher for Chrome, and even clear her cookies, but the situation doesn't change. Just a few moments ago I told her to try and clear her cache, and that's the last thing I'll ever come up with. She said that she's been stuck like this for a month already.

If any of you could give us some suggestions on how to fix this, we'd really appreciate it. Thanks for reading.<ac_metadata title="Some connection problem..."> </ac_metadata>
