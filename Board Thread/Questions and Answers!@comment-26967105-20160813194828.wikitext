I was forced to reset my password because of alleged "injustice?" (google translate) in my account. I entered my registered email address and waited for the reset email which never came. I use yahoo mail (which is horribly bad, i know). I dont know japanese so I cant call them for help. Is there anything i can do??Â <ac_metadata title="Unable to access DMM account!!
