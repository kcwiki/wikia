Is the following statement true?

<pre>
In some map, one may want to intentionally reduce fleet's air power in order to avoid Air Parity by obtaining Air Incapability (Not Denial), so that Night Reconn can be triggered.

For instance in 6-1 before implementation of Aircraft Proficiency system, with 1CV1CL1CLT3SS, loading only one fighter plane to a mildly small slot of the carrier could result in Air Superiority en route buy Air Incapability at boss and thus increase the rate of S win at boss node during yasen for the monthly 3 times 601 S-win mission.
