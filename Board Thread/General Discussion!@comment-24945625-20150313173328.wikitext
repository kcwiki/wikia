This is a somewhat mind-breaking issue for me... I mean, getting to level 100 HQ means I will be facing a lot more stronger enemies both during normal sorties and event times, sigh~ I don't want to play this game with the pressure that I will have to keep polishing my fleets and equips all day everyday from now on, but it does not feel like things will be fine from here on if I just play the way how I normally play... > <" (currently lvl 99, but I know I will be there sooner than I would expect)
