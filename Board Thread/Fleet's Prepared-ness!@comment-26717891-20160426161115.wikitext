After more than a Year I think I'm finally psychologically ready for an All Hard Marathon...three times I tried and three times I chickened out at the last stage.

Problem is, am I also Physically ready?

Or it's better to pack already and resign to a mixed clear again?

Time is running dry, so I wondered if veterans/people surely more competent than me had any interesting and useful suggestion... 

I tried to paste all the relevant infos in just two pictures, hope it's clear enough
