Currently, most of the ship classes in game have a short 2-3 character long classification symbol like CL mean Light Cruiser and CA mean Heavy Cruiser and most of these symbols are drawn from USA's Hull classification symbol. This leave a hole for ship classes that do not have their corresponding classification in that systen nade by USA and yet  people would still give a shortform to those ship classes that appear in this game for simpler typing and display in smaller space. One of auch affected ship class is Training Cruiser which people commonly call it as CLp or CT nowaday.

:So, simply speaking, '''Which do you think we should use in this wikia to represent Training Cruiser, CLp or CT?'''

:'''CLp'''： The symbol currently used in most wikia pages, form by adding the character p from practice after CL, but it is a mix of cap and noncap character

:'''CT'''： The symbol used in some other place, form by putting the character T for training after C for cruiser juat like how the codes CL, CA and CV were formed in history, but it might draw a bit confusion against CLT.

So what's your opinion about whoch one would be better to label Training Cruiser? Or do you think there are some other better opinion? Please freely express your opinion below. <ac_metadata title="What classification symbol should we use for Training Cruiser (i.e. Katori) ?"> </ac_metadata>
