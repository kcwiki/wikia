Hey there boys and girls,
Spring Event 2015 is kicking in soon and with that many tears, salt and drops are gonna rain on us ~pyon.<br>
Our contestant Zelphegor the Melon Lord in short Zel-Melon-san,one of the most beloved and honored mods of our wikia, is playing for 6 months and managing meanwhile the wiki,a hard job to be honest.<br>
During his career as Teitoku he successfully cleared all worlds until 6-2 and also completed Winter Event 2015 ~pyon.<br> 
With all his good deeds, [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Uzuki|"Uzuki"] still denied her audience to Melon Lord Zelphegor. But that does not falter his <b>WILL</b> ~pyon.<br>
Is he now finally able to obtain the so longed rabbit everyone loves ~pyon? <br>
Zel gets now a good chance to obtain her during spring event and end this streak of unrequired love.<br>
And its our turn to boost his moral (or crush his last piece of hope...).<br> Vote in the poll your opinion if zel is gonna get uzuki and also post some nice(or less nice) comments to encourage him further(or send him packing home) !!!
<br>
