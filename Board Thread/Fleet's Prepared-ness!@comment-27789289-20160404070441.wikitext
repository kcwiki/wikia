Hello!

Sorry if this might be (lengthy, idk), my plans for this spring due to IRL stuff is MAINLY if Yuu drops farm the crap out of her, and beat Spring 2016 in a mix of easy/norm depending on rewards due to said IRL stuff.

Currently, HQ lvl 100, (after many attempted Taihou and Yamasushi attempts) gave up and gathering resources (for real), and ATM resources are:

Fuel:16k, Ammo: 13k, Steel: 68k, Bauxite: 12k. Buckets: 900 (Much luck many wow on exped 2 nowdays.)

Fleet rooster and equips (Sorry IDK how to post those pics without links, would like to know how you do that with Puu.sh or any other way.):

Currently, by the time spring event starts, I should have at least 1 skilled Lookouts due to a DD that i have wich will remodel soon whom has it as stock equip, and I think i need to get more Daihatsu, but the next few BP's go to Bismy and Tone/Chikuma and Fusou, due to equipment, and overall need (as you can see Ise/Hyuuga arent high lvl, and i just finished lvling Hiei, Kirishima, 4 Muykou sis, Tone+Chikuma, Kiso to thier Kai Ni remodel lvls (and remodel who i could, aswell as Bismy.)

Im also debiating, since i dont have many "Good" fighter planes if to try to get more Reppu/Shinden Kai planes, due to only having like only 4 10+ AA fighters.

ship wise, the "best" 6 DD's they showcase dont show the other DD's i have, i managed to get Shigure to Kai Ni by today, and also lvling Kawakaze and Ooshio (due to rumers, jsut to be safe).

CAV wise i KNOW im lacking on that front, I'm doing my best to rush either Tone/Chikuma and give either this month's BP to them, or save the BP and the next 1 to insta remodel Bismy to Drei. thats still on debate due to CAV lack.

Equipment wise, I'm debaiting wetehr to upgrade proto 41, or focus more on Daihatsu, since its a new equipment that will have (prolly) impact on next event.

Any tips/ improments i should do as it is?Â <ac_metadata title="Fleet state before Spring 2016."> </ac_metadata>
