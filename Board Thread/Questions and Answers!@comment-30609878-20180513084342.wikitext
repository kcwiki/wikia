I just realizied I do not have Akitsushima for some reason but I did not know it until now. Maybe I am missing even more shipgirls who I am not aware of.

Is there a way to get a list of all ships currently available substracted by all ships I already have? Preferably an automatic generatable list... ^^

I also use K3C, so if that has one way to show sucha list, I will be okay as well. (Help pages did not give a hint though or I overread it)<ac_metadata title="How to get a list of all missing shipgirls?"> </ac_metadata>
