Hello gais, I'm a new ttk who started the journey on 4 March 2016, 2nd month in the game and this is my first event I've ever participated (my friend told me "First event being a total war? Sucks to be you kek"), and I'm really worried about not being able to even clear easy to obtain Iowa (like I really want her). Is it possible for me to clear through easy to obtain her? Thank you very much for the guidance! I appreciate it!
