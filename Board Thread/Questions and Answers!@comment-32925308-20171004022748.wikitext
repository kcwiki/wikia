Approximately 4 days ago i purchased 1000 dmm points, the charges showed up on transactions as usual, so i figured it would go through. Except they didn't this time and unfortunately i just barely noticed that the charges were missing from my account, heck i still have the same available balance too. I really don't want to be banned for this, so what exactly do i do in this situation?<ac_metadata title="DMM Charges Vanished From Bank Transactions" related_topics="Shop/Purchasing"> </ac_metadata>
