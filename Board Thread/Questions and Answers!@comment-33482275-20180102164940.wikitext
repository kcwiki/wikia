Good Day Caps,



After countless weeks of searching and attempts to find the right balance to lvl my Ships, i have to ask you guys.

My HQ lvl is 74 at the moment and i want to know what do i need to survive the next Big Event or even have a chance to take part of it?

What are the requirements (best possible HQ lvl, Equipment)?

Which Ship Typ should i lvl and how high should the lvl be?

How much Ships of each Shiptyp should i have leveled? More DD's, CL's or CLT's?

Or should i focus more on lvl my BB's, CV/L's and CA's?

At the moment i try to lvl all DD's which have a KAI NI form ('''who doesn't need a Blue Print)Â '''to lvl 30 in World 1-5 bevor my HQ is above lvl 80. Same for all CL's and CLT's.



If Prinz Eugen or Graf should be able to collect in the next big event, i will try it no matter what! If this isn't the case however, then i have no problem to ignore it.
