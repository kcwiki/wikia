I have a tablet I basically just use for Kancolle, however it's ~3yrs old now and is starting to slow down a bit and struggles to even play KC full speed sometimes - plus the screen is no exactly always responsive now lol, making combined fleets very hard. (It was cheap at the time tbh lol but I'm very much considering buying the new version because its still cheap and has better specs now, and if I get another three years from it that'l do me lol)

However, how easy is it to transfer your data/the game across? Can I just do the hoop jumping DMM thing, download the game again and sign in to get my data? Or would i have to stick a memory card in and see if I can put it on there.<ac_metadata title="Transfer data to new Tablet?"> </ac_metadata>
