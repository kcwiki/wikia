<p style="margin-bottom:1em;color:rgb(0,0,0);margin-top:0px!important;">I know there's 3 days left but let's face it, some of us finished the event since the first week (or 3-4 days). Most of us spent our time in E-7 (aka farming for chicks) so I'm expecting more tasty drops due to how many rare drops are presented this event is (''except Akizuki and Prinz because butts are OP'').</p>
