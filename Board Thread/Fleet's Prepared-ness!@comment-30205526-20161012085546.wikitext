Hello, I only started playing a few months ago (while the previous event was on) so this will be my first real event. I did get to do a bit of e1 while the previous event was on, and got a few ships but I wasn't able to prepare for it or clear any of the maps.

From what I understand the next event will likely be in November, so I'm looking for some advice on what to focus on with the time remaining before the event. I have read shinwalee's event guide, as well as various other guides, and browsed other peoples threads in the fleet prepared-ness section and compared them to my own.

Mainly I'm after advice on whether I should focus more on hoarding resources or levelling my ships (or a mix of the two) as well as any key area's im lacking in which I can shore up before the event. As i've said i'm a new player so I don't have a big stockpile of resources, at the time of writing this I have basically 15k of everything (fuel/ammo/steel/baux) and 230 buckets. The buckets i'm not worried about, as I do expedition 2 all day and am hardly using any at the moment so I should hit the 4 or 5 hundred mark hopefully.

I'll post my fleet and equipment before I go any further so you can see what I've got to work with.

Anyway so that's what I've got ship and equipment wise. At the bare minimum before the event I intend to do the following,

Yukikaze & ayanami to 50

Maya to kai 2, (working on her atm)

and get Zuikaku to 50+ (only got her yesterday)

but besides those goals I'm not really sure what to work on.

Fusou is also almost kai ni but I only have 3 medals at the moment, I haven't attempted to clear 3-5 or 4-5 yet though, and I have 1 more quest that gives a medal avaliable soon so I could probably get another BP before the event if needed.

Basically I've tried to level a number of each class to level 50 and then once I reached that milestone, I've started to kai ni the high priority ones.

For the event itself obviously I'd like to clear it on at least easy mode, as well as possibly doing some of the earlier maps on medium/hard if the rewards are worth it and the map is easy enough.

I also want to absolutely farm the crap out of all the event only ships avaliable, including possibly multipe copies if some of the ships avaliable have rare valuable equipment like u511 or such. I also want to farm ships that are (easier?) to get from the event if avaliable like ooyoodo (1-6 is just so depressing), i401 and such.

Basically I want to get the absolute maximum out of the event that I can, I'm just a bit confused about how to go about that. Should I basically halt all levelling and just do the basic daily's and weeklies orel cruising and do sparkled expeditions all day and just hoard resources and hardly play the game at all over the following month. Or should I continue fairly intense levelling and get a few more ships to kai ni and go into the event with less resources avaliable but higher levelled ships that will make me retreat less?

I'm quite happy to do either of the two, I'm just after some advice from the more experienced admirals on what they'd reccomend.

Thank you.<ac_metadata title="First Event Help"> </ac_metadata>
