After the end of the Event, I managed to clear all my objectives (Prinz,Akizuki,Graf and many more) but this came at a heavy price, my hard earned buckets melted like snow in the middle of Arizona in a particular hot day. 450-->0 to be exact.

Now the Winter event approaches without pity or remorse, and I'm wondering, how can you people stack something in the order of the four digit buckets?

I'm spamming Exped 2/13 and doing the daily quests, but in the end it amounts to nothing more than 5-6 buckets a day (including those spent in clearing the various X-5 stages for blueprints)

Do you have any other suggestion to rack a copious amount of buckets fast?

Any answer is humbly accepted, and thanks in advance for the time you spent replying
