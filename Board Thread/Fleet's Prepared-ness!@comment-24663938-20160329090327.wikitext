I'm a new player (HQ Level 55), and a friend of mine who's been playing longer than I have has told me that if I beefed up my fleet hard, I have a good shot on doing the event on Easy at least, as long as they're at least Lv 40. However, I'm not sure whether that's achievable, especially given the time I have left. What do you think? Here's my top 40 ships:

Also, my resources are as follows: 13313 fuel, 13170 ammo, 17601 aluminium, 11078 bauxite; 175 buckets, 132 dev materials, 141 blowtorches

So what do you think? Do I have a chance? Do I keep grinding on 1-5 and 3-2? How far would I get? I'm eager to aim for Iowa but I'm really concerned about what I currently have and I just want to hear your advice for how I'd do and what I should do.<ac_metadata title="How&#039;d my fleet do on Easy?"> </ac_metadata>
