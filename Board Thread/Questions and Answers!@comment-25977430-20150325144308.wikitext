This is a question for a player with rly high level ships.

Can you please tell me what to expect from a fleet of level 150 Destroyers? Specifically, how would they perform in 3-5 south?

Doing it with level 80 Â Ayanami, Poi, Beaver, Shimakaze and Boilerkaze (+Yahagi), and it's total fuckathron to say the least.

Is this Salt going on all the way, or it becomes somewhat easier (and if - to what extent) once i have them all at level 150?

I am just wandering if it's worth to get rings for girls for better performance, or it's the same shit as if they were lvl 99.



Thank You.<ac_metadata title="lvl 150 Ship vs. lvl 80 one ... a question about performance difference."> </ac_metadata>
