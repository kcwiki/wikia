Hey Guys and Girls,

I've started playing around 3 months ago, so this is my first event. I'm still not shure which difficulty I should go for and I am searching in regard to that some advice.

Well let's get to my fleet:

And my Equipment: http://i.imgur.com/dcZSmfu.png

My mats are 6k/8k/24k/9k from leveling and my Buckets are at 162 from beating 5-3...

I tend to just farming mats and buckets until the event, unless I should level up some more specific ships. I have in mind of getting Kaga to around lvl 70~ and crafting a few fighter planes. 



So far from my side, I hope some of you experienced guys could help me out.
