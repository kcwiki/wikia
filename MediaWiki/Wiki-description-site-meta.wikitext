Welcome to the Kancolle Wiki! Kantai Collection, also known as Kancolle, is a online browser game in which one assumes the role of an admiral, assembles a fleet of kanmusu ("ship girl", girls based on World War II era Japanese ships and submarines) and battles against fleets of alien enemy warships. This wiki is a place to find English information about the game and tutorials on how to play even if you don't know Japanese.
