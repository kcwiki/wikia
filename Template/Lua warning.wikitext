{{Warning|This is a Lua based template, there is an upper bound on the number of times Lua templates can be used on a page without breaking it (since the change in [[Thread:457712|Wikia Lua engine in July 2016]], the previous engine had a greater limit and only caused Lua script errors at worst).}}<noinclude>Only use this warning for Lua based templates that can be overused (example: [[Template:EquipmentLink]], not an example: [[Template:ShipInfoKai]]).</noinclude>
