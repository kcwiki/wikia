;Description
:This template is used for inserting expansible sections, spoiler-like menus into articles. 
:The main use of this template is in [[Tutorial: FAQ]] page.
:Automatically generate wiki header level 3 for table of contents but edit link does not work.
;Syntax
:Fill in the form
<pre>{{Expansible
|id=<ID>
|header=<header>
|content=<content>
}}</pre>
;Notes:
:<code><nowiki><ID></nowiki></code> field must be unique within an article. Assignment of this field is optional. If multiple report templates are assigned the same ID, they will be linked and collapse/expand together.
:By default the template uses timestamp id but manual assignment might be necessary in some cases.
:<span style="color:red">Blank space and some special characters are not allowed in the ID. If the template doesn't expand, check your ID first.</span>
:To use nested tables and tabbers in the template, replace all instances of <code><nowiki>"|"</nowiki></code> (pipe character) with <code><nowiki>"{{!}}"</nowiki></code>
