[[File:4-1 Map.jpg|thumb|400x400px]]
This map is similar to 3-2 as it is a multi-purpose map that can train all types of ships. Exp is lower than 3-2 but it compensates by having 2 farmable nodes. This can increase the rate of leveling and also helps with fatigue.

<u>Guide:</u>

Setup for this map is similar to 3-2 however be sure to bring ASW due to the SS in nodes B and G. The optimal formation is Line ahead on first node, Line abreast on second node. There is a chance that you may be sent to I. Refresh the game if you do not intend to take damage or continue if you dislike using refresh.

The skeleton setup is
* Ship you intend to level
* At least 1 BB(V) for 2<sup>nd</sup> shelling
* At least 3 ASW capable ships

* At least 1 SS for tanking
Examples:

DD, BB, CVL, CVL, CLT, SS

CA, BB, CVL, CVL, DD, SS

BB, CVL, CVL, DD, CLT, SS

<u>Tips:</u>
* Enemy have no Air Power, no fighters needed (except for boss node)
* Using CVL is recommended as it eliminates enemies that harm your SS and they can also clear enemy SS in the 2<sup>nd</sup> node.
* Do not use Seaplane Bombers as they will direct attacks from your BBV/CAV towards SS
* CLT are recommended as they are guarantee to take out an enemy as well as participate in ASW
* Node I (Southern path) has Strong enemy BB, so it can be advisable to end sortie after one node if you go SW to node E.
* You may advance with a red SS if you have enough bombers to completely eliminate the enemy before shelling in the second node. There is still a chance for your SS to sink and the probability is determined by your bombers and luck. Advance at your own risk.
* There is a low chance of 1 CA in the first node so keep in mind that you may take some damage.
<u>Pros:</u>
* 2 farmable nodes

* SS can tank
<u>Cons:</u>
* There may be 1 CA in the first node

* Slightly lower Exp than 3-2
* More difficult to control MVP.
