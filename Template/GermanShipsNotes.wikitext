Currently, it is possible to construct {{ShipLink|Bismarck}} and/or {{ShipLink|Z3}} WITHOUT the completion of the {{ShipLink|Z1}} [[Z1#Notes|quest chain]], but with {{ShipLink|Z1}} obtained from drop (e.g. from [[4-5]])<sup>[http://nga.178.com/read.php?tid=8723922 [1]][https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/3z3y63/achievementit_turns_out_you_dont_need_to_have_the/ [2]]</sup>.<br>
