This is an attempt to gather fleet composition reports on <span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">[[{{{Eventseason|Winter 2016 Event}}}/{{{Eventmap|E-1}}}]]</span> into one thread rather than having them lost in the pages of the [[{{{Eventseason|Winter 2016 Event}}}]] comments.

* Instruction of how to use this template is [[Template:EventComp|here]].
* If you have [[:User_blog:Dragonjet/KC3%E6%94%B9|KC3æ”¹]], you can export your fleet compositions easily via going through KC3 Kai's strategy room > Fleets > Export. Copy and paste the data into your response.
:* If your fleet composition replies causes a "script error" message, please edit your post to include <nowiki><pre></nowiki> at the first line and <nowiki></pre></nowiki> at the last line of your fleet composition.
* [[:Kancolle_Wiki:Staff|Admins and Moderators]] may edit or remove posts that contain template mishaps or intentional attempts to break the mechanism.

'''What should not be posted here'''
