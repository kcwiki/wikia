<h2>Hi there!</h2>
[[Image:Example.jpg|thumb|Welcome!]]
'''Welcome to this Wikia, and thank you for your contributions! [[Special:UserLogin|We invite you to log in and create a user name.]]'''

[[Help:Why create an account|Creating a user name]] is free and takes only a minute ''and'' it gives you greater '''anonymity''' if that is your wish. In addition, it is easier for other contributors to ask you questions and help you.

*Of course, we hope you continue to make contributions, even if not logged in.
*If you are new to Wikia or wikis in general, please visit the [[Project:Community Portal|Community portal]] for an outline of some of the main parts of the site and links to pages that show you how to edit.
*Discussion of any aspect of the site, and enquiries, can be made at the [[Forum:Index|Forum]] or on the [[Help:Talk pages|"discussion" page]] associated with each article. Please [[Help:Signature|sign and date]] your contributions there, so that readers know "who to talk to" and whether your message is probably still of current interest.
