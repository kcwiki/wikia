==Syntax==
*''Ship'' is the ship's name. For example, "Sendai".
*''Model'' is the ship's remodel. This may be "", "Kai", "Kai Ni", "A", "Carrier", "Carrier Kai", "Carrier Kai Ni", "zwei" or "drei".
*''LoS'' is the ship's base Line of Sight stat '''without''' equipment.
*''Equip'' is an equipment from the list of guns [[Sandbox/EquipmentListByType|here]].
;Additional Variables
*''!hq'' is the player's HQ level.
*''!route'' is the route the player took. This is passed in as-is, so you may format it however you wish (eg. "A-B/C-D/E" or "A-B-D or A-C-E").
*''!difficulty'' is the difficulty selected. This is passed in as-is, but for clarity's sake, you should use "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard".
*''!drops'' is a list of the ships obtained as drops from the map the fleet was sortied. This is a list of ship name '''without their models''', separated by forward slashes. For example, "!drops=Akizuki/Prinz Eugen/Akashi/Taigei".
