[[File:World_1-5.jpg|right|400px|World 1-5]]
A relatively easy map. Low XP gain so used early on or for DD/CL which are cheaper to sortie.

<u>Suggested Composition</u>: 4+ DD/CL (Other classes can be included as well but you should include some ASW capable ships to improve ranking).

<u>Equipment</u>: Focus on ASW equipment such as sonars and depth charges as you will only face SS.

<u>Guide:</u>
*The first three nodes are relatively easy and it is recommended that you end after 3 nodes. Use formation Line Abreast.
* 4 or less ships will head to C; more than that will be random. C/D does not matter much if you are just leveling.
* The boss node can be reached with a fleet of up to 4 ships, with two or less CL and no SS or BB (BBV are allowed and will provide a second shelling phase). Including CVL/AV/CAV/LHA will guarantee routing to boss; having none will make routing random between boss and node G.
*Non-boss nodes except A/B/C/D contain very powerful ship thus you won't want to go there when leveling unless you have too many buckets/resources spare to repair your ships.
*This map can also serve as slightly cheesy (and somewhat hilarious) way to easily train low-level SS that can't really fend for themselves, like Maruyu. Simply toss it into the 1-5 hamster wheel and run the first three nodes. Naturally, you will technically lose all three but gain 945 XP for doing absolutely nothing while staying safe and positive on morale, which, in turn, allows you to run the hamster wheel ad nausea. D ranks also don't drop anything, if that annoys you. This method may cause your PvE rating to dip slightly if used too much, but a single sparkling session will easily even it out.

<u>Tips:</u>
*All the non dead end nodes are composed of SS.
*F and G are dead end nodes that have strong enemy ships.
*Use the formation Line Abreast as this is the strongest ASW formation. (Requires a minimum of 4 ships)
*Third node has the possibility to drop SS with S rank.
*Going to boss node allows more chances to drop SS. However this also gives a lot of HQ XP, which can make it difficult later as extra operations often increase in difficulty according to HQ level, and it can also severely limit the amount of sortie you can use 1-5 to level your ships before enemy ships become more hazardous and dangerous to your ships.
*From HQ level 40-80, some would opt to utilize only the first node for leveling, in order to completely avoid the need of repairing ships due to damages done by preemptive attack of enemy subs and also it can lower morale of non-flagship ships quickly (with proper selection of equipment combination and accompanying ships base on their range parameter) and thus help in securing flagship's MVP despite there are only one target.
*After level 80, the first node will contain an enemy submarine that will launch an opening torpedo strike.  It will be likely to damage your ships, dramatically decreasing efficiency. However, some might choose to continue leveling their ships here by using decoy ships.
**With the introduction of the preemptive ASW strike in the June 30th, 2016 update, TTKs with HQ level 80+ may consider using 1-5A to level any DD or CL that can achieve 100+ ASW. At least four ships should be used to enable Line Abreast. While tedious, rotating and scrapping decoy ships means that leveling one ship this way is extremely cheap. This method also saves on buckets compared to 4-3 leveling.

<u>Pros</u>: 
*Easy and simple to unlock.
*Slow to moderate morale drain.
<u>Cons</u>:
*Low Base XP.
*Boring, spent too much time here have caused some player to AFK.
*Not a good idea to level ships without anti-sub capability here. (See relevant section in [[Combat]] page for details.)
*Difficulty increases according to HQ level.

<u>Notes</u>: Increases in difficulty at HQ levels 40 and 80 with higher chance to get SS as drop. First node switches to Elite SS after level 80 which makes the map more difficult.
