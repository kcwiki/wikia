<b>Overview</b>:<span style="float: right;">{{Edit|Template:Leveling5-4

This map is primarily used for farming HQ Exp, however it is somewhat possible to level certain ships by modifying the standard setup. Due to branching rules, you may only level FAST ships in this map. There is another method that allow you to level SLOW ships on this map, which will be written in another section.

<b>Guide</b>:

There are many different variations to farm this map. All of them work well and it's up to your play style which one you use. Here are some examples:
*XX, FBB, 3CV, drum mule
*XX, 2FBB, 2CV, drum mule
*XX, FBB, CLT, 2CV, drum mule
Where XX is the ship you are leveling, "drum mule" is a CAV or 4 slot CL who will be carrying 4 drums.

Explanation: <br/>
There must be at least one BB for 2nd shelling in the first node. This is to ensure the Flagship CA/CL/DD are dead before the closing torpedo salvo as they have high torpedo stats.<br/>
There should be at least 1 CV if using Shiden K2 +7 and better Fighters or 2 CV if using low tier Fighters. This is to ensure AS/AS+ to enable Artillery Spotting and protect ships from Opening bombing.<br/>
There should be one ship carrying 4 drums for the sake of branching. <br/>
Any of these ships can also double as the ship you are leveling.<br/>

<b>Equipment</b>:

BB(V)/CA(V)/CL: Artillery Spotting Setup, consider AA Radar for auxiliary <br/>
CAV (if there is a DD holding 3 drums): 2 Red guns, Seaplane, Drum

CV: Enough fighters for AS+, 1 saiun, +7 planes recommended but not necessary <br/>
In case of CV stealing MVP from BB, use +0 rank planes or limit the # of bombers to 1-2 each.

DD: AA Cut-in (optional) or Drum canister

CL: Artillery Spotting (if your going for MVP) or Drum canister

<b>Tips</b>:
* This map is good for leveling ships who have difficulty obtaining MVP, particularly CA. With high base Exp, this map is one of the best way for leveling those ships.
* Considering using lower leveled CV/BB as the nodes are all pretty easy while very rewarding. This way those ships can leech exp.
* The higher powered kai-2 CA/V are reasonably effective on this map.
* Node H has the highest Air power of all nodes. AS+ requirements are of the following:
** Pattern 1: 348
** Pattern 2: 300 (suggested: 305)
** Pattern 3: 249 (alternative: 254)
***For the best performance to cost ratio, configure your CV loadout to fulfill these AS+ requirements. Higher Air power means lower damage so do some experimenting on your own to find the optimal setup for you. It typically isn't worth bringing 3 CV/L to meet AS requirements, so Kaga can be helpful to bring with her high slots.
***For reference, 220 Air power spread over four +7 Fighters (~25 Air each), seven +7 Bombers (~6 Air each), and one +7 saiun (0? Air) for the total of approx. 362+/-5% Air power will guarantee AS+ on all nodes including Pattern 1 on H. 

<b>Pros</b>:
* High base Exp
* Many rare drops
* Many CV/CVL drops for those AA modernization material
* Simultaneously farm HQ Exp
* Good place to rank up planes
<b>Cons</b>:
* Unless you're leveling a BB or CV, she is very unlikely to get MVP
* Not bucket friendly
* Requires more bauxite depending on the number of bombers fielded.  (Could be 100+ on certain setups)
