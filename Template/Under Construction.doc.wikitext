__NOTOC__
==Disclaimer==
This is a technical documentation, so proper design or information organization is not needed, as long as it able to explain the code used in the template. If you feel any difficulties on understanding the codes, feel free to ask any technical editors around.

==Description==
This template will categorize articles that include it into [[:Category:Under Construction Articles]], and mark it with an Under Construction template.

Currently, this template only supports up to 3 (three) people adopting the same article. In case there are more people needed, please contact [[User:Ethrundr|Ethrundr]] in order to expand the template to support necessary amount of people.

==Functions==
This template functionality is similar to the {{tlx|Stub}} template, but this one is preferred for the larger articles that already have considerable amount of information and just lacking some details in certain sections.

==Syntax==
Type <code>{{tlx|Under Construction|...}}</code> at the start of an article or section.
<pre>
{{Under Construction
|Scope  = <either article or section. default = article>
|Desc   = <if you want to add some description. default = missing some information.>
|Help   = <if you want to specify how people can help. default = and adding the missing information.>
|Missing Information = <add the kind of details the article is missing>
|Page Adopted   = Ethrundr         <this is the 1st user>
|Page Adopted 2 = CDRW             <this is the 2nd user>
|Page Adopted 3 = ILyn             <this is the 3rd user>}}
</pre>

Notes:
*The '''help''' part (second line of the basic template) will be gone once the page is adopted, and replaced by '''<code>The page is already being adopted and currently under renovation.</code>'''

==Notes==
#The template automatically links to the users' page, therefore <code><nowiki>[[User:]]</nowiki></code> tags are not required. Spelling of the names is case-sensitive (except for the first letter).
#Notes for Scope
#*For the scopes, here's the detailed explanation:
#**If the information that being constructed involves whole article, then the scope of the template should be '''''<u>article</u>''''', and this template must be placed at the topmost of the article page.
#**If the information that being constructed just a part of an article (section), then the scope of the template should be '''''<u>section</u>''''', and this template must be placed directly after the section header of respective section being constructed.
