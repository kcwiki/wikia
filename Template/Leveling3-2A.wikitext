An extremely safe and resource friendly node to farm on. Because all of the enemy ships for each pattern are either CL or DD, this is the perfect place to allow a sub to tank all of their attacks. This way, you only have to repair your submarine once it hits red!

<u>Suggested Compositions</u>:
* (Flagship) Whatever ship you want to level + 1~2CV(L) + 1~2Anything + 1BB(V) ï¼‹1SS
* ex: X/CV(L)/X/X/BB(V)/SS or X/CV(L)/CV(L)/X/BB(V)/SS
Note: If you're extremely low on bauxite, feel free not to use CV(L). However, make sure you take at least 1~2Strong ship(s) + 1BB(V) to secure a second shelling phase

<u>Alternate Compositions</u>:

1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G9SBVMrt6I|'''CA (Flagship) + 1BB(V) + 2CA/CL + 1CV(L) + 1SS'''] 
* This setup is for power leveling a CA and can potentially ignore morale of the supporting ships to an extent, but for the supporting CL or CA, rotating them can bring more efficiency in clearing the enemy fleet properly. 
* The BB(V) must either be fully equipped with Large or Small Surface Radars (preferably Type 32 or Type 33 Surface Radar on all slots), have a Cut-In Attack setup while being equipped with a very weak cannon (preferably 14cm, 15.5cm, or 20.3cm Cannon to match the other CA or CL support ships),  or have nothing at all. For BBV, you may add in full Seaplane to support Aerial Combat.  
* The supporting CA/CL must have Cut-In setup, as even at low morale, it can potentially one-shot kill the enemy ships with a Critical Hit while not hindering the Flagship CA from obtaining MVP.
* It is recommended that the Supporting CV(L) start out with only 2 Dive Bomber in the lowest plane slots with 1 Saiun and another Saiun or RADAR in the highest slots until it reaches Red Morale, and then you may equip 3 Dive Bomber and 1 Saiun. However even then, there are chances of the CV(L) stealing MVP from your CA flagship by random if your CA flagship fails to initiate Double Attack for both turns or if the attacks miss. 
*The Yellow (Secondary) Guns can make your supporting CL/CAs attack first before your Flagship during the 1st Shelling Phase which could get rid of the enemy fleets before the Flagship CA has a chance to attack (Usually the case when you face against the Pattern #3 Enemy Fleet). This should be taken into consideration. 
*<span style="color:red">'''WARNING'''</span>: If the Flagship CA fails to initiate Double Attack due to RNG for both 1st and 2nd Shelling Phase, consider the MVP chance lost for the Flagship CA unless Night Battle becomes involved. 

2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV1ORtWOZ-s|'''CA (FLAGSHIP) + 1 BBV + 3 CV(L) + 1SS''']
* This setup is for power leveling a CA and can potentially ignore morale of the supporting ships to an extent. 
* The supporting BBV should be equipped with a very weak Main Gun (Ex. 14cm Twin Gun Mount or 15.2 Twin Gun Mount) and a 15.5cm Triple Secondary Gun with Type 0 Recon Seaplane, and a RADAR for Day Cut-in Attack. 
* The supporting BBV may just be equipped with 4 Surface RADARs instead if preferred. 
* The supporting CV(L)s should only start with 1x Type 99 Dive Bomber on each on the lowest numbered Plane Slot (Usually the 4th last slot), while the 1st to 3rd slots are filled with RADARs with good accuracy stats (preferably Surface RADARs), Saiun, or Type 2 Recon Aircraft. 
*1 Saiun is mandatory to be equipped on one of the supporting CV(L)s. 
* The supporting CV(L)s may start equipping two Type 99 Dive Bomber or Suisei (or mix of both) after their morale becomes very low (Red Face). 
* If the CA's Firepower is Maxed, you may choose Double Line Formation. However if the CA's Firepower is not Maxed, it is recommended that you choose Line Ahead. 
* Double Line Formation helps the Supporting Ships hit the enemy even if they are in 0 morale. However, this may decrease the CA's chance of obtaining MVP due to the lower damage output. 
*<span style="color:red">'''WARNING'''</span>: If the Flagship CA fails to initiate Double Attack due to RNG for both 1st and 2nd Shelling Phase, consider the MVP chance lost for the Flagship CA unless Night Battle becomes involved. 

3. '''CV(L) (Flagship) + 4CV(L) + 1SS'''
* This setup is for power leveling a CV or CVL with nearly no rotation at all for the supporting CV(L)s excluding the SS
* Majority of the time, the enemy fleet will all be defeated during the Aerial Combat phase. 
* The Flagship CV(L) should be equipped with your best Torpedo Bombers and a 15.5cm Triple Gun Mount (Secondary) on the last slot in order to enable first attack.  
* The other supporting CV(L) should be equipped with 2-3 Suisei or Type 99 Dive Bomber with a radar at the last slot, including 1 Saiun on one of the CV(L)s.   
* You may mix Dive Bomber and Torpedo Bomber if preferred for all ships. 
* You may add in 1 BB(V) with only Radars on all slots to enable two turns of attacks while not hindering the flagship from getting MVP.
* This formation can drain bauxite a bit. 
* You may use Double Line formation to increase accuracy of your flagship's planes to hit the enemy. 

<u>Guide</u>:
* Always end the sortie once you finish node A.
* CV(L) generally run 3 Torpedo Bombers + Saiun, but if you equip too many/strong bombers, your CV(L) will be the MVP.
* Torpedo Bomber creates more higher risk in stealing MVP from your CA flagship. 
* MVP can infinitely continue to run the sortie and will not become fatigued as long as they remain MVP. (If someone else gets MVP for 1 sortie, they will become fatigued).
* When ships become fatigued, rotate other ships in to continue grinding unless they are the supporting SS or CV(L). Feel free to use a fatigued CV(L) and SS as long as it's not heavily damaged (Red).
* Always use Line Ahead formation to maximize Firepower, especially when leveling a CA as flagship.

<u>Tips</u>:
*Your other ships can still take damage during the torpedo phase if you don't lower all of the enemy fleet's ships to at least Moderately Damaged.
*It is recommended to not rotate the CV(L) and leave it at Red Morale if you want to avoid it stealing MVP from the your flagship, especially CA. 
*If you would like to level up a non-remodeled CA, it is recommended to use it as a support ship for awhile to help your flagship obtain MVP (preferably a BB(V) flagship). 

<u>Pros</u>:
*Low repair cost.
*Allows for a large freedom when choosing the composition.
*In the long run, helps other supporting ships to gain levels, especially the CV(L). 
*High experience considering it's easy difficulty.
*Will give a lot of BB, CA, and CV(L) drops to help modernizing your ships as you level them up. 

<u>Cons</u>:
*Can be tedious.
*High morale drain.
*Not optimal for DD or CL as the flagship MVP target, as they have difficulty gaining MVP. Both can be used as support ships to help the flagship obtain MVP, however.
*Non-remodeled CA flagship will somewhat have a difficult time obtaining MVP in early levels unless its Firepower is fully modernized (not recommended to modernize its firepower if the remodel level is low), and due to Double Attack not being guaranteed when the CA cannot equip a radar due to only having 3 Equipment Slots available before it is remodeled. This can be avoided if the CA starts out as a supporting ship for another flagship.
*When facing the enemy fleet with only 5 ships total, there are random situations where your CA flagship's MVP gets stolen by your CV(L) and BB(V) due to running out of enemies to fight against.
