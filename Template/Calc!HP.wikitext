A speculative table for maximal [[Modernization#de|HP modernization]] based on API (<code>api_start2</code>). For each ship form, <code>hp = api_taik[0]</code> is initial HP, which is unmarried unmodded HP, <code>hp_max = api_taik[1]</code> is an upper bound for unmarried or married and unmodded or modded HP. Unmodded married HP <code>hp_married</code> is given by a function in [[Module:ShipData]] (<code>min(hp_max, hp + [4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9][floor(hp / 10)])</code>), <code>hp < hp_married <= hp_max</code>. Thus, maximal unmarried HP bonus is <code>min(2, hp_max - hp)</code>, which is currently always 2, while maximal married HP mod bonus is <code>min(2, hp_max - hp_married)</code>, which can be 0, 1, or 2 (mostly 2):

The following table is generated with [[Template:Calc]] using [[:Category:Player ship modules]], it can also be generated using the following JS and <code>api_start2</code> response
<pre>
const ships = require("./api_start2.json").api_data.api_mst_ship
for (const ship of ships) {
  if (ship.api_taik) {
    const hp = ship.api_taik[0]
    const hp_max = ship.api_taik[1]
    const hp_married = Math.min(hp_max, hp + [4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9][Math.floor(hp / 10)])
    const hp_mod = Math.min(2, hp_max - hp)
    const hp_mod_married = Math.min(2, hp_max - hp_married)
    console.log(`${ship.api_id},${ship.api_name},${hp},${hp_max},${hp_married},${hp_mod},${hp + hp_mod},${hp_mod_married},${hp_married + hp_mod_married}`)
