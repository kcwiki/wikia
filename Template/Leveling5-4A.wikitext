Boasting one of the highest Base XP, the first node of 5-4 is still quite manageable. Out of 3 enemy compositions only 2 can not be tanked completely with an SS. This makes 5-4A one of the best spots to level up the expensive Yamato class. A few CA can be brought along for levels as well.

<u>Suggested Composition</u>: Yamato-class, 2 CA or CL, 2 CVL, 1 SS.

<u>Alternate Compositions</u>:
* 2 CV, BB, 2 CA/CL/CLT, SS

* 3 CV, 3SS
<u>Guide</u>:
* 2 CV/L are required for branching to easier A node. 72 Air Power will assure AS+, 36 assures AS.
* At least one BB should be taken in order to gain a second shelling phase turn, unless you are using the 3 CV, 3 SS composition.
* It is recommended to use 1-3 torpedo bombers on each CV/L to ensure the enemy fleet is wiped by the end of shelling phase. [[Ryuusei]] or slightly lower grade plane will suffice. [[Saiun]] and a radar or a secondary gun is recommended in remaining slots. If you feel confident in your fleet's ability to get S-Rank in day battle, defensive options such as boilers can also be used. [[Type 2 Recon Aircraft]] is also viable in combination with torpedo bombers.
* Utilize artillery spotting. Cut-in setup advised on supporting CA/BB to prevent them from stealing MVP.
* Use 3 sets of 2 CV/L and cycle ships to regenerate morale.
* Can also be done with various alternate compositions similar to 3-2A.
* Double Line increases accuracy, but Line Ahead can also be chosen for higher damage
Pros:
* High XP rate makes it efficient to level higher cost ships and multiple ships at the same time. For those looking to Kai their Maruyu for luck modernization, this is especially notable and allows one to get maximum advantage of her tanking potential while leveling her to Kai fast.
* Low repair cost such as in 3-2-A. While ships other than the SS can get heavily damaged, it is not very common.
* Able to level SLOW ships, such as the Yamato-class, Nagato-class or BBV. Allows for more freedom when choosing composition when compared to traditional 5-4 three nodes grinding.
Cons:
* High morale drain. Cycling ships to allow previously deployed ships to regenerate morale is advisable. This is more important here than at the 3-2-A variant, as there is a chance for your other ships to get damaged and due to most enemy ships being of flagship or elite variant, thus having higher survivability.
* Can get quite tedious.
* Slightly more difficult to control MVP when compared to 3-2-A when it comes to grinding CA(V).
