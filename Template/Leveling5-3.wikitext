Good place to level submarines, especially low level like Maruyu.

<u>Suggested Composition</u>: 1-6 SS

<u>Guide</u>:
* retreat after first battle.
* Slow fleet has 80% chance to go to submarine node
* As submarines cannot attack other subs, your subs won't be damaged, this will result in Rank D Defeat. D Rank gives''' 840 XP '''to flagship and 280 to other ships. Night battle between two submarine fleets finishes very quickly.
* If sent to node C, submarine will need to be repaired (low level submarines are very cheap and quick to repair)
<u>Pros</u>:
* Very fast leveling for submarines
<u>Cons</u>:
*  Very negative affects on Win/Loss ratio in sorties, which is a common requirement for participation in events (typically 75% win ratio is required).
