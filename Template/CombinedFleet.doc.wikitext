==Syntax==
*''Ship'' is the ship's name. For example, "Sendai".
*''Model'' is the ship's remodel. This may be "", "Kai", "Kai Ni", "A", "Carrier", "Carrier Kai", "Carrier Kai Ni", "zwei" or "drei".
*''Level'' is the ship's current level. Alternatively, if ''use_los'' is set, this will be the ship's base line of sight (LoS) value (without any equipment on).
*''Equipment'' is the ship's equipment. Slot order does matter as it is used to calculate the ship's fighter power. A full list may be found here: [[Sandbox/EquipmentListKai/TypeSorted]].

;Special Values
*''hq_level'' is the user's current HQ level.
*''route'' is the route taken on the map. This is used as-is, so you can write it how you like. For example, "A-B/C-D/E-F" and "A-B-D-F or A-C-E-F" are both valid entries.
*''map_name'' is the map's designated number or name. It is used as-is so "2-3", "Eastern Orel Bay" and "東部オリョール海" are all valid inputs.
*''notes'' are for any miscellaneous information the user wishes to add. This is used as-is.
*''use_los'' may be specified to have the ''Level'' field read as base LoS. As module data may be missing, this is a 100% sure way to get the correct ELoS calculated.
