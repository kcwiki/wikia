===About installations===
*Installation type bosses have numerous differences from ordinary ships that grant them unique defensive strengths and weaknesses against specific equipment.

*Installations '''CANNOT''' be targeted by any torpedo based attack which includes closing torpedo or night Torpedo Cut-ins.
|-
|
*CV(L/B) '''CANNOT''' target installations unless they have at least 1 {{DiveBomb icon}} Dive bomber equipped.
**If only {{TorpBomb icon}} Torpedo bombers are equipped (excluding {{Fighter}} and {{YellowPlane}}), the ship will always target non-installation enemies during shelling or stay idle if there are only installations left on the enemy side.
**{{TorpBomb icon}} can still target installations during opening airstrike.
|-
! rowspan ="4" |Weaknesses
|
*Installations with bombers equipped will not shell during day battle if they are [[File:Chuuha.png|40px]] moderately damaged or lower, or if they do not have any bomber left after opening airstrike.
|-
|
*Installations take extremely higher damage from ships equipped with {{GreenAmmo}}{{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Shell}}.
**The bonus is a 250% increase to the [[Damage_Calculation#Basic_Attack_Power|Basic Attack Power]] and it '''does not stack''', having more than one equipped will not increase the bonus.
**Only CA(V)s and (F)BB(V)s can equip {{GreenAmmo}}.
|-
|
*Installations take increased damage from ships equipped with {{WG42}}{{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfger√§t 42)}}, the bonus is a +75 boost to the [[Damage_Calculation#Basic_Attack_Power|Basic Attack Power]] for 1 equipped and +110 for 2.
**{{WG42}} can be an alternative for smaller ships such as DDs and CLs which can't equip {{GreenAmmo}} however it can only be obtained as stock equipment of {{ShipLink|U-511}} which only drops from the West Sea and Deep Sea areas.
**Moreover, the bonus is not comparable to the one given by {{GreenAmmo}} so smaller ships are recommended to equip {{Radar}} and {{Seaplane}} instead to help passing the LoS checks.
