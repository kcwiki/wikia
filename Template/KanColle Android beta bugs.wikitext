*A Text Error pertaining to the number of Development Materials used in LSC has been found in KC Android. 
**As shown in the comparison photo between the KC Web Browser LSC and KC Android LSC, the number of Development Materials players can choose to use in Web Browser is '''1/20/100''' but in Android it is '''10/20/100'''. 
**Please do not panic as this is just a '''''Text Error''''' made by the KC Devs! 
**It has been confirmed to only consume '''1 Development Material''' even though it showed 10 Development Materials in KC Android.  
*In some reports by other KC Android Beta Testers, the expedition text has been found to overlap, which shows the player 成功, 大成功 and 失敗 all at the same time.
*There is a Bug where if you switch between the Home Screen and Quest List in KC Android, the BGM from the Home Screen will play instead of the BGM from the Quest List.
*There is an issue concerning the size being rather large for both the KC Android Interface and KC Android Text in the Ship Girls List.
**This has cause some of the Ship Girls Name to be omitted from the List itself (E.g. Kitakami) and only the Ship Type can be seen.
**In LSC, players who have more than 1000 Development Materials can only see 3 digits as shown in the gallery.
