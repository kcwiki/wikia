== Usage ==
This template takes advantage of the new user mention [[Wikipedia:Notifications|notification]] to ping the user(s) you are replying to in a discussion <!--(so you don't have to use the {{tl|talkback}} template)-->. It works on any talk page or Wikipedia namespace page.

This template is particularly helpful in discussions that are not threaded, to indicate which user's comment is referenced. <!--If you feel that this template unnecessarily personalizes the discussion, you may still use the {{tl|talkback}} template on the user's talk page to indicate that you have replied to a comment.-->

''Note that it isn't necessary to use this template to ping (indicate) the user if you are already linking to their username from your post.''

=== Single recipient ===
To use it, just add something like the following to an existing discussion:
 <nowiki>{{reply to|User1}} Message text. ~~~~</nowiki>
For example, "<code><nowiki>:{{reply to|Jimbo Wales}} Message text.</nowiki></code>" displays as:
:{{reply to|Jimbo Wales}} Message text.

The comment must be signed and belong to a section in order for the notification to work.

=== Multiple recipients ===
You can reply to up to 5 people at once:
 <nowiki>{{reply to|User1|UserII|UserC}} Message text. ~~~~</nowiki>
