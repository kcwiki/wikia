<u>Overview</u>: <span style="float: right;">{{Edit|Template:Leveling5-2
}}</span>[[File:5-2_Map.jpg|right|World 5-2|400x400px]]A good place to level DD, CL, CV & CVL with higher base XP and possibly some rare drops ([[Taigei]], [[Mutsu]], [[Zuikaku]], [[Zuihou]]). This map is similar to 4-1 or 4-2, having 2 or more farmable nodes with medium-level ships (i.e. 30 or above, suggested post-remodel including maximum firepower and armor stats) if you survived the first node.

<u>Suggested Compositions:</u>
* (Flagship) Whatever ship you want to level with ASW capability + 2 CV + 1 CVL + 1~2 BB(V) + any other ships (ASW capability unnecessary for this) if you still have empty slot in your fleet.
* X are DD or CL, Y are all ships types except CV(L).
* Example: X/BB(V)/Y/CVL/CV/CV or X/BB(V)/CV/CV/CVL/Y
Note: The first node has at least a Ri flagship CA that can easily rekt your low-level ship in a shot, hence medium-level ships or above have better chance to survive. The 2<sup>nd</sup> node not always give you all-submarine enemy pattern, fighter planes still necessary to increase survivability.

<u>Guide:</u>
* You can end the sortie on 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> or boss node, depending on fleet composition.
* Fleet setup is similar to 4-1, be sure to bring ASW equipments to farm submarines in B or F node.
* If you intend to reach the boss after 2<sup>nd</sup> node, ensure better fighter planes equipped (i.e. Reppuu/Shiden Kai 2) to handle air superiority and better guns for shelling.

<u>Pros</u>:
* Easy for medium-level ships.
* Higher base XP.
* All submarine enemy fleet always ensures flagship MVP with sparkle.

<u>Cons</u>:
* 1~2 flagship CA on first node.
* 1 flagship CV/BB on third node.
* Not bucket friendly (for boss node run).
* Difficult to control MVP even in submarine nodes.

<u>Tips:</u>

Note: Keep in mind that 3<sup>rd</sup> node selection is random, hence you may encounter flagship CV or flagship BB there. Using anti-air cut-in setup will slightly reduce enemy CV chance to rekt your weak ships (DD/CL/CA(V)).
