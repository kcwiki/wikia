<u>Overview</u>:<span style="float: right;">{{Edit|Template:Leveling2-4A
}}</span> [[File:2-4 Map.jpg|thumb|400x400px]]
A map that's not too difficult for low level admirals who have the right vessels. This map is generally for leveling ships that are armor and firepower heavy. Eg CA(V), BB(V), CV(L). The node offers a decent amount of exp at the cost of morale so be aware of that. Not as effective as 3-2 so use it as a leveling spot with the goal of clearing 2-4 to advance to 3-2.

<u>Suggested Composition</u>: Place the ship you want to level as flagship (CV or BB recommended).  Try to include 1 BB to enter second shelling phase.  Include CV/L with bombers to reduce the enemy numbers and allow artillery spotting. Include a SS to absorb damage from enemy CL/DD if you have one (use them in rotation if you have more than one but don't forget to repair them or else sorting when they are taiha would sink them).

<u>Alternate Composition</u>: Use a BB or CV (blue planes) as flagship. Fill the rest of the slots with spare CA drops.  

<u>Pros</u>:
*Drop Shimakaze and Ooi.
*The map can be used early on.
<u>Cons</u>:
*Lower experience gain per sortie.
*Heavy Cruiser appear in enemy formation of 2-4-A mean submarines cannot completely absorb enemy damage here like in 3-2-A as Heavy Cruiser do not target sub. This mean it is more likely to damage player's non-submarime ships when submarine  is used and increasing the repair cost. Also Heavy Cruisers are harder to kill.

<u>Tips</u>:
* Try to utilize artillery spotting if possible.  (e.g. 1 seaplane + 2 main guns). Refer to [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Combat_Equipment_Setups Combat] guide for more details on equipment setups.
* When using carriers and battleships, don't bother sticking them into the repair docks until they hit minor damage to moderate damage. Since minor damage could easily result in a 1hr timer, just bucket them after some damage. Take note that light damage does not put a disadvantage on ships. Only moderate damage does.
* Enemy fleet does not have any air power, so there is no need for fighter (green) planes: Use torpedo (blue) and dive (red) bombers instead.
* Never go past the 2nd node. 3rd node will have enemy carriers and battleships and is unsuitable for farming.
<u>Notes</u>: The nodes after the first are progressively more difficult.  You can try them out to get a feeling for the difficulty.  Take your time to let your ships recover from fatigue.
