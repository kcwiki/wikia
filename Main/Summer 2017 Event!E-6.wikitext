==Map Guide==
*This is a combined fleet map.
*Node E, M and R are submarine nodes.
*'''Two [[Land Base Aerial Support|Land Base Aerial Supports]]''' are available for sortie.
===Transport Phase===
*The first part of the map is to reach the boss-node H and achieve at least an A rank in order to empty the TP bar.
**The boss node is an abyssal combined fleet featuring {{ShipLink|Harbour Summer Princess}}.
**To achieve A rank, it is required to sink 8 out of 12 ships on the enemy side.
*Because of the large amount of TP necessary in order to deplete the TP bar even on easy mode, it is highly recommended to use as many [[List of Landing Crafts by stats|Daihatsu Landing Crafts]] and {{EquipmentLink|Drum Canister (Transport Use)|text=Drum Canisters}} as you can on your ships.
*'''LBAS:'''A range of 3+ minimum is required to reach the boss node H.
**While the LBAS can be sent to the boss node H to help achieving A+ rank, it can also be sent to preboss nodes G or D to help your fleet surviving them. Preboss nodes G and D feature Battleships in line ahead/double line that can easily cause retreats especially when using a Transport Combined Fleet.
*Fully depleting the TP bar will unlock the second starting point and a new path to the second boss node S.
===Boss Kill Phase===
*The second part of the map is to reach the boss-node S and completely deplete the HP bar.
*Note that every surface node has heavy air power so it is highly recommended to have enough fighters to at least achieve AS at every node.
*Consider bringing 1-4 OASW-capable ships with ASW Equipment for node M.
*The boss node S is an Abyssal Combined Fleet featuring {{ShipLink|Aircraft Carrier Summer Princess}} as the flagship.
**During the last kill, {{ShipLink|Battleship Summer Princess}} will appear as an escort of the boss fleet on every difficulty.
*'''LBAS:'''For the second part of the map, [[Land Base Aerial Support]] doesn't have any range limitation in order to reach the boss node S allowing the player more freedom in the selection of aircrafts to use (even jets can reach the boss node).
*Once the Boss Debuff Mechanic is applied, the Boss fleet becomes extremely vulnerable and will be annihilated during Day Battle commonly.

===Boss Debuff===
====Trigger conditions====
*After clearing the transport gauge, reach the transport boss node H again and obtain an A or S rank victory.
**Previous victories from the transport phase do not count.
**It is only possible to reach node H again using a Transport Combined Fleet.
***'''Note:'''When at choice node A, DO NOT choose node C or else your fleet will route C-E-I-K and will not be able to reach node H.
*Obtain a S rank at node O.
*After triggering the debuff, the "Quest Completion Sound Effect" ({{Audio|file=Sound_se_30.ogg}}) will play when returning from sortie.

====Debuff Effects====
*All enemies at the boss node display lowered evasion and take increased damage.
