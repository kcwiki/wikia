* [[Taiyou]], [[Shinyou]], [[Gambier Bay]], and [[Zuihou|Zuihou Kai Ni B]] are considered escort carriers, they are execellent at ASW duties and can perform [[OASW]] at 65 ASW with an ASW 7+ plane. They are the only carriers that be placed in transport [[Combined Fleet]].
* All remodeled Light Carriers have 4 equipment slots, except [[Houshou]] and [[Gambier Bay]], who only have 3.
* Light Aircraft Carriers '''<u>can</u>''' attack submarines.
* [[Chitose]] and [[Chiyoda]] start as Seaplane tenders (AVs); in addition to only launching seaplanes, they gain two [[Type A Ko-hyoteki|Type A Ko-Hyoteki]] midget subs at their level 12 remodels for preemptive torpedo strikes. Their next remodel, at level 15, changes their class into light aircraft carriers. With this remodel, they will lose the ability to launch seaplanes and midget subs, and instead, be able to launch carrier planes like other CVs/CVLs. It's the player's choice on whether to continue as an AV or a CVL.
* [[Taigei|Ryuuhou]] starts as Submarine Tender (AS) named Taigei. There are three quests (A37, D13, D14) and an expedition (#39) that requires her as AS, so it is recommended to complete all three quests before remodeling her to a CVL.
* [[Houshou]], [[Ryuujou]], and the Shouhou-class are a good choice for expeditions that require a CVL (especially Expedition 15).
* [[Houshou]] is required for a monthly quest that converts a [[Type 0 Fighter Model 21]] to a [[Type 0 Fighter Model 21 (Skilled)]].
*As a reference, Unryuu-class standard carrier's fuel cost is 50 fuel and 55 ammo after Kai.
