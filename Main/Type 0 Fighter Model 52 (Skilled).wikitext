A fighter squadron flying Type 0 Fighter Model 52s composed of experienced aircrew. The final mass-produced model of the Zero Fighter, the "Model 52"'s successor's development was delayed, so it struggled as the main late model fighter force. The technical inferiority of this model of plane is made up with the clever piloting skills of the experienced aircrew.
