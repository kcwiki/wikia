==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* Kawakaze has blue eyes and very long red hair tied into low twintails with red hair ribbons, wears a white hairband, has very long payot, a long ahoge, and has asymmetrical bangs. Her clothing has a distinct black and white contrast with blue trimming, with a white-and-black collared sleeveless shirt half-opened to reveal her navel, blue neckerchief, black fingerless elbow gloves, a black pleated skirt held by a thick white belt, black thighhighs, and loafers. She shares many of these characteristics with her sister ship Umikaze.
* Her combat gear is unusually painted all black, with a hand-carried, twin-turret cannon in her left hand, a smokestack and antenna mast carried like a backpack, and twin torpedo turrets on machine arms from the smokestack.
* In her 2nd remodel, she now wears a more ornate version of her original uniform with red trimming, analogous to Yuudachi and Shigure's own remodeled uniform. Added to this is a tattered black and white scarf. She gains hair flaps, a gradient to her hair (it now fades to blue), twin braids in place of her twintails and her eyes change color to golden yellow.

=== Personality ===
* Kawakaze has a fiery "delinquent girl"/sukeban personality.

==Notes==
*[[Summer 2015 Event]] E-2 Clear Reward.
*Available at World 2-5 Boss S-Rank drop since April 22, 2016.
*Kawakaze's Kai Ni form allows her to equip [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft|(Toku)]] [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]] and [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft + 11th Tank Regiment]].

==Trivia==
*Her name means "river wind".
**It was first carried by the second and last ship of the Urakaze class Destroyers in 1915. The 1915 Kawakaze never served Japan, as she was sold before completion to Italy.
**Then, it was carried by the leader of the Kawakaze class destroyers in 1918. That class is sometimes referred to as the Tanikaze class as the latter was laid down before (even if she was launched and completed after).
**She was in 1939 the only Japanese destroyer whose name was carried by two other destroyers before her.
*She was sunk 7 August of 1943 by the [[wikipedia:USS Dunlap (DD-384)|USS ''Dunlap'' (DD-384)]], [[wikipedia:USS Craven (DD-382)|USS ''Craven'' (DD-382)]] and [[wikipedia:USS Maury (DD-401)|USS&nbsp;''Maury''&nbsp;(DD-401)]], between Kolombangara and [[wikipedia:Vella Lavella|Vella Lavella]], in the [[wikipedia:Battle of Vella Gulf|Battle of Vella Gulf]]; hence hers and Umikaze's 21:00 lines.
*Received her Kai Ni on April 22, 2016.
