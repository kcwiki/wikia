===Branching rules===
*This map is a [[Combined Fleet]] map

All fleets start at node B.
*Fast fleet with at least 5 DD will route B → D → E.
*Otherwise route B → A → C → E.
**E → F → I → G can be selected by the player.
**E → G can be selected by the player.
***If LoS check is failed, deadend offroute G → K. LoS requirement is unknown, but very low.
***Otherwise G → H → J.

===Recommended compositions===
*2 FBB + 2 CA + 2 CVL | CL + 5 DD will route B → D → E → G → H → J.
*4 CA + 2 CVL | CL + 5 DD will route B → D → E → G → H → J.
*Note that these require '''Fast''' CVLs like Shouhou, Zuihou, Chitose, Chiyoda and Ryuujou.

===Tips===
*'''One time Notice''': Check the [[Spring_2016_Event/Info#Maps|Map Ship-locking Info]] to see how the [[Events/Mechanics#Ship_Locking|Ship Locking]] mechanics are distributed in this event. Read and prepare your fleet accordingly to avoid "screwing" yourself over. Remember, no Ship-lock in Easy. 
*Nodes G and C have subs; node A, D and H have Ru-class battleships.
*On Hard difficulty, H has either a Battleship Princess and 2 Ru-class battleships (Flagship), or an Aircraft Carrier Princess and a Ru-class battleship (Flagship).
**Boss node has 2 PT Imp Packs, so Support Fleet or the Double Line-equivalent (Formation 2) may be desired to dispatch them. Additionally, using secondary gun can help.
**Hard may not be preferable for admirals low on resources and/or buckets, due to the nature of node H (preboss node).
***However, the Landing Force Daihatsu is only available on Hard. Admirals intending to challenge E-2 on Medium+ should take note of this.
*[[Fleet Command Facility]] is recommended to reduce the rate of retreats on Hard, especially when using a 1CL 5DD Escort Fleet.
