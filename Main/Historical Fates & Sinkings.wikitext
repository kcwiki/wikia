To complement the [[Historical Formations]] page, this page is dedicated to listing the fates of the historical versions of all the shipgirls in the fleet. Since their fates often influence the girls' statistics, personalities, appearances and quotes, this historical information may be of interest.<br />

The only shipgirl missing from this list is [[Maruyu]], because uniquely among the characters it is unclear which Type 3 Submergence Transport she is supposed to represent: there were 38, 33 of which survived the war, which may be why she increases the luck stats of others.

[[Commandant Teste]] and [[Shinshuu Maru]] are mentioned several times due to them being sunk and refloated at least once. [[Taigei]]/[[Ryuuhou]] is also mentioned twice, but due to notable name change.
