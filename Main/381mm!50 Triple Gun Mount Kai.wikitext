This is a triple gun, battleship main cannon from the land of pastas. With its 50 caliber, it is the strongest among its battleship peers. It's also known for its comparable range with that of the Yamato class's 46cm cannons. While it had problems with its accuracy and barrel life, the improved version resolved said problems.
