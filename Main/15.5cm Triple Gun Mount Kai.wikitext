The triple main gun mount developed to cover the absence of heavy cruisers, which were restricted under naval treaty, by deploying light cruisers with enhanced firepower. It is a masterpiece gun with anti-air capability that prioritizes a balance in firing range, firing rate and traverse speed. There was a version later used as the secondaries on the famous Yamato-class. This is the main gun improved from lessons learned in operation on large light cruisers and the like.
