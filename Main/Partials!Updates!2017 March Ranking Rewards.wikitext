|tweet1_en = Tomorrow the top rankers receive the "Type 1 Fighter 'Hayabusa Model II'" among other pieces of equipment. Together with its distribution we're also going to add an icon for "IJA Fighter Planes". The Type 1 Fighter planes will also be available in the Spring Event! Squadron #54 will be obtainable if you select at least Medium Mode, and on Hard Mode you'll also be able to obtain Squadron #64.

* New icon [[File:Interceptor Fighter Icon 2.png]] (陸 for 陸軍戦闘機, IJA Fighters) was added for all [[:Category:Interceptor Fighters|Interceptor Fighters]] except {{EquipmentLink|Raiden}} (that is, for 4 new planes and 3 existing Hiens, note that the new icon is just slightly different from [[File:Land-based Attack Aircraft Icon.png]] of Land-based Attack Aircrafts (陸 for 陸上攻撃機)), {{EquipmentLink|Raiden}} uses the old icon [[File:Interceptor_Fighter_Icon.png]] (局 for 局地戦闘機).
* Those planes will be available as rewards in the upcoming [[Spring 2017 Event]]:
