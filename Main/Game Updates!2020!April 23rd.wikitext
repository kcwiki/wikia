*To trigger this attack, the fleet must be in Line Ahead formation (single fleet) or Cruising Formation 4 (combined fleet).
*This attack may only be triggered once per sortie, and cannot be used if another special attack has already been triggered (example: if Nelson touch was triggered on a prior node, neither Nelson touch nor this special attack can be triggered for the duration of the sortie).
