==Character==

===Appearance===
*Mutsuki wears a uniform shared with the second member of the Mutsuki-class, [[Kisaragi]]. She wears a school uniform-esque garment that is half-opened to expose her navel, with a green skirt and brown pantyhose.
*On her second upgrade, she wears a black jacket with the characters "睦月改二" on the jacket's sleeves. She gains the Mutsuki-class' signature moon-shaped trinket on her jacket and on her red ribbon on her collar, and retains her pantyhose. She gains a few [[wikipedia:Camellia japonica|Japanese camellia flowers]] on her rigging.

==Appearances in derivative works==
[[File:Mutsuki-anime.png|thumb|right|100px]]
*Mutsuki appears in the anime adaptation of Kantai Collection. She shows [[Fubuki]] her new shared quarters like a tour guide after welcoming her to the 3rd Torpedo Squadron which also contains [[Yuudachi]] and the [[:Category:Sendai Class|Sendai sisters]].

==Notes==
*Mutsuki's Kai Ni form allows her to equip [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft|(Toku)]] [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]] and [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft + 11th Tank Regiment]].

==Trivia==
*Sunk in air attack August 25, 1942 northeast of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Isabel_island Santa Isabel Island], Solomon Islands ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Mutsuki&params=7_47_S_160_13_E_ 7°47′S 160°13′E]).
*Her name is an archaic word for January, specifically the first month of Japan's Lunar Calendar, which is no longer in use.
* Mutsuki was the name ship of her class, but since she was commissioned after [[Kisaragi]] (Mutsuki on March 25, 1926, Kisaragi on December 21, 1925), she is thought of as Kisaragi's younger sister. 
* Received her Kai Ni on April 23, 2015. 
* Some sources consider that the Mutsuki class and the previous Second Kamikaze class were only sub-classes of the Minekaze class due to a very similar design, kind of how the Ayanami class and Akatsuki class are considered sub-Fubuki classes. 

==Quests==
* Required by Quest A33, Quest A34, Quest B22 and Quest B24.
