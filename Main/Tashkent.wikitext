*Tashkent is currently the only destroyer to have four available equipment slots upon remodelling, she is also the only destroyer to have medium base range at any remodel.

==Trivia==
*Named after the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Tashkent (now the capital of present-day Uzbekistan).
*The construction of Tashkent was contracted by the Soviets to the Italian OTO shipyards, which built several ships for the Regia Marina including [[Pola]].
**She was to be a class of four, however Soviet shipyard practices made it too difficult to replicate Italian designs.
*''Tashkent'' would serve as a template for a planned class (Project 48) of ten destroyers. However due to the start of hostilities none of the other ships were completed, with only Kiev and ''Erevan ''surviving the war but ultimately being scrapped or used as a target postwar due to changing priorities in the navy.
*Unusually, Tashkent was painted a blue colour, thus she was nicknamed The Blue Cruiser.
*She was possibly painted sky-blue due to fact that she was named after a Turkic province (Tashkent - Stone city in Turkic) and sky-blue or Turquoise which is a long tradional Turkic color and also used in buildings in Tashkent itself.
*She took part in assisting Soviet Forces at the Siege of Sevastopol running numerous supply trips through the blockade. During one of her runs she was bombed by a German bomber and started taking water, she managed to reach port but sank on July 2 1942.
*With a top speed of 43.5 knots, Tashkent was one of the fastest destroyers of the war, beating out [[Shimakaze|Shimakaze's]] 40.9 knots, second only to the French Le Fantasque class' 45 knots.
