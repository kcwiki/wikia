==Character==
=== Appearance ===
*Unlike previous carriers portrayed as archers like [[Akagi]], or shikigami-using onmyouji like her sister ships [[Unryuu]] and [[Amagi]], Katsuragi uses a bow (specifically an ''azusayumi'', or Shinto ceremonial bow) combined with shikigami to launch her aircraft, making her a strange hybrid of aforementioned carrier styles. She uses a small gun-like device similar to [[Amagi]]'s in her original form but with an attached bow, and a longbow in her Kai form.
===Personality===
*Often likes to assert the fact that she's an aircraft carrier, stemming from wanting to serve in such a capacity due to being unable to do so during the war.
*Appears to be a fan of [[Zuikaku]]. A possible reason of this is the fact that when Katsuragi was completed in Kure at 15 October 1944, Zuikaku, the only carrier who participated Pearl Harbor still afloat at the time, was also in Kure, preparing for her next (and final) sortie. Ten days later, Zuikaku sank in the Battle of Cape Engano.

==History==
*Like her sister ship [[Amagi]], Katsuragi never received aircraft because her intended fighter complement - the 601st Naval Air Group - was engaged in support of combat operations on Iwo Jima (properly known as Iwatou, Iwo Jima being a mistranslation of the compund word 硫黄島 which using literal translation equates to Sulphur Island), and a severe lack of replacement aircraft and flight crews. She was instead shuffled between ports until reaching Kure, where she was moored and camouflaged to be used in an anti-aircraft role using her AAA batteries. Katsuragi was one of the ships attacked during an air raid by the US Navy Task Force 38 on July 24, 1945, the same attack which heavily damaged her sister ship [[Amagi]]. 
*Struck from the navy list on 15 November 1945 before being scrapped from 22 December 1946 to 30 November 1947, making her the only Unryuu-class ship to survive the war.
*Before being scrapped, she was assigned as a repatriation ship. After receiving minor modifications, she started her career as one of the largest ships in Japan's repatriation fleet in December 1945. She completed 8 trips in the following year, bringing nearly 50,000 Japanese citizens from South-East Asia back to Japan.

==Notes==
*[[Spring 2015 Event]] E-2 clear reward.
*[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Summer_2016_Event Summer 2016 Event] E-4 I node Drop.
*[[Fall 2017 Event]] E-1 L node Drop

==Trivia==
*Refers to the Admiral as ''"Anata"'' while the on screen text reads "''Teitoku''".
*Katsuragi's portrayal as having smaller breasts than her sister ships [[Unryuu]] and [[Amagi]] refers to the fact that Katsuragi was fitted with less powerful engines than her sister ships. While Unryuu and Amagi both used heavy cruiser engines identical to the ones used by the Heavy Cruiser [[Suzuya]], Katsuragi was only fitted with a less powerful destroyer engine, the same type used by the destroyer [[Kagerou]].

|JP02 = ○葛城<br />
カモフラージュを捨てて戦うシーンのイメージです。敵襲が無い時は普通に着物を着てます。<br />
いくつかの資料で最初の呉空襲の後に擬装されたと書かれていますが<br />
島に繋留されていなかった一度目の空襲時に既に擬装状態であったという手記もあるので、擬装状態でも動きのあるポーズにしました。
|EN02 = 
○ Katsuragi<br />
She gives an image of forsaking stealth while fighting. She would normally wear a kimono outside of battle.<br />
While several sources have noted that she first acquired camouflage after the first Bombing of Kure,<br />
a few claim that she would have already acquired it had she not been moored to the island before the attack, so she was made to pose dynamically while in camouflage.

胸は駆逐艦機関とシャープな艦容からあの大きさにしました。<br />
髪は葛城山に関係のある八咫烏に因んで烏の雰囲気を入れてます。
|EN03= She came in equipped with an azusayumi (Shinto ceremonial bow) and shrine banners. The sound of the bowstring controls the planes' movements; there are no papers involved.<br />
Her chest size is like that due to her destroyer-type engine and load capacity.<br />
Her crow-like hair is an homage to the legend of a Yatagarasu trapped in the mist of her namesake mountain.

天城は神楽鈴 、葛城は弓です。
|EN04 = Unryuu, Amagi and Katsuragi have thematic equipment in the form of shrine banners paired with a Shinto implement.<br />
Unryuu's flagpole has a sword on both ends. The "melee weapon" aspect is not to be emphasized, so a concealed weapon (the shikomikatana) is used.<br />
Amagi has a kagurasuzu (bells used in ceremonial dances), while Katsuragi has an azusayumi.

|EN05 = ○Katsuragi kai<br />
Just like her sisters, her clothes were opened in areas where ventilation is likely necessary.<br />
Just when the opportunity to improve the bow came, no ideas came on how to do so, so her aircraft were instead made to resemble the RATO (Rocket-Assisted Take Off). The tips of the planes (shikigami) were given prototype RATO, hence the look.

|EN06 = Her arm, which is covered by her flight deck's wooden deck pattern, is covered with cables which transmit energy.<br />
Her waist riggings are also structured to accomodate her bow. Her bridge-type gun was changed to a handgun-type.<br />
Underneath her shield, some Uchine (an arrow-like throwing weapon) can be found. They are somewhat visible once she sustains moderate damage.<br />
The Uchine will become planes when thrown by her hand with flight deck patterns.
