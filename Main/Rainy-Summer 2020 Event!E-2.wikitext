==Map Guide==
The map consists of 2 HP phases involving Combined Fleet.

===Phase 1: Supply Depot Princess===
The boss node M is an supply depot installation type boss. Anti-Installation equipment is recommended.

*Note: The following routes are not final and subject to change as more data is gathered!

====Routing====
Surface Task Force
*North:
** Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|J|red|M|red}}
***Ex. ''BB CVL 2CA AV DD + CL CA 0-1CLT 3-4DD''
**Lighter but cheaper fleet
*South:
**Fast Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|E|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|J|red|M|red}}
***Ex. ''2FBB 1CV 1AV 1CA(V) 1DD + CL 3DD CA CLT''
**Slow Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|E|red|F|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|J|red|M|red}}
***Ex. ''2BB 2CVL 1CA(V) 1DD + CL 3DD CA CLT''
***Adds an extra submarine-only battle (and thus small fuel evasion penalty)
***Better opening air strike potential, shelling damage, and chance for more morale gain (2 extra MVPs, plus 4 S ranks pre-boss starting at 49 morale translates into 53 morale entering boss)
**Offers potential for high enough air power to obtain AS at all nodes and high firepower at preboss and boss nodes
*Nodes F & C are submarine nodes
*Node E is an Air Raid node


Transport Combined Fleet
*Short Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|H|red|I|blue|M|red}}
**Ex. ''AV CVL 4DD + CL 2CA(V) 3DD''
**Only 2 battles pre-boss
**No (F)BB(V)s allowed and limited on CA(V)/CVL count (Very light fleet)
*Normal Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|J|red|M|red}}
**Ex. ''2BBV 4DD + CL CAV CA 3DD''
*Node C is a submarine node


Carrier Task Force
*Fast Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|E|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|J|red|M|red}}
**Ex. ''FBB 2CV 2CAV CA + CLT CL 4DD''
*Slow Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|E|red|F|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|J|red|M|red}}
**Ex. ''BB 3CV CVL CA + CA CLT CL 3DD''
*Node E is an Air Raid node
*Node F is a submarine node
*???


====Battling Supply Depot Princess====
*Historical ships using [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]], [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]], and a anti-installation rocket are capable of one-shotting the boss (2400 HP) in day with the right combination of equipment. However, this variation of Supply Depot Princess has moderately high evasion and combined fleets have low base accuracy, so it is recommended to sparkle ships equipped for anti-installation roles.
*Equipping dive bombers on carriers is recommended to prevent them from targeting the boss, and focus their attacks on eliminating escort ships to maximize boss targeting chance for anti-install dedicated ships.
*It is more effective for main fleet heavy cruisers to equip radar or extra main guns over Type 3 Shells, as scratch damage is more likely to deal more damage due to the high armor of the boss.
*Putting an anti-installation equipped ships in the 6th slot of the escort fleet is recommended to give the ideal shelling order in night battle.
*Putting an anti-installation equipped ships in the 6th slot of the main fleet gives her the best two chances to deal large damage to the boss in day and potentially avoid night battle

====Land Base Setup====
*For admirals in possession of sufficient anti-installation equipment, it may not be necessary to use land bases to target the boss node.
**If needed, 4 bombers or 1 scout + 3 bomber setup with 61 air power (68 last dance) for hard

*Targeting the preboss J node (if taken) can help increase pass rate at relatively low cost
**4 bombers or 1 land-based scout + 3 bombers

===E-2 Phase 1.5: Boss Node T Opening Phase===
Do the following in any order '''(Be advised some below may not be required for lower difficulties)'''<br />
'''Note:''' On Easy and below, the boss node unlocks automatically.

===E-2 Phase 2: Wo Class Kai===
Any Phase 1 comp that goes through K and meets the LoS check at R
All STF, CTF, or TCF (with BB) can eventually reach the boss
*Nodes E, G, L, and O are Air Raid nodes
*Nodes C, D, and F are submarine nodes

Examples:
*STF: ''BB CVL 2CA AV DD + CL CA 0-1CLT 3-4DD''
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|L|red|R|red|T|red}}
*STF: ''2FBB 1CV 1AV 1CA(V) 1DD + CL 3DD CA CLT''
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|E|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|L|red|R|red|T|red}}
*STF: ''2BB 2CVL 1CA(V) 1DD + CL 3DD CA CLT''
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|E|red|F|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|L|red|R|red|T|red}}
*CTF: ''FBB 2CV 2CAV CA + CLT CL 4DD''
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|E|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|L|red|R|red|T|red}}
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|B|blue|D|red|G|red|N|red|P|red|T|red}}
*TCF: ''2BBV 4DD + CAV CA CL 3DD''
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|H|red|I|blue|K|blue|L|red|R|red|T|red}}


*Defeating the boss flagship Standard Carrier Wo-Class Kai Flagship is not too difficult, but admirals wishing to obtain S ranks for rarer drop chances should prepare their fleets to sink the escorting [[Battleship Water Demon Kai]] (800 HP, up to 290 armor)
**3 TCI setups recommended, with two preempting Battle Water Demon in night battle, and a final at the 6th position
***Remaining 3 ships should carry double attack setups (for additional damage/chip) and night battle bonus equipment
**Historical TCI is recommended for greater chance of punching through high armor
***Hatsushimo Kai Ni, Asashimo Kai Ni, Ushio Kai Ni, Yukikaze Kai, Kasumi Kai Ni are potential options for historical TCI
****These ships may be useful in other maps, so plan accordingly



====Land Base Setup====
*The boss node requires high range to reach and has relatively high anti-air and air power, so land base support effectiveness is mediocre
*Targeting the preboss R node (if taken) can help increase pass rate at relatively low cost
**4 bombers or 1 land-based scout + 3 bombers
