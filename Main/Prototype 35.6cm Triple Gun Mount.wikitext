A newly developed prototype main battleship armament intended to be equipped on fast battleships. A 35.6cm cannon which was planned to be used on successors to the Kongou-class fast battleships, it was more compact and lighter than larger caliber main guns but of course firepower and accuracy were greatly improved from the older 35.6cm cannons. You should definitely try making use of these when upgrading your fast battleships!
