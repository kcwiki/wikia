==Strategy== <!-- Detailed events -->
Within the water, a recitation of the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Notes|Gosei]] is heard.
{{clear}}
As the setting is described, an [[Enemy_vessel|Abyssal fleet]], [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet Zero]], is shown. Along with a palette shift, a it morphs into [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet One]] & is then engaged by a naval base's [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Fourth Fleet]]. The naval base is in search of the Abyssal's base.
{{clear}}
A newly-assigned & now arrived [[Fubuki]] procedes inside the main building, is taken on a tour, one stop being a shared room & meeting the rest of the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Third Torpedo Squadron]].
{{clear}}
A fight scene interrupts, with the result being the base is located & the Fourth Fleet is ordered to return.
{{clear}}
Back at the base, [[Mutsuki]], [[Yuudachi]], & Fubuki share their combat experience, with Fubuki providing an odd answer. She's saved by a trip to the to the famous First Carrier Division. [[Akagi]]'s words strike a chord within Fubuki, especially the hope to be in the same fleet.
{{clear}}
The next stop is Cafe Mamiya, but before they get to fully enjoy, a siren activates, notifying them & others.
{{clear}}
At the port, the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Third Torpedo Squadron]], the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|First (Carrier) Task Force]], & the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Second Support Fleet]] are briefed as the Fourth Fleet rests in the docks.
{{clear}}
Troubles arise when it is revealed Fubuki has no experience, but with coaxing from the others, she pushes on. They encounter [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet Two]], with Second Support Fleet soon engaging as well.
{{clear}}
Suddenly, Fubuki is ambushed by a [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet Three]] [[Destroyer I-Class|Destroyer I-Class Elite Late Model]], but before it can damage her the Second Fleet's air wing strikes. With the Second Support Fleet's assistance, Akagi's third wave wraps it up.
{{clear}}
As the day comes to a close, Fubuki is left somber; however, the admiral takes time now to step in & reinvigorate Fubuki, sending her back to her fleet as they wind down from the day. Fubuki really idolizes Akagi & wants to be her escort.

==Notes==
The episode composition is an info-dump
* Possibly utilizes short scenes & one-liners to add as many kanmusu & animate as many game aspects as possible. 
* As of January 8th, 2015, there are 147 kanmusu.

[[Anime/Staff_%26_Cast#Cast|Certain seiyuu have multiple roles]]
* As can be observed in the credits

[[wikipedia:Gosei_(meditation)|Gosei]] is read by Mdm Sakakibara (?)
 These reflections were originally devised by Vice Admiral Hajime Matsushita,
 who was the Chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy.
 Every evening cadets are expected to meditate on these inter-related questions.
   1. Hast thou not gone against sincerity
   2. Hast thou not felt ashamed of thy words and deeds
   3. Hast thou not lacked vigor
   4. Hast thou exerted all possible efforts
   5. Hast thou not become slothful
<br>

Mutsuki implies that there are multiple bases
* According to English subtitles, anyways

Naka is advertising her first live
* It seems she is relatively new or has only recently set being an idol as a goal

Most duties are handled by the Secretary Ship

''Etch our victory into the sunrise!''
* Possibly a IJN motto?

''No arrogance!''
* It is a running theme in the second half, as well as a oft used line of Akagi's 
* A speculation, but perhaps a reference to a common belief regarding the IJN's loss of momentum in WWII

Only [[Kongou|Kongou is Kai Ni]].

Fighters have enough gun & cannon firepower to deflect destroyers
* Unlike the game, much less reality

|-
|Fanon elements cannot be too prominent in an anime broadcast due to prior art rules governing intellectual property of broadcast material. This is different from paper publications like the 4-koma where prior art rules largely concern visual depictions and not characterization. To summarize a complex situation, technically Kadokawa Anime can be sued by the first person to depict Nagato as a loli predator (provided such person can prove it) but Kadokawa Manga can't be sued for the same person for their 4-koma because they own Momoi Ryouta's work on kancolle. This is because loli predator Nagato is a derivative character but Momoi Ryouta's loli predator Nagato is MOMOI RYOUTA's derivative character. Of course, Kadokawa GAMES, who own original Nagato, can then sue the guy who created loli predator Nagato for making an unlicensed derivative character. Yeah, that sounds dumb as heck, but such is the nature of IP laws. 

Note that this specifically applies to Kadokawa's case as owner of both anime and game. If, say, Sunrise had licensed kancolle instead then they would likely have made the effort to depict characters differently, because then they'd have LICENSED derivative characters who can be further licensed for merchandising profit. They might even try to make original kanmusu for maximum gain.

It's just overall easier to avoid the headache by keeping the anime characters as close as possible to their game characters. It's also generally a good idea for the company to keep official depictions under control. One good example for why this is can be seen in the Marvel Spider-verse arc of Amazing Spiderman, where nearly all Spidey incarnations (and even Leopardon!) have made an appearance, except for about 8 derivatives which Marvel have lost rights to thanks to complex licensing. This kind of thing is also the reason Marvel has been trying to retcon the comic universe to match the movie universe to preserve a semblance of lore integrity, yet ignored the X families. This is because the mutants' movie selves are derivative characters belonging to the licensee. Kadokawa is similarly just trying to keep away from the headache of maintaining control over 180 plus kanmusu and their derivatives by maintaining multimedia character integrity from the start.

|-
|One problem about pandering to fanon is that different people have different opinions on the character of each kanmusu, and one man's meat is another's poison. Take Nagamon for example. Folks like to make fun of her but the people who really like her would be furious if the anime had decided to portray her as the buffoon that is so prevalent in fanon. Not to mention it looks stupid to have an idiot as a vice commander in a (for now) semi-serious series (though I admit that a Nagato that is a good soldier but still retains a feminine side appeals to me =3). 

The other problem is that trying to squeeze every attribute in fanon into a cour anime runs the risk of not focusing what really matters, in this case, Fubuki's development. Of course bits of fanon can still make their way into the anime but only if they don't derail the process. Akagi's appetite was included partly to show Fubuki that her idol is ultimately still just a (more or less) kanmusu like she is. The usual Akagi that we see in fanon is one that rivals Nagamon in silliness and messes up just as much. Hardly the image of some who's the Pride of the 1st CarDiv.

At the end of the day, it is up to Kadokawa to decide what they want in their game and anime. I rather have a story that at least knows what it wants and does what it should, than to have one that spirals out of control and ends up as a wreck just because folks tried too hard to please everyone and ended up pleasing none.
