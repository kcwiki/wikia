===Tips===
* The central routes (A-E-F-K or B-E-F-K) are not recommended as there is an enemy submarine on E node, which diverts attacks from DD & CL while stronger enemy ships deal heavy damage.
* Some recommended fleet compositions:
====North Route (A-C-F-K)====
*[https://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/nllP6mz.png 3 CV + 2 CLT + 1 SS] / [https://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://imgur.com/OdjEZDb.png 3 CLT + 3 CV]
**Opening torpedo and air attack can clear out the enemy easily, but it's not effective against {{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Hoppou}}.
**{{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Hoppou}} is always forced to attack submarines and her {{ASW}} is weak, but other light enemy ships are a threat to your submarine.
*3 CV(B) + 3 CA(V)
**CA(V) can bring {{GreenAmmo}}[[Type 3 Shell]] to disable/destroy {{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Hoppou}}. This is completely unnecessary if you wish to only reach the boss.
====South Route (B-G-K)====
*1 CL + 5 DD
**Guaranteed to reach the boss via B-G-K if you can pass the LOS check.
**Bring more surface RADAR if you cannot meet the LoS requirement with a seaplane only.
**You should bring your best DD, players without enough good DD should consider an alternative option.
==== South Route (B-G-K) with CAV ====
* [https://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://imgur.com/miMhomL.png 1 CAV + 1 CL + 4 DD]
**Good for Final Form and makes node G a lot easier as CAV can bring 2 [[Aircraft Proficiency|Rank-7]] Zuiuns to deny enemy's Air Supremacy there, force Air Parity on both sides => Neither side can perform Artillery Spotting.
**However, you have 2 chances of getting offrouted if you're using a CA(V) in your fleet, so this is generally not recommended.
**Moreover, this composition is now useless with the new routing since you'll pretty much be going though A-E-F(?)-... Needless to say, node E is a death sentence to your light ships (unless they're lucky enough to dodge shelling from two BBs and merciless Hoppou).

==== South Route (B-G-K) with AV ====
* 1 AV + 1 CL + 4 DD
**This setup utilizes an AV for opening attacks and also to establish your own air superiority. This effectively prevents your fleet from having to fight node G under Air Incapability, making this a more reliable choice. However, this comes with the risk of having a small chance to offroute to node A, in which you are recommended to just retreat. Unlike using a CA(V), routing from node B to G is always guaranteed.
==== South Route (B-G-K) OR (A-D-B-G-K) with 2 CL ====
*[http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/qyUiWiP.png 2 AV + 2 CL + 2 DD] / 4 AV + 2 CL
**This setup gives you 2 CL to utilize and 2 AV for opening attacks while also preventing Air Incapability. You are allowed to freely interchange DDs with AVs if you want, you can even go for 4 AV + 2 CL. The downside of this setup, is that the risk of offrouting to A at the beginning is much higher as well, compared to using only 1 AV + 1 CL + 4 DD. But in case you do offroute to node A at the beginning with this setup, you will have a higher chance to survive the A node compared to other fleets, allowing you to continue down the A-D-B-G-K route with no real penalty. Just like 1 AV + 1 CL + 4 DD, routing from B to G is always guaranteed.
==== South Route (A-D-B-G-K) with {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} and 2 AVs ====
* {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} + {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}} + 1 CLT + 1CL + 2 AV
** This setup takes the longer route but allows for stronger openings compared to the fleets presented above. A total of 3 opening torpedoes, 2 Torpedo Bombers and at least 2-3 Seaplane Bombers can be brought, making this fleet very useful for taking out a high number of ships before the shelling phase. The main issue of this fleet are the inflated costs if {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} gets damaged and the first battle at node A. Otherwise, it should not pose serious threats on nodes B and G for the reasons mentioned above. You are recommended to put {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} as flagship for her extreme frailty to reduce the chances of being targeted by any enemy ship. She is best used with 2 {{BluePlane}} and a {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Carrier-based Aircraft Maintenance Personnel|text=SCAMP}} to increase her shelling power significantly. Do note however, that her very small slots are subject to rank losses against the {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class}} at the Boss node.

*'''NOTE:''' Enemy patterns below with (Final) will always be encountered when the boss gauge is 1/4 or if you've already completed this map.<br />
** Although there is no visual difference, players at HQ 84 and below will face a weaker version of the {{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Northern Princess}} at node F.
