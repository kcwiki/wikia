Developed by Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal, the Keiun is the latest, state-of-the-art prototype high-altitude recon aircraft. This is its carrier-based version. The Keiun was a unique design loaded with all sorts of new technology, and was even planned to be converted into a jet attacker once the Ne-330 turbojet engine entered service. (This aircraft is only compatible with certain late-model standard carriers)
