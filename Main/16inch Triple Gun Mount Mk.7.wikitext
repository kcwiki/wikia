A new model triple-mounted main gun developed by the US as the main armament of the Iowa-class battleships. An improved version of the main guns mounted on its predecessor, the longer barrel length and other improvements increased its power. It's still in development, but radar-directed artillery is possible with the radar linked fire control system.
