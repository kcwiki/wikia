Although a low speed machine of an older generation with multiple non metallic wings, it boasts high reliability, operability and excellent mobility, serving as offensive aircraft of the country of tea with the name of "Swordfish". The Aircraft Carrier "Ark Royal" loaded with this aircraft against the Battleship "Bismarck" with the British Fleet struck a lethal blow, in an old-fashioned but brilliant fight result. This is that bi-plane, improved and crewed by elite pilots.

The Swordfish Mk.II was introduced in 1943 and came with a strengthened lower wing and rail for mounting rockets or a 1500lb sea mine. That same year, the [[Swordfish Mk.III (Skilled)|Mk.III]] was also put into service. The Swordfish Mk.IV was derived from the Mk.II but the only difference being an enclosed cockpit for Canadian training squadrons.
