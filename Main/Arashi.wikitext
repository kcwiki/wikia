<!--==Character==

===Appearance===

===Personality=== -->

== Character ==
===Appearance===
* She has yellow eyes and medium-length messy red hair with an ahoge.
* Arashi clothing similar to other Kagerou-class destroyers, including a white blouse with a black vest, and a red neckerchief. She also wears a black pleated skirt, white gloves, black thighhighs, and loafers.
* Her combat gear includes a twin-cannon turret held like a large pistol, with a backpack-like mount for a smokestack that carries swing-arms for more turrets. On her hip, she carries a pouch with depth charges, and tosses one in her official art. She also wears a belt that carries smaller anti-air guns and a searchlight as a belt buckle. (Due to similarity of design, the buckle can bring <em>Kamen Rider</em> references.)
=== Personality ===
* Arashi has a rough style of speech and an aggressive personality, although she appears to dread nighttime, having been sunk in a night battle.
==Trivia==
*''Arashi'' means 'storm' or 'tempest'.
*The real life Arashi is best known for her inadvertent role in the sinking of 1st Carrier Division aircraft carriers [[Akagi]] and [[Kaga]] in the Battle of Midway and thus changing the course of the war: the destroyer had been involved in chasing off the submarine USS Nautilus, and having separated from them, was steaming at full speed to rejoin the carrier fleet. Arashi's long wake due to her speed made her highly visible to US dive bomber squadrons from the USS Enterprise that had been searching for the IJN carrier force with no success. At the very limits of their range, and with squadron members suffering mechanical failures, the US planes used Arashi's wake to shadow the destroyer all the way back to the fleet. With Akagi and Kaga's fighters being involved in intercepting another torpedo bomber squadron elsewhere, the US aircraft were able to attack the carriers uncontested, resulting in the sinking of the 1st Carrier Division.
*In her hourly notifications Arashi makes references to night battle and [[Shigure]]. This is because Arashi apparently suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, specifically as result of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vella_Gulf the Battle of Vella Gulf]. In this battle: Arashi, [[Shigure]], [[Kawakaze]] and [[Hagikaze]] were ambushed by six enemy destroyers, of which 3 using their radars fired 36 torpedoes in 63 seconds, impacting all except [[Shigure]]. Then the other 3 enemy destroyers opened fire on them.
