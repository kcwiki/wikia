==Notes==
<!--* [[Fall 2015 Event]].-->
* All ship classes suffer a severe accuracy and firepower penalty against PT Imp Packs.
<!--** Before Nov20 JST evening, the original mechanism that provided Destroyers with the appropriate accuracy and firepower bonus against PT Imp Packs was not properly implemented. It has since been reported as fixed. However, some players have claimed a decreased opening air strike accuracy and decreased seaplane effectiveness against them after the fix.-->
* Starting from the [[Summer 2017 Event]], airstrike, aerial support, opening torpedo as well as previous anti-imp equipment are no longer effective. Instead, certain equipment combinations are now observed to have accuracy and firepower bonuses against PT Imp Packs.
*'''At least two different types of equipment must be combined to see significant boosts to accuracy.'''
**Skilled lookouts give very high boost to accuracy, and reaching very high accuracy is hard without them
**Stacking multiple of other types (without skilled lookouts) can give somewhat high accuracy. For instance, two secondary guns and one machine gun
*Applicable equipment types
**Skilled Lookouts [[File:Ssp c.png]]
**Small main guns [[File:RedGunLight.png]][[File:GreenGunDP.png]]
**Secondary guns [[File:YellowGun.png]][[File:GreenGunDP.png]]
**AA/machine guns [[File:GreenGunMG.png]]
**Seaplane scouts/bombers [[File:Seaplane.png]]
*Typically destroyers are used as anti-PT imp because they usually want to have small main guns equipped regardless, however CL, CLT, AV, CA(V), BB(V) are also sometimes used as well depending on the circumstances
*Equipping more different types of equipment will increase accuracy greatly, but some types (guns, machine guns) will increase accuracy further if two of the same type are equipped, albeit less than equipping an additional type instead.
*Some equipment types give extra firepower bonuses against PT Imp Packs, namely the main/secondary guns. For very high probability of sinking in one hit, at least one gun-type equipment effective against PT Imp Packs is usually needed.
*More equipment types, applicable ship types and/or synergy combos may have yet to be found/tested

* The PT Imp Packs are assumed to have extremely high evasion, so anything that improves the shipgirls' hit rate will be very beneficial such as--but not limited to: sparkling morale, fit guns, surface radars, high accuracy formations (''e.g.'' Double Line, Cruising Formation 4) and Akashi improved★ equipment.

*Support shelling and LBAS bombing appear to be fairly effective against PT Imps.

* They are most likely a reference to the [[:wikipedia:PT boat|Patrol Torpedo boats]] deployed by United States Navy during the World War II.
**Nicknamed "Devil Boats" by the Japanese.
