===Historical Fleet: European Ships===
All the ships used in historical routing are from European countries:
* CA(V): {{ShipLink|Pola}}, {{ShipLink|Prinz Eugen}}, {{ShipLink|Zara}}
* (F)BB(V): {{ShipLink|Bismarck|Bismarck drei|text=Bismarck}}, {{ShipLink|Richelieu}}, {{ShipLink|Roma}}, {{ShipLink|Littorio|text=Littorio/Italia}}, {{ShipLink|Warspite}}
* CV(L): {{ShipLink|Aquila}}, {{ShipLink|Ark Royal}}, {{ShipLink|Graf Zeppelin}}
* AV: {{ShipLink|Commandant Teste}}
* DD: {{ShipLink|Z1}}, {{ShipLink|Z3}}, {{ShipLink|Libeccio}}

==Map Guide==
*This is a single fleet map.
*Node A is a submarine node.
*One [[Land Base Aerial Support]] is available for sortie.
*A minimum range of '''8''' is required to reach the boss (M) node. (See Map Below)
**the Enemy Air Power and {{AA}} stat in the boss node are very weak (before Last dance, the enemy air power at the boss is 0 for all difficulties) so a possible strategy is to use 4 [[List of Land-based Attack Aircraft by stats|Land-based Attack Aircrafts]] on your Land-base, and send them all to the Boss node, as they almost all have 8+ range and don't require the use of {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Large Flying Boat}} or {{EquipmentLink|PBY-5A Catalina}} to reach the boss node.
**Sending 4 fighters or interceptors to node F (requires range '''4''' or greater) greatly lowers the chance of your ship being heavily damaged en route to the boss node, consider this for your pre-final run if you have difficulty reaching the boss.

===Tips===
====European Ship Special Routing====
* Using an European Ship allows you to skip having to fight against {{ShipLink|Harbour Summer Princess}}
** The historical requirement demands that you bring at least 1/2/3 European ships on Easy/Medium/Hard.

====Node A LBAS Aircraft Proficiency Training====
You may continuously go into node A back and forth while sending your LBAS there to train up your LBAS Aircrafts' [[Aircraft Proficiency]] at low cost (excluding the continuous cost of switching out your Aircrafts in and out of your LBAS). As it is a Submarine node, it is recommended to bring only submarines so that the enemy {{ShipLink|Submarine So-Class|Submarine So-Class/Elite|Submarine So-Class/Flagship|text=Submarine So-Class}} doesn't inflict any damage to your fleet.

===Boss Debuff===
*A Boss debuff exists for this map. The procedure is as followed:
**A-rank (S-rank on Hard) C and D node once.
**Node C contains {{ShipLink|Supply Depot Summer Princess}} and several {{ShipLink|PT Imp Pack}}.
***{{ShipLink|Supply Depot Summer Princess}} is weak against: {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Shell}}, {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)}}.
***It is recommended to bring some Destroyers/Light Cruisers at least to have an easier time to deal with the {{ShipLink|PT Imp Pack}}.
***For a better chance at getting rid of the entire enemy fleet, you may opt to use both [[Land Base Aerial Support|LBAS]] with 4 Bombers and [[Expedition/Support Expedition|Support Expedition]] if you are having trouble getting S-Rank in this node.
**Node D has several {{ShipLink|PT Imp Pack}}. It is recommended to bring more DD/CL with Small Caliber guns (Ex. [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount]]) and [[List of Secondary Guns by stats|Secondary Guns]] to have better accuracy against the PT Imps.
***It is recommended to still bring at least a Battleship for a 2nd shelling phase.
*After triggering the debuff, the "Quest Completion Sound Effect" ({{Audio|file=Sound_se_30.ogg}}) will play when returning from sortie.

===Possible Fleet Composition===
*{{Event/Route|A|red|B|blue|D|red|E|red|F|red|I|red|K|red|M|red}}:
**European Ship Composition
***2 FBB 2 DD 2 CV with European Ships (Easy (1) / Medium (2) / Hard (3))
****{{ShipLink|Italia}}, {{ShipLink|Roma}}, {{ShipLink|Graf Zeppelin}} + 1 CV 2 DD
***3 European Fast Battleships ({{ShipLink|Italia}}, {{ShipLink|Roma}}, {{ShipLink|Bismarck}}, or {{ShipLink|Richelieu}}) + 1 CV + 2 DD
**Non-European Ships Composition
***1 FBB 1CL 3 DD 1 CV(L)
