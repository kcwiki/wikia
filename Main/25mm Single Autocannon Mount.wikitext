A standard anti-air autocannon armament.<br/>An autocannon that was equipped on practically all of the later ships in the fleet. Assessments, such as: It can't hit..., It overheats immediately..., etc. existed, but it desperately protected friendly ships against the enemy aircraft that loomed like clouds. To prevent the overheating of the barrel, twin and triple mount types were also produced and deployed.
