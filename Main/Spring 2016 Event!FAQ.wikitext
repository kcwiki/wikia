===Is it possible to complete a map with TP gauge on easy for most of it and then revert back to hard for final kill?===

No, it works '''exactly''' the same way as the HP gauge. If you change the difficulty after damaging the TP gauge, the TP gauge '''will''' be reset to max and you will lose all progress on that map.

===Will I be able to get duplicates of [[Prinz Eugen]], [[Graf Zeppelin]], [[Akitsushima]], [[Akizuki]], etc?===

Yes, the only exceptions are [[Graf Zeppelin]] and [[Prinz Eugen]]. [[Graf Zeppelin]] has been confirmed by the developers themselves to be unobtainable if you already have one in possession <ref group=FAQ name=Graf />. According to reports, they still can drop if you get rid of the one you have in possession <ref group=FAQ name=Graf1 />, <ref group=FAQ name=Graf2 />.

===Why can't I sortie to E_? HELP!!!===

If you follow this simple 3 step pathway, you should be on your way to sortieing to E_
#'''Right Map'''
#*'''â€‹'''You'd be surprised
#'''Right Fleet'''
#*Single Fleet for Single Fleet maps
#*Combined Fleet for Combined Fleet maps
#*Transport Escort fleet for Transport Escort fleet maps etc.
#*Also, on '''Medium/Hard difficulty''', you mustn't have any ships that have been '''ship locked''' to a different tag colour. See [[Events/Mechanics#Ship_Locking|here]] for a hopefully foolproof explanation
#'''Right Requirements'''
#*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio
#*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships
#*Must have 20 free equipment slots

===What is/are the drop rates for XXXXX, YYYYY, ZZZZZ ship?===

Currently there are three sites with database on the drop rates. Information from those sites may not be neither complete nor accurate however they still form as part of the sources in terms of drops and drop verifications apart from information sourced internally from the wiki itself:
* http://db.kcwiki.moe/drop/map/341/3/J-SAB.html
* http://kancolle-db.net
* https://myfleet.moe/entire/sta/drop_stage
* <div style="color:#f00;">Coming soon</div> 
** http://kcvdb.jp/

More information on how to navigate around these sites are coming around soon, but for the meantime you can try using automated translation tools to get a gist on how the site is laid out.
