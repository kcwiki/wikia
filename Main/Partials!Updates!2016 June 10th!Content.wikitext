*Quest Page UI have been updated. Quests are now organized into categories: All, "Selected Quest", Daily, Weekly, Monthly, One-time and Others (presumably, event quests).
**Note: For "Selected Quest", after you complete the quest and received the reward the quest will disappear from the page even if there's a continuation of it (e.g. 10 Expedition Daily after that comes after the 3 Expedition one).
