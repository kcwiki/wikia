==Character==
* '''[[Glossary#List of Vessels by Japanese Voice Actresses|Seiyuu]]''': [http://myanimelist.net/people/10765/ Kayano Ai] (茅野愛衣)

==Trivia==
* Appears as the boss on the final maps of both the [[Winter 2015 Event]] and [[Spring 2015 Event]].
* Received a Kai version for the [[Winter 2018 Event]].
** This form is supposed to represent Iowa, as hinted by her equipment. Her fleet is supposed to represent William Halsey's Third Fleet.
** During [[Winter 2018 Event]] player is supposed to dispose of her using a Fast Surface Task Force. In real life such fleet would consist of Kongou-class fast battleships. 
*** Historically one of the reasons for designing Iowa-class was American inability to counter Kongou-class fast battleships, as no USN vessel could match them in speed and firepower at the same time. Think of it as master against his student kind of duel.
