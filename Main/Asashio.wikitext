== Character ==

=== Appearance ===

=== Personality ===
* Asashio is a dutiful girl who is serious about '''everything'''. She is so serious that she even gets mocked about it.
* According to Kantai Collection - Kankore - Shimakaze Tsumujikaze no Shoujo manga, she's  widely known as an honor student

== Notes ==
*  Asashio has a base Kai Ni form and an alternate Kai Ni D form, the latter turning her into a dedicated anti-submarine destroyer with better AA and ASW stats at the cost of weaker surface combat stats. This effectively allows her to perform opening anti-submarine attacks without the need to marry her. Asashio has the ability to freely switch between her two Kai Ni forms via remodelling, though her alternate form has to be unlocked by reaching the required remodel level, and she can only switch between Kai Ni and Kai Ni D.
* Asashio Kai Ni D is capable of equipping [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]] and [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]].

==Trivia==
*Her name means "morning tide".
**It was first carried by the second and last Torpedo Boat Destroyer of the Shirakumo class in 1902.
**After WW2 an Asashio class submarine JDS Asashio (SS-562) existed in the JMSDF.
**The name is now carried by the Harushio class submarine JS Asashio (SS-589), still active today.
*Sunk by air attack in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bismarck_Sea Battle of the Bismarck Sea], 3 March 1943.
*Prior to the Battle of the Bismark Sea, the commander of Des Div 8, Yasuo Sato exchanged a promise with the captain of fleet collier ''Nojima'', that should one of them be in a pinch, the other party will come to its aid. This was what led Sato to turn his flagship Asashio back to rescue survivors from the sinking Nojima after the battle, disobeying commander Masatomi Kimura's order to stop all rescuing efforts and retreat immediately. Sato telegraphed Kimura, explaining: "I have a promise with the captain of Nojima, we will rescue her survivors before retreating." After rescuing survivors from Noshima and nearby Arashio, Asashio headed north in an attempt to escape but was caught in a second raid from Allied aircraft and sank. The captain of Nojima survived and was picked up by Ro-101 three days later. Sato, on the other hand, chose to sink with Asashio saying "I'm tired. Just let me rest peacefully here. Go, you guys should hurry up and evacuate now." 
**This promise was referenced in the game by Asashio's 2016 Spring lines.
*Received her Kai Ni on June 30, 2016.

== Quests ==
* Required by quests [[Quests#A31|A31]] and [[Quests#B20|B20]].
