=== {{ShipLink|Nagato Kai Ni}} Special Attack Mechanic ===
*The special attack mechanic was renewed. Now, it also has synergy bonus with the {{EquipmentLink|Type 91 Armor Piercing Shell}} (Type 1 is still unknown) that are equipped by {{ShipLink|Nagato Kai Ni}} and the second battleship.
=== Stats improvements===
The following ships have their stat improved:
*{{ShipLink|Kaga Kai}}: +1{{Firepower}} +1{{luck}}'''max'''
*{{ShipLink|Akagi Kai}}: +1{{Firepower}} +1{{luck}}'''max'''
*{{ShipLink|Souryuu Kai Ni}}: +1{{Firepower}} +1{{luck}}'''max'''
*{{ShipLink|Hiryuu Kai Ni}}: +1{{Firepower}} +1{{Evasion}} +1{{luck}}'''max'''
*{{ShipLink|Tone Kai Ni}}: +1{{AA}} +1{{luck}}'''max'''
*{{ShipLink|Chikuma Kai Ni}}: +1{{AA}} +1{{luck}}'''max'''

=== UI Improvements ===
*'''Akashi's improvement page''': Equipment currently equipped on a ship will be displayed under Akashi's list when selecting equipment to improve which allows you to remove the equipment from the ship to be improved without having to remove it beforehand.
* '''Equipment List''': The equipment number in the header will become yellow/orange when the amount of equipment space left is less than 20. This is for the Event's equipment requirement (redundant for players who use extensions).
** A new category, 【全装備】 - "All Equipment" - was added for the equipment sorting in which all equipment will be shown including those that the chosen ship cannot equip.
*'''LBAS''': When choosing nodes to attack, the nodes that are in range - i.e., less than max range - will be blue, equal to max range will be yellow, and greater than max range will be red. 
**When equipping aircrafts into LBAS slot, for the 2nd selection onward, the tab will be opened to the page of your previously selected aircraft (always the first tab prior to this update). 
=== Christmas 2018 Seasonal ===
{{SeasonalGallery|slideshow=true|Kishinami/Christmas|Hamanami/Christmas|Matsuwa/Christmas|Gotland/Christmas|Zuikaku/Christmas|Akigumo/Christmas}}
