== Character ==

==='''Appearance '''===
* She has long, brown hairin twintails with two white hair ribbon accessories. At least in official art, at least one strand of hair comes down between her eyes.
* Before upgrade, she wears a single elbow glove on her left arm that has a seaplane runway on it, a long green jacket belted at the waist (with some ambiguity as to whether it's acting as a short dress, or she's just wearing no pants), and asymmetrical legwear in the form of a thigh-high sock on her left (runway) side.
* With battle kit on, all her turrets are on her right side.
* After upgrade, she has a much more visually distinct appearance, wearing a shorter green jacket, a long black skirt with such extreme side slits as to make it a pelvic curtain, and no visible underwear. The movie's concept art, however, displays her and Chikuma [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHlVSMLUMAE-nkh.jpg with actual underwear on].

=== Personality ===
* Tone is notable for her old-fashioned militaristic speech patterns and has an impulsive and brash personality. She's always relying on Chikuma, but also wants to establish herself as the big sister by acting tough. In most of her seasonal lines and 4-koma appearances she's always prone to make a fool of herself due to her impulsiveness.

==Trivia==
*Tone was sunk on 24 July 1945 by [[wikipedia:USN|USN]] aircraft from the light carrier ''USS Monrerey'' at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kure,_Hiroshima Kure, Hiroshima] ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Tone_%281937%29&params=34_14_N_132_30_E_ 34°14′N 132°30′E]). She was raised and scrapped over the course of 1947 and 1948.

*The reason why Tone only has turrets on her right side is because both Tone and [[Chikuma]] mounted all four turrets of their main battery forward of the main mast. The rear deck was equipped with a heavy AA battery and a complicated track and turntable system that allowed the quick launch of all 5 (compared to the 3 that all other cruisers carried) of her floatplane reconnaisance aircraft. This is depicted in her original form as a white pattern on her left sock, and on the skirt of her cheongsham in her Kai Ni form.
*Participated in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_raid_(1944)#Massacre Indian Ocean Raid in 1944] which culminated in a civilian massacre on her decks despite attempts at prevention by her captain.
**Despite this unfortunate incident, she, Inazuma and Ikazuchi are the only known IJN warships who have retrieved prisoners from sinking/sunken enemy ships. Turning them over safely however, is a prestige only belonging to Inazuma and Ikazuchi.
*Received her Kai Ni on 23/04/2014, together with Chikuma and [[Bismarck]].
*Her name was first carried by the protected cruiser Tone sole in her class, in 1907.
