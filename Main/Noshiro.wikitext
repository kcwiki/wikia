==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
*In comparison to the other Agano-class sisters, Noshiro has a much more serious personality. This can be explained historically as Noshiro acted as the flagship of the 2nd Torpedo Squadron after [[Jintsuu]]'s sinking, which withheld the IJN's elite at the time.
*She's not above having fun with other shipgirls, as displayed by some of her seasonal lines, notably Setsubun.
*Uses third person to refer to herself.
*While she can cook, she's only able to prepare curry. She mentions that fact in her 1 PM hourly.
*Frequently mentions [[Agano]] in her hourlies and appears as holding affection for her, even though she occasionally seems to get fed up with her ditzy, forgetful behavior. She also mentions in her Wedding line how she doesn't want to be seen as'' only'' caring for her, but for the Admiral as well.

==Trivia==
*Named after Yoneshiro 米代 River (also known as Noshiro 能代 River) in Akita Prefecture. Not to be confused with Noudai 能代 River in Niigata Prefecture.
*Sunk 26 October 1944
