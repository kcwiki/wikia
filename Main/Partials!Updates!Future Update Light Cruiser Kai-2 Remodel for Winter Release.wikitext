|JP01 = 現在「艦これ」運営鎮守府では、複数の新艦娘の実装準備を進めています。今秋には、「大和」と共に「矢矧」率いる最後の二水戦として出撃、満身創痍となりながらも奇跡の帰還を果たした、今も日本を護り続ける防空駆逐艦。そして、今冬には英国駆逐艦、さらに軽巡級の改二等も実装準備中です。
|EN01 = Currently KanColle Development Team is preparing for the release of multiple new Ship Girls. During this Fall, An Anti-Air Destroyer who had sortied together with Yamato and with the 2nd Torpedo Squadron led by Yahagi, even after becoming a total mess, was able to miraculously return and even today continues to protect Japan, and for this upcoming Winter, along with a Royal Navy Destroyer, a Light Cruiser's Kai Ni Remodel are all currently in preparation for release.
