|en = The cutting-edge carrier-based fighter Reppuu was developed as a successor to the famous Zero fighter. This craft, developed as a heavy interceptor with overwhelming firepower for use against heavy high-altitude bombers, and equipped with turbine turbochargers and a total of eight 30mm machine guns at various angles, is the Reppuu Kai. This hypothetical Reppuu Kai is a land-based interceptor which has been reequipped to operate from a carrier.
