==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
*Shimushu is cheerful and high-spirited. She, like some other ships, has a vocal tic; hers being "Ssu" (っす).

==Notes==
*As an Escort ship, Shimushu has a reduced ASW score requirement for performing Opening Anti-Submarine attacks, needing only at least '''60''' ASW instead of the normal 100.
*If used in [[modernization]], Shimushu will increase both a ship's ASW stat and Luck. If used in conjunction with a sister ship (i.e. [[Kunashiri]]), both will also provide an increase in a ship's HP. 

==Trivia==
* Named after the island of Shumshu (known in Japanese as Shimushu or Shumushu).
* Launched 13th Dec 1939 as the first of her class, commissioned in June.
* Although the Shimushu-class was designed as maritime patrol vessels according to the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Maru-3 plan), she spent the whole war fulfilling the role of a convoy escort, including the disastrous Hi-40 where six oil tankers were taken out by just two US subs. She also participated in the defense of Leyte. She survived being hit by a torpedo from USS Haddo (SS-255) in 25 November 1944, and was used postwar for repatriation before being handed over to the Soviet Union where she was used for a variety of purposes (including as an escort ship, a dispatch boat, and a repair ship) before scrapping in 1959.
