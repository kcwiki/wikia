===Seasonal Quotes===
{{ShipSeasonalQuotes}}

==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===

*Extremely fragile and with zero confidence.
*She appears to look up to her big sister [[Etorofu]], frequently mentioning her in her lines.
*Her Sanma line implies she has a stomach of iron: She accepted saury from [[Isokaze]], notoriously known for being a terrible cook, and found it delicious (albeit on the bitter side).

==Notes==
*As an Escort ship, Matsuwa has a reduced ASW score requirement for performing Opening Anti-Submarine attacks, needing only at least '''60''' ASW instead of the normal 100.
*If used in [[modernization]], Matsuwa will increase both a ship's ASW stat and Luck. If used in conjunction with a sister ship (i.e. [[Etorofu]]), both will also provide an increase in a ship's HP.

==Trivia==
* Named after the island of Matua (known in Japanese as Matsuwa).
* Led quite a lonely life escorting convoys, often on her own.
* Sunk by USS Harder on 22th Aug 1944 during a several day submarine assult, along with [[Sado]].
