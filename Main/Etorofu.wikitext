===Seasonal Quotes===
{{Ship/SeasonalQuotes}}

==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
*Etorofu has a forthright and enthusiastic personality, always willing to help anyone in need.
*She takes the role of a coastal defense ship seriously, and this determined nature tends to extend to other situations in the naval base, almost making her resemble a chipper version of [[Asashio]].
*Aside from her hardworking personality, she seems to lack other traits, essentially making her a pocket [[Fubuki]] in many aspects.

==Notes==
*As an Escort ship, Etorofu has a reduced ASW score requirement for performing Opening Anti-Submarine attacks, needing only at least '''60''' ASW instead of the normal 100.
*If used in [[modernization]], Etorofu will increase both a ship's ASW stat and Luck. If used in conjunction with a sister ship (i.e. [[Matsuwa]]), both will also provide an increase in a ship's HP.

==Trivia==
*Named after the island of Iturup (known in Japanese as Etorofu).
*Lead ship of her class. Launched Jan 1943 and completed in March.
*Etorofu-class, unlike their predecessor Shimushu-class, was designed and upgraded with convoy escort mission at mind from the beginning, although its design was still derived from Shimushu.
*Participated in the escort effort of Hi-82 convoy in 1944. The convoy suffered the loss of 3 tankers to US submarines.
*She survived the War and was used for repatriation until 1947 when she was handed to the US and scrapped.
