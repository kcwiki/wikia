|link03 = https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/830358371408580608
|JP03 = 【初めて期間限定海域に挑戦される提督方へ】 期間限定海域への作戦参加は艦隊戦力の充実と、艦娘だけでなく装備や資源、資材などの蓄積も重要です。まだ、戦備が不十分な場合は、すぐにイベント海域に突入せず、通常海域で艦隊戦力を充実させ、そして資源等の兵站を整えることも大切です。 #艦これ
|EN03 = [For those who are joining an event operation for the first time] Participating in an event operation will require fleet depth. Stocking resources, materials and equipment are also equally important. In case that you feel that your preparation lacking, it is critical that you do not jump headlong into the event, but instead try to reinforce those caveats on regular maps.

|EN05 = [For admirals who are planning to play Hard or Normal mode] For the “Extend Operation” of this event, having multiple of Carrier-based reconnaissance plane “Saiun” will be necessary. 
*You will not need them for “Initial Operation”
