===Branching rules===
* Carrier Task Force will start you at Point 1.
** 2BBV + 4CV and 1CL + 2DD + 2CA(V) + FBB
*** Seems to go a stable north route.
*** Pick node F as node D has a large amount of abyssals that hit very hard. You can still choose to go to node J if you are routed to I from node F anyway.
** 1BBV + 1BB + 3CV + 1CA and 1CL + 2DD + 1CLT + 2CAV seems to go J to M, or at least has a chance to follow this route, when it gets sent from F to I (replays [http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/imMjCTC.png here] and [http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/bhSbWc7.png here])
* Surface Task Force will start you at Point 2.
* Having Akitsushima (with any Flying Boat (Taitei or Catalina)) in your fleet goes J->M
** Otherwise, high chance of J->L

=== Optimal Land Base Aircraft Configurations ===
# AA Defense Squad and 2 Sortie Squads (All boss Targeted)
#* This setup will have an Air Defense squad with fighters and interceptors.
#* The first bombing squad contains 2-3 fighters and 1-2 bombers.
#* The second bombing squad contains 1 fighter and 3 bombers.
#* Pros: Allied bases (''i.e.'' planes and resources) take less damage.
#* Cons: Significantly less overall damage output
# All Sortie Squads (All boss Targeted)
#* This setup will have 2-3 fighters in your leading bombing squad. The number of fighters will depend on which difficulty you choose. Calculating AP/AS/AS+ requirements is recommended.
#* The second bombing squad will have 1 fighter and 3 bombers.
#* The last squad will have 1 fighter and 3 bombers
#* Pros: Heavy damage to the boss and supporting ships. Will often result in a kill on the boss before shelling phase occurs.
#* Cons: Enemy Raids have a greater chance to damage your groups. If you do not calculate your fighter requirements or the diamond formation occurs a significant amount of bombers will be killed.
#* Ideally used for last dance when AP/AS/AS+ is guaranteed.

===Tips===
* On this map land bomber and torpedo bomber strikes do Zuiun-nuke level damage to all enemies at the boss.
** Equipping torpedo bombers to elimate the surface opponents in any extra slots not taken by land-based bombers or fighters can work well.
*** As with most other air battle-related mechanics, results can vary wildly from run to run.
** Aerial Support Expeditions equipped with torpedo bombers and 1-4 fighters can output good damage at the boss.
* As with other installation-type opponents, the boss Central Princess is weak to [[Type 3 Shell|Type 3 Shells]].
* There are several reports ([http://i.imgur.com/J424HS5.png] [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiASgSNVAAAM3QA.jpg:large] [https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13221017_277760075894789_2477695726854535744_n.jpg?oh=45fc8da56d623d62e028f7e28792a3ad&oe=57A0146F]) of ship girls equipped with at least one [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]] doing higher-than-expected damage to Central Princess.
** The bonus seems to at least be comparable to the WG42 bonus on Supply Depot Princess.  ''Chuuha'' status cruisers can still output over 100 damage on the boss in one hit.
** It's currently unclear if equipping two WG42 increases the effect compared to one. However, if the bonus operates similar to the one for Supply Depot Princess, two WG42 will give a larger bonus than one.
** Equipping at least one WG42 to escort fleet double attack setup CL, CAV and non-AA cutin DD is advised.
*** Equipping two ''may'' be more favorable for destroying Central Princess, but does sacrifice other equipment setups such as artillery spotting.
* [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Landing Craft|Type 2 Tanks]] grant a damage boost (around *3,5 post-cap multiplier) against Central Hime Damaged Form. Using a Tank with night battle double attack setup is recommended. This setup hits more than any WG combinations on DDs. Ooshio is the best candidate for being the most powerful ship which can carry Tanks.

* '''STF with Akitsushima is strongly recommended over CTF''' on Normal and Hard mode. Routing to the boss is much less stressful and the heavy main fleet gets to go first, protecting the fragile escort fleet from most major damage sources.
* '''CTF with 4 CVs is strongly recommended''' for Easy mode, as node L contains only 2 fragile Wo-class (with no takoyaki), while the Destroyer Princess is easier to deal with than the flagship BRS on node M. Destroyer Princess has significantly lower firepower than BRS and is positioned on the 3th and 4th slot, giving your CVs a good chance to wipe her out on Opening Air Strike. BRS on node M, however, bears high firepower and in some cases, can nuke 1 of your CVs to taiha easily, and her flagship position makes her rarely become a target of your Opening Air Strike.
* Hayasui on Hard last dance helps greatly. There have been many reports ([https://twitter.com/BB_Y02_Musashi/status/732590311373832193] [https://twitter.com/Luimago_JGQD/status/732560007082835969] [https://twitter.com/aozaki_n/status/730747066863886337]) that 2x [[Underway Replenishment]] is vastly more effective than just one, visibly so.
* Some players recommend torpedo cut-in setups on high-luck DDs for last dance ([https://twitter.com/open_zoma/status/732202150613245953] ), as they get rid of the escort ships, allowing your CA(V)s/fBBs/4-slot CL to finish the job in case Central Princess survives into night battle.
* As LBAS is the one that does most of the job, some players reported CLTs being effective for chipping runs. Not recommended for last dance as it does require some luck ([https://twitter.com/S_HSMT/status/731445044385701888 though not completely impossible]).

===Notes===
* This map will be very Bauxite costly since nearly all nodes along the way you'll meet enemy carriers. (+1k bauxite) RIP fairies.
** This is true for the north CTF route.
** Especially if you meet AA variant at Boss.
** BEFORE you farm for Harukaze make sure your LBAS and carrier setups are optimal and loaded to the bone with fighters or you will run out of bauxite before you even see her.

* Going STF has a chance of your escort fleet being taiha'd by the troll sub nodes. The preboss node with Flagship CA can rekt your low armour girls.
* When using STF during Last Dance at Hard difficulty, you will always face the [[Battleship Princess]] composition at Node E
* Assuming that formation damage bonuses do not apply in night battle, twin WG42 has at least a [http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/wQbnJWd.png 1.63 postcap modifier] on [[Central Princess]]. (Twin Wurf+twin 5★ guns = (77 + 112 + 24) damage, which is 179 after accounting for 0.7 chuuha and 1.2 DA mod. Minimum armor roll on Central is 189. Damage dealt is 72, or 102 damage before 46/65 ammo mod. Minimum postcap bonus = (102 + 189) / 179 = 1.63.) Since the modifiers are 1.25 for single Wurf and 1.60-1.65 for twin Wurf on Supply Depot Princess, it is reasonable to assume Central Princess has the same WG42 postcap modifiers as Supply Depot Princess.
