[[File:Repair Team and-or Goddes on flagship.png|thumb|87x87px|You can select which Repair Team or Goddess to be consumed to advance.]]
* Event reward for clearing the following maps: [[May 2013 Event]] E-1, [[August 2013 Event]] E-2, [[Fall 2013 Event]] E-3, [[Spring 2014 Event]] E-4, [[Fall 2014 Event]] E-3 and [[Spring 2015 Event]] E-5.
* Can be equipped in [[Reinforcement Expansion]] slots.
* When a ship that is equipped with Repair Goddess is sunk, the ship will be brought back to life with '''full HP'''. Ammo/Fuel bars '''are replenished fully'''.
* The Repair Goddess will '''ONLY''' repair the ship it is equipped on. It will '''NOT''' repair other ships which do not have their own Repair Team/Goddess equipped, even if they are in the same fleet.
* You have to equip the item before using it, unlike other similar games or some derivative media depict.
* Also if this is equipped to a flagship, the player can use this before heading to another node, restoring the flagship back to full health as well as gaining the same benefits as said above.
* This item is consumed upon activation, and its effect lasts until the end of battle. If you further sortie and the ship encounters heavy damage again, you will still need to retreat if you do not want her to possibly sink, unless you have another Damage Control item equipped.
