{{SeasonalQuote|Kisaragi
|ja = そうね、今年の夏はきれいな海の島に行って、バカンスもいいわね。　ええ、だめ？睦月ちゃん、内地の避暑地がいいの？　そう？じゃ、そうしましょうか。
|en = Oh, I know, a vacation to the sea on a beautiful island would be lovely this summer. Eh, no? Mutsuki-chan, would you prefer a resort in Japan? Is that so? Well, let's do that then.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Yayoi
|ja = 暑くなって来た。卯月その格好はなに？　夏の装い？そうなんだ、ふーん。
|en = It's gotten hotter. [[Uzuki]], what's with that look... your summer dress? Is that so? *hum*
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Uzuki
|ja = 夏は夏らしい格好をするぴょん。ふーん、涼しくて快適ぴょん。ねえ、司令官？いひひっ
|en = Summer sure has gotten summerlike, pyon. Eh, it sure would be nice if it got cooler, pyon. Right, Commander? *giggle*
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Shigure
|ja = 長波、それ、いいお握りだね？うん、僕も食べたいな。え、そ、そうなんだ？そう、僕も料理やってみようかな。
|en = [[Naganami]], those look like nice onigiri, huh? Yup, I'd like to try some too. Eh, i-is that so? Yup, I'd like to try cooking too.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Michishio
|ja = ふん。おにぎりがどうしたって？皆新しい衣装や艤装で気が緩んでんじゃないの？そんなんじゃ夏を越えられないわよ！私？私は別に興味ないけど。
|en = Hmph. What's with those onigiri? Aren't you all being too soft with all those new costumes and equipment? You'll never get through summer like that! Me? I'm not interested at all.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Arare
|ja = このおにぎり、おおきくって、美味しい。お腹いっぱいになる。あ、霞姉さん、何を張り切ってるの？
|en = This onigiri is so big and delicious. I'm stuffed. Ah, what are you so fired up about, big sister [[Kasumi]]?
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Kasumi
|ja = はああ！？民生協力で店内放送？なんで私が？べ、別にやるわよ、貸しなさいマイク。こんなの簡単なんだから！えっと…はあ…霞よ、今…
|en = Huh?! In-store broadcasting with civilian cooperation? Why me? I don't really mind doing it, give me that mic. This is easy! Errr... *deep breath*... I'm Kasumi, now...
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Kuroshio
|ja = ああ、新しい水着買うたんや。たまたま、たまたまやで。
|en = Ah, I bought a new swimsuit. For no real reason, I just happen'd ta buy it.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Maikaze
|ja = もうすぐ夏ですねぇ提督。夏は、どんなステップで踊る？　ん～、どうしようか？　ねえ、提督？
|en = Summer is almost here, huh, Admiral? What dance steps should I use for summer? Hmm... what style do I use... Admiral, what do you think?
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Yuugumo
|ja = ふわあ〜少し長袖は暑くなって来たわね。え？夏季第四種軍装。そうね、そんな季節ね
|en = Uwaa~ It has become a bit hot in long sleeves, hasn't it? Eh? Change into Type 4 summer equipment? That's right, it's the season for that, isn't it?
|note=This is an in-joke. "Type 4" equipment is a reference to [[wikipedia:ja:軍服 (大日本帝国海軍)|the uniforms worn by the IJN]], in which there were only three types of them; there was never a Type 4 uniform in the IJN.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Makigumo
|ja = 夕雲姉さーん、夏季第四種って…それってもしかして水着じゃ…巻雲どうしよう？もう〜
|en = Big sis [[Yuugumo]], by "Type 4 Summer equipment"... do you mean swimsuits?... What should I do? Geez...
|note = Maybe it really is "swimsuit".
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Naganami
|ja = ふうぇえ。夕雲ねえ何水着とか用意しちゃってるの？へえ、やるね。あ、何高波？あたしはやんないよ。やんないからね！
|en = Wheew~ What are you wearing a swimsuit for, big sis Yuugumo? Hmm, not bad. Oh, what's that, [[Takanami]]? I don't need that. I really don't!
|note = Clearly Yuugumo wants to sound high-baller.
[[Category:Todo]]
<!--
|ja2 = いいね、そゆの好きさ、ふんふん～
|en2 = 
|note2 = New regular line?
|line2 = Docking Complete
-->
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Isokaze
|ja = 司令、なんだその目は？え、この夏は海に？海なら毎日出ているが…え？水着？なんだその兵装は？新型の電探が何かか？
|en = Commander, what's with that look? Eh, you want to go out to sea for the summer? We go to the sea everyday, though... eh? A swimsuit? What sort of equipment is that? Is it some sort of new radar or something?
|note = Clearly Isokaze is way too serious to remember this stuff.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Yamakaze
|ja = 水着？別にいいけど。着るだけなら。
|en = A swimsuit? I don't really mind though. I'll just wear one.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Kamikaze
|ja = ええ？今年の夏は水着でって…いやよ、いや！そんなのやるわけないじゃない！　私はいやよ！
|en = Eh? I should wear a swimsuit this summer... absolutely not! There's no way I can do that! I won't!
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Asakaze
|ja = あ〜、今年ももうすぐ夏ね？夏の終わりはあんまり好きじゃない。なんか、寂しいじゃない？
|en = Ah~ it's almost summer again this year, huh? I don't really like the end of summer. It somehow feels... a bit lonely?
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Harukaze
|ja = そうですね、大正の頃はそんなに肌を…いえ、そうではなくて、最近の水着はその、何と申しますか…破廉恥ではないかと。
|en = I see, during the Taishō period, showing that much skin would be... no, it wouldn't be like that. These swimsuits today are... how should I put it... they are a bit... indecent.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Matsukaze
|ja = よし、越えたな。　はあ、僕もちょっとナーバスになっていたようだ。よし、進めるぞ、行こう。
|en = Alright, it's here, huh. Ah, I was a bit nervous too. Alright, let's go, heading out!
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Minazuki
|ja = うん、そう。昔はね、この季節を水無月って言ったんだって。この名前、気にいってるんだ。えへへ…
|en = Yeah, that's right. Back then, this season used to be known as 'Minazuki'. Isn't this name interesting?
|note = If taken in the literal sense, what she says is true; "Minazuki" literally means "month without water", fitting the season of Summer.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Fujinami
|ja = お、夏祭りか？もち行きたい。浴衣、出そう、着よう。ん、よいしょ…ん…えっと…こんな感じで…あ、朝霜ち、き、着付け手伝ってよう！
|en = Oh, a summer festival? I'll definitely go. Gotta put on a yukata. Hmmm, let's see here... Hmmm... ummm... like this... [[Asashimo|A-Asashi]], I-I definitely need your help!
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Uranami
|ja = 今年も夏が来ますね？はあ。

{{SeasonalQuote|Yura
|ja = 提督さん、梅雨が終わると夏の気配、感じますね。ね？由良も水着…ん、もう少し後にしようかな？どうしよう？ん〜
|en = Admiral, it starts to feel like summer after the rainy season is over, right? Right? I guess I should... hmmm, wait to get a swimsuit, right? What should I do? Hmmm...
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Jintsuu
|ja = そうですね、この季節になると、あの戦いを思い出します。あの夜を…あ、いえ、ごめんなさい。
|en = That's right, when this season comes the memories of that battle return. That night... Ah, sorry it's nothing.
|note = Jintsuu is referring to the [[wikipedia:Battle of Kolombangara|Battle of Kolombangara]], her final battle.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Agano
|ja = 少しずつ暑くなってきたね〜。能代、どうする？この夏の最新鋭水着、買いに行っちゃう？…え、去年のでいいって？ぶうう〜
|en = It's getting a bit hotter, huh... What should we do, [[Noshiro]]? Shall we go and buy this summer's latest swimsuits? ...eh, last year's were fine? *blows a raspberry*
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Noshiro
|ja = え、阿賀野姉、新しい水着買いに行くの？去年ので良くない？贅沢はだめです！そもそも、私達は提督のために…
|en = Eh, you're going to buy a new swimsuit, Agano? Isn't last year's fine? Luxury is prohibited! In the first place, we're here for the sake of the Admiral...*nagging fades out*
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Yahagi
|ja = 磯風、何を練習しているの？うん、うん、秋に備えて夏から練習を…大変ね？
|en = What practicing, [[Isokaze]]? I see, practice from summer to prepare for fall... must be hard, huh?
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Sakawa
|ja = ふう〜なんかこの季節、酒匂あんまり好きじゃない！っていうか、嫌い、嫌い！
|en = Whew~ Somehow I really don't like this season! I mean, I really hate it!
|note = Sakawa was sunk on 2 July 1946 at a nuclear bomb test at Bikini Atoll; this is around the season of summer, which is fitting why she doesn't like it.
}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Ooyodo
|ja = 明石、何？水着？いえ、私は鎮守府での任務がありますから…え、明石もそれはあるって？関係ないって？あの、いや、だからね。
|en = [[Akashi]], what is it? A swimsuit? Uh, I have duties to do around the Naval Base, so... Eh, you have them too? They don't matter? Ummm, that isn't right...

}}
{{SeasonalQuote|Yamashiro
|ja = 扶桑姉さま、確かに、少し暑いですね。私、氷小豆もらってきます。間宮さんから。
