'''Notes'''
* [[Glossary#Class classification|'*' Abbreviations are derived rather than official]]

* Battleships & Fast Battleships share the hull classification, BB.

* Light Aircraft Carriers & Standard Aircraft Carriers are termed 正規空母, or Fleet Carriers, to distinguish them from Escort Carriers or other carrier types. This term sometimes refers only to Standard Aircraft Carriers.

* There are 253 kanmusu (sans remodels & class changes) as of the November 27, 2020 Update.

'''Exceptions'''
* [[:Category:Katori Class|Training Cruisers]] & [[:Category:Torpedo Cruisers|Torpedo Cruisers]] do not count as a [[List of light cruisers by upgraded maximum stats|Light Cruiser]] for [[Expedition|expeditions]] or [[Tutorial: FAQ#Why do I keep getting sent to the wrong place?|branching rules]] requirements.
* Similarly, [[EliteCAV|Aviation Cruisers]] & [[EliteBBV|Aviation Battleships]] do not count as a [[List of heavy cruisers by upgraded maximum stats|Heavy Cruiser]] & [[List of battleships by upgraded maximum stats|Battleship]], respectively<sup>[[Tutorial: FAQ#Are Kitakami and Ooi first and second remodels considered as CLs for expedition and map requirement purposes?|[0]]]</sup>.
* The [[:Category:Chitose Class|Chitose-class]]' carrier remodels shift them from [[List of seaplane tenders by upgraded maximum stats|Seaplane Tenders]] to [[EliteCVL|Light Aircraft Carriers]].
* {{ShipLink|Taigei}}'s remodel shifts her from a [[Auxiliary Ships|Submarine Tender]] to a [[EliteCVL|Light Aircraft Carrier]].
