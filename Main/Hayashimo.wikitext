== Character ==
===Appearance===
* Hayashimo wears the standard Yuugumo-class school uniform which consists of a purple sleeveless dress over a white shirt, a teal-blue bowtie andgrey opaque pantyhose with lace-up boots. She wears her rigging on her back as a backpack with a single oblique yellow strap. Quadruple torpedo launchers are strapped to her thighs, and she wields a twin-cannon 12.7cm turret with both hands.
* Hayshimo has very long black hair in a modified hime cut with her bangs covering her right eye, hair ribbons somewhat like Hiyou's, but wider and not tied into bows, and a generally flared but clean-cut appearance. She also has red eyes.
=== Personality ===
* Hayashimo speaks in-game like a stereotypical Japanese regretful or vengeful ghost, (particularly Sadako from Ringu, whom she also physically resembles) including lines that make her sound obsessive and creepy. Her in-game lines portray her as perpetually mournful of her real ship's fate, and her inability to change that fate. Unusually for a destroyer, she also pushes alcohol on the admiral, and was the first destroyer to serve alcohol (Nachi's whiskey) with the Anchorage Counter Bar all night long. Because of her lines, particularity her idle line, she has gained a fanwork stereotype as an obsessive stalker.

==Trivia==
*Heavily damaged and deliberately grounded during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after multiple rescue attempts, including [[Shiranui]]'s sinking while attempting rescue. Deemed out of action and abandoned 28 October 1944 (found at coordinates 12.1702393, 121.3550663).
* Wreck rumored to have settled deeper at a cove near Semirara, eluding divers.
