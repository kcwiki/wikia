* [[LoS]] requirement is 28 in [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=4)]] for G->K.
** C<sub>n</sub>=4 indicates that the LoS you receive from equipment weights 4x more than usual.

===Tips===
* The central routes (B-E-H-K or F-E-H-K) are not recommended as there is an enemy submarine on E node, which diverts attacks from DD & CL while stronger enemy ships deal heavy damage.
* Some recommended fleet compositions:
====North Route (B-D-H-K)====
*[https://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/nllP6mz.png 3 CV + 2 CLT + 1 SS] / [https://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://imgur.com/OdjEZDb.png 3 CLT + 3 CV] / [https://i.imgur.com/lkvKsTS.jpg 3CV + 3SS]
**Opening torpedo and air attack can clear out the enemy easily, but it's not effective against {{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Hoppou}}.
**{{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Hoppou}} is always forced to attack submarines and her {{ASW}} is weak, but other light enemy ships are a threat to your submarine.
**With {{EquipmentLink|12cm 30-tube Rocket Launcher Kai Ni}}, all CV and CAV that have this equipped will have a chance of taking no damage during airstrike.
*3 CV(B) + 3 CA(V)
**CA(V) can bring {{GreenAmmo}}[[Type 3 Shell]] to disable/destroy {{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Hoppou}}. This is completely unnecessary if you wish to only reach the boss.

====South Route (F-G-K)====
*1 CL + 5 DD / 1 AV + 5 DD
**Guaranteed to reach the boss via F-G-K if you can pass the LOS check.
**Bring more surface RADAR if you cannot meet the LoS requirement with a seaplane only.
**You should bring your best DD, players without enough good DD should consider an alternative option.

==== South Route (F-G-K) OR (B-C-F-G-K) with CL and AV====
*[http://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/qyUiWiP.png 2 AV + 2 CL + 2 DD] / 4 AV + 2 CL
**Allowing more CL to utilize and AV for opening attacks while preventing Air Incapability
**You are allowed to freely interchange DDs with AVs if you want, you can even go for 4 AV + 2 CL.
**However, the downside of this setup is that the risk of off-routing to B at the beginning. But in case you survived the B node, you can still continue down the B-C-F-G-K route as routing from F to G is always guaranteed.

==== South Route (B-C-F-G-K) with {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} and 2 AVs ====
* {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} + {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}} + 1 CLT + 1CL + 2 AV
** This setup takes the longer route but allows for stronger openings compared to the fleets presented above. A total of 3 opening torpedoes, 2 Torpedo Bombers and at least 2-3 Seaplane Bombers can be brought, making this fleet very useful for taking out a high number of ships before the shelling phase. The main issue of this fleet are the inflated costs if {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} gets damaged and the first battle at node B. Otherwise, it should not pose serious threats on nodes F and G for the reasons mentioned above. You are recommended to put {{ShipLink|Hayasui Kai}} as flagship for her extreme frailty to reduce the chances of being targeted by any enemy ship. She is best used with 2 {{BluePlane}} and a {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Carrier-based Aircraft Maintenance Personnel|text=SCAMP}} to increase her shelling power significantly. Do note however, that her very small slots are subject to rank losses against the {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class}} at the Boss node.

*'''NOTE:''' Enemy patterns below with (Final) will always be encountered when the boss gauge is 1/4 or if you've already completed this map.<br /> 
** Although there is no visual difference, players at HQ 84 and below will face a weaker version of the {{ShipLink|Northern Princess III|text=Northern Princess}} at node H.
