==Character==

[[File:Anime hibiki.png|thumb|250px]]

===Appearance===
*Wears a similar serafuku to the rest of her class with an anchor emblem on the chest.
*She and [[Akatsuki]] wear navy hats that also bear an anchor emblem.
*She has bleached hair that is slightly disheveled, in a similar manner to her sisters.
**Another trait shared with her sisters is the matching colour of her eyes and hair.
====''Second Remodel''====
*Interestingly, her attire and armaments don't change significantly between her first and second remodels, despite historical stripping and rearmament of the latter with Soviet-made weapons.
*The most distinctive change in her second remodel is her change of hat; the red-coloured star and hammer-and-sickle (hard to discern) are direct references to the [[wikipedia:List_of_USSR_navy_flags#Ensign_and_Flag|Naval Flag of the Soviet Union]].
*A pair of Soviet 533mm quadruple torpedo tubes replaces her two Japanese 61cm triple torpedo mounts.
===Personality===
*Characterized in the anime by her vacant attitude and expression.
*A calm and stoic Russophile who tends to include Russian words in her speech. As Верный, she speaks more Russian.
**However, as revealed in the 4-koma, her vocabulary in Russian is noted to be rather limited, as [[Fubuki]] tries to hold a conversation with her in Russian, only for Verniy to panic and say that it would be better for them to converse in Japanese instead.

==Notes==
*Verniy is capable of equipping [[Anti-torpedo Bulge (Medium)]].
*Verniy is one of the few destroyers able to equip the [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]], alongside [[Kasumi Kai Ni B|Kasumi Kai Ni (B)]], [[Asashio Kai Ni D|Asashio Kai Ni (D)]], [[Ooshio Kai Ni]], [[Arashio Kai Ni]], [[Mutsuki Kai Ni]], [[Kisaragi Kai Ni]], [[Satsuki Kai Ni]], [[Fumizuki Kai Ni]] and [[Kawakaze Kai Ni]].
*Verniy is also one of the currently only seven destroyers able to equip the [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Landing Craft]], alongside [[Kasumi Kai Ni B|Kasumi Kai Ni (B)]], [[Asashio Kai Ni D|Asashio Kai Ni (D)]], [[Ooshio Kai Ni]], [[Arashio Kai Ni]], [[Satsuki Kai Ni]] and [[Fumizuki Kai Ni]].

==Trivia==
*Hibiki means "echo", Верный (''Verniy'') means "loyal" and her final name, Декабрист (''Dekabrist'') is a tribute to the Decembrist revolt.
**Hibiki was first carried by the twenty-first ship of the first Kamikaze class in 1906.
**Верный was first carried by a submarine class in the old USSR.
**Hibiki's present incarnation exists as the lead ship of Hibiki-class Ocean Surveillance Ship, AOS-5201 JDS Hibiki of Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.
* Received her Kai Ni (Верный) on 11/09/2013.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunsaku_Kud%C5%8D Shunsaku Kudō] was transferred to Hibiki after his humanitarian rescue of enemy personnel while captain of [[Ikazuchi]].
*She was retired from service on February 20 1953 and sunk as a target by the Soviet Naval Aviation team sometime in the 1970's at Karamzina Island near Vladivostok.
**After being discovered in 2012, her wreckage is now a popular diving site. Seasonal diving tours to her wreckage are available.

==Quests==
*Composition: [[Quests#A10|A10]].
*Sortie (Any): [[Quests#B12|B12]].
*Sortie (Clearance): [[Quests#B42|B42]].
