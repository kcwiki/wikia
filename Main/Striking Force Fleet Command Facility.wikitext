*Works similarly to [[Fleet Command Facility]] (FCF) in a Striking Force (7-ship fleet). When equipped on the flagship, it allows you to retreat heavily damaged non-flagship ships. However, unlike [[Fleet Command Facility]], you DO NOT need to retreat 2 ships, just the heavily damaged one.
*Currently only usable with Striking Force and thus event-only.
*It is not interchangeable with FCF; using this for [[Combined Fleet]] or vice versa will result in nothing.
*1 ship per battle can retreat until there is only 1 ship left.
