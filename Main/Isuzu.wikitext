==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
*Isuzu is hardworking and diligent, but is also a little bit haughty and proud. Despite her not being above calling her Admiral an idiot, she is aware that she has to work hard to become stronger.

==Notes==
*Isuzu's second remodel was given the ability to initiate [[Combat#Anti-Air Cut-in|Anti-Air Cut-Ins]] without Anti-Air Fire Directors on 31/07/2015.
**The setup required is: <u>High-Angle mount</u> (any) {{GreenGunDP}}, plus <u>AA Gun</u> (any) {{GreenGunMG}}, plus <u>AA RADAR</u>{{Radar}}
**This is assigned the API value of 14.
*The abovementioned setup was buffed on 19/01/2016, and a second setup with a weaker AACI was added on the same date. Isuzu shares the same AACI setup as [[Kasumi|Kasumi Kai Ni B]].<ref>https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/689356907786674177</ref>
**The second setup is: <u>High-Angle mount</u> (any) {{GreenGunDP}}, plus <u>AA Gun</u> (any) {{GreenGunMG}}. This allows her to perform double attacks at night in addition to AACI in the day if another gun is used at the cost of lower AACI power.
**This is assigned the API value of 15.
*Both AACIs has a higher check priority than an AACIs with a value lower than 14, including the stronger Akizuki and Maya AACIs.
*Isuzu Kai Ni is capable of performing a preemptive [[Combat/Main#Opening_Anti-submarine_Attack|opening attack against submarines]], regardless of her ASW stat.

==Trivia==
*Sunk 7 April 1945 by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy United States Navy] off [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumbawa Sumbawa], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Sea Java Sea] [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Isuzu&params=07_38_S_118_09_E_ 07°38′S118°09′E].
* The only light cruiser which underwent conversion into a dedicated anti-aircraft/anti-submarine cruiser.
* Isuzu class destroyer escort JDS Isuzu had been commissioned to Maritime Self Defense Force (1961-1992).
* Received her Kai Ni on 25/09/2013.
* There are players that farm her as she gives useful starter equipment ([[Type 21 Air Radar]]) and can be used as modernization fodder to give a 5 points boost to anti-air stat. This is further encouraged by her high drop rate and low remodel level at level 12.

== [[Quests]] ==
*Required by Quests [[Quests#A63|A63]], [[Quests#B55|B55]], [[Quests#A66|A66]], [[Quests#B60|B60]], [[Quests#B72|B72]].
