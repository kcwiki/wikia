==Information Update==
According to information [http://kancolle.doorblog.jp/archives/50615424.html extracted by Japanese bloggers from interview on Tanaka as printed on the latest Comptiq magazine]:
* The winter event will have 3 maps.
* Winter event is based on Operation Hikari which is a transportation operation done by I-class subs to Truk Islands.
* It will also have reconnaissance mission before launching an attack on the enemy's Ulithi Atoll Base.
* The follow-up in history is the Operation Arashi, but it will be unfolded differently in Kancolle.
* The Operation preparation near Nanao-kita Bay, strengthening your defense and patrol near Chichijima, Ogasawara Island will be the motif before the Main Operation. (Related to Matsukaze?)
* Both new submarine equipment and the I-class submarine which have successfully completed Operation Hikari will be implemented in the final map.
* And there will have certain type of twins that's involved in the Operation Hikari (I-13?)
