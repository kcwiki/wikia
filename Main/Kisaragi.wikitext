==Character==

===Appearance===
*Kisaragi wears a school uniform-esque garment that is shared with the first two members of the Mutsuki-class, [[Mutsuki]] and herself. Unlike Mutsuki, however, her uniform is not half-opened to expose her navel, as shown in ''[[Merchandise/KanColle Arcade|KanColle Arcade]]'' (though it is half-opened in the anime), and wears knee-high stockings that are of the same design as Mutsuki's as opposed to full-length pantyhose. She has a distinct flower-shaped hair piece.
*On her second upgrade, she wears a jacket similar to Mutsuki's, with the characters "如月改二" on the jacket's sleeves. She gains the Mutsuki-class' signature moon-shaped trinket on her jacket and on the side of her uniform, and retains her knee-high stockings and hair piece.

==Notes==
*Kisaragi's Kai Ni form allows her to equip [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft|(Toku)]] [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]] and [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft + 11th Tank Regiment]].
