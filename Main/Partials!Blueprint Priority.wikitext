===List of ships requiring Blueprints for remodeling===
<!--DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT
This list is made and maintained by [[User:Tsubakura]]. When adding new ships, if you're unsure how high of a priority you have to give her, put up a question mark and put her at the top of the list, so that people notice that the new ship has been added to the list.

The hex color codes for each category is:
|style="background-color:#A5D6A7"|VERY HIGH
|style="background-color:#C8E6C9"|HIGH
|style="background-color:#FFE0B2"|MEDIUM
|style="background-color:#FFCDD2"|LOW
|style="background-color:#EF9A9A"|VERY LOW

|style="background-color:#A5D6A7"|Drops almost everywhere + constructable
|style="background-color:#C8E6C9"|Slightly more uncommon + constructable
|style="background-color:#FFE0B2"|Rare drop on maps and/or constructable
|style="background-color:#FFCDD2"|Only accessible through LSC, event only or limited drop
|style="background-color:#EF9A9A"|Event only
-->
The priority score is rated on the following points:
* What are the advantages you get in return for using the blueprint? Is she actually strong, do you get access to strong equipment, or is it both?
* How often can she be used? If she cannot be used in most maps, can she make a huge impact in maps where she can be used?
* Does her remodel come with disadvantages?
Keep in mind that the priorities might change depending on how far you are, what kind of ships you have available and what your current needs are, so keep the priorities only as rough guidelines. In case of times where the events are starting soon, consider saving your blueprint until you know what you actually need during the event.

While getting high priority ships are encouraged, do not recklessly pursue them in a way which will affect your fleet negatively and plan things out before committing yourself to something.

'''Note:''' The priority is listed from top to bottom, including those that are placed in the same category (e.g. {{ShipLink|Suzuya Kai Ni|text=Suzuya}} is ranked higher than {{ShipLink|Yura Kai Ni|text=Yura}}). However, the prioritization of ships in the same category is of less importance and you are free to disregard it and treat them all as equal priority if you wish.

===Ship girls whom put evaluation on hold===

*Akigumo Kai Ni

*Fusou &Yamashiro (Considering event maps, their priorities were down from high rank to low one.)
*Nagato &Mutsu (Naga/Mutsu Touch mechanic brings them both way up in worth and priority.)
