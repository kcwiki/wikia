==Character==
===Appearance===
* Both Fusou & [[Yamashiro]] sport a hair ornament that resembles a pagoda mast as they were widely known for [[wikipedia:Pagoda_mast|pagoda masts]] that stood 40 meters, or 130 feet, above the waterline.
** The height increased the visual spotting range by counteracting the planet's curvature, primarily for the main guns.

===Personality===
* She is constantly sighing & lamenting how unfortunate she is.
** Due to her history & [[#Trivia|word similarities]].
* A member of the [https://bato.to/read/_/221548/kantai-collection-kancolle-4-koma-comic-fubuki-ganbarimasu_ch26_by_zombies-ate-my-manga/6 'Unlucky Tea Ceremonies'].

==Notes==
* Received Kai Ni on October 24th, 2014.
* Remodeling her results in a class change to an [[List of Aviation Battleships by upgraded maximum stats|Aviation Battleship]].

==Trivia==
* ''Fusou'' is a classical title for Japan.
** 扶桑 (fusou) sounds similar to 不幸 (fukou) which means 'misfortune', & 不相応 (fusouou) which means 'misplaced' or 'unsuitable'.
* Japan's first Super-Dreadnought & the first to be completely indigenous as opposed to the, at the time, [[:Category:Kongou Class|Kongou class]] battlecruisers.
** Super dreadnoughts are an era within the [[wikipedia:Battleship|battleships]].
** Finished in 1915. As time passed, her design showed numerous faults that outweighed her merits despite initial high expectations, especially given her name, which led to endless modifications.
** Due to poor maintenance, sailors considered assignment to the [[:Category:Fusou Class|Fusou class]] to be the worst sea postings possible.
* The remodeling into an [[#Notes|Aviation Battleship]] stems from a plan for the [[:Category:Fusou Class|Fusou class]] after the carrier losses during the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Midway|''Battle of Midway'']]. However, it was performed on the [[:Category:Ise Class|Ise class]] instead.
* Sunk, possibly by [[wikipedia:USS_Melvin_(DD-680)|''USS Melvin'']], during night battle in the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Surigao_Strait|''Battle of Surigao Strait'']], October 25th, 1944.
* Wreck located in November 2017 by RV Petrel.([https://web.facebook.com/rvpetrel/photos/a.1532483526787123.1073741835.1510752248960251/1532483633453779/?type=3 while the second description now possibly corresponds to] [[Yamagumo]]'s demise). She is upside down on the bottom of Surigao Strait.
