A twin high-angle gun mount for vessel air defense developed in that country. It was equipped on large vessels as an air defense armament. Even on that aircraft carrier that repeatedly went between construction and work stoppage, it was planned to be equipped on the broadside and flight deck of the ship in superfiring arrangements.

10.5cm/65 SK C/33 was one of the dual-purpose guns used by the Kriegsmarine during WWII.
The gun entered service in 1935 and it was mainly used as an anti-aircraft gun on german warships.
It was used on the following classes of German ships: Bismarck-class, Scharnhorst-class, Deutschland-class, Admiral Hipper-class.
Aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin was planned to be equipped with these guns too, but that never came to pass as the carrier was not completed.
Number of these guns were also used by the French Navy in the 1951-1954 rebuilding of the reparation Italian light cruisers Scipione Africano (Guichen) and Attilio Regolo (Ch√†teaurenault). Before their refit the gunnery school ship, ex destroyer, Albatros experimentally carried one twin mounting until 1950.

The electrically powered tri-axial mounting of the turret was not watertight and that resulted in many problems, mainly with the electrical installations providing power to the turret.
