|Secretary 3/Note = This is a reference to the famous message sent from Ford Island during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor: "Air raid, Pearl Harbor.

Porter accidentally released a torpedo towards Iowa, and one radioman shouted: "Torpedo to starboard. This is not a drill...". Iowa was fast enough to avoid the torpedo.

==Character==

===Appearance===
*Iowa has long blonde hair and blue eyes with star-shaped pupils (as the typical American stereotype). She wears an outfit reminiscent of women featured on World War II American Navy pin-up posters and a pair of American flag-patterned leggings. The coloration of her costume also closely resembles the paint scheme of the real Iowa's deck.

*The design on the belt buckle of Iowa's normal art, and on the ''obi'' (sash) of her New Year's art, is the insignia for US Navy Officers signifying that a person is a senior or flag officer. [[wikipedia:Scrambled egg (uniform)|The insignia is typically worn as a gold emblem in front of an officer's cap.]]

===Personality===
*Iowa is portrayed as a playful American girl who uses a bilingual pattern of speech, similar to [[Kongou]], albeit with much heavier inclusion of English words and expressions. The bilingual pattern of speech is seen by Japanese community as resembling the [http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E8%AA%9E Lou language] used by [[:wikipedia:ja:ルー大柴|Lou Oshiba]].
*Takes great pride in being an American battleship and is not at all shy about demonstrating her firepower, as evident in her quotes.
*She's shown being good natured towards other Japanese ships with a friendly rivalry with [[Yamato]], though she appears to be unaware that "Hotel" isn't a flattering nickname for the latter.

==Notes==
*[[Spring_2016_Event/E-7|Spring 2016 Event E-7]] Clear Reward.
*Iowa is obtainable in the PlayStation Vita game [[KanColle Kai]] by clearing the game on "乙" (Otsu/Hard) difficulty or higher (note the game's difficulty system is translated differently in Vita game compare to the browser).
*When she was first introduced in the browser game, her maximum stat (along with [[Kamikaze]]'s) in her pre-Kai form may increase beyond her predetermined stat cap if she had been modernized beforehand. The extra maximum stats has been removed on 13th May 2016 in-event maintenance.
*[[ Winter 2018 Event/E-7|Winter 2018 Event/E-7]] Drop Node X.

==Trivia==
*Named after the [[wikipedia:Iowa|US state]].
*Iowa is the first US Navy ship introduced in Kantai Collection, initially appearing in the PS Vita game [[KanColle Kai]] before the PC version. She was introduced in the original PC browser game in the [[Spring 2016 Event]] as a reward for clearing E-7, the final map of that event.
**Her introduction was preceded by the appearance of the [[16inch Triple Gun Mount Mk.7]] in the [[Thread:387539|December 2015 Ranking Rewards]].
* Laid down on the 27th of June, 1940 at New York Naval Yard in Brooklyn, New York.
** Launched on August 27th, 1942, to much fanfare and publicity, as shown in newsreels. This in sharp contrast to [[Yamato]], whose launch was conducted in much secrecy.
** Commissioned on February 22, 1943.
*Compared to other ships who were either sunk, scuttled, shipwrecked, or sold for scrap, Iowa is the game's first personification of a currently intact and floating ship. Her historical counterpart was dismissed from active service in 1990 and is currently docked in the Port of Los Angeles as a museum ship. The other one is fellow compatriot ship [[Intrepid]].
*During ''[[wikipedia:Operation Hailstone|Operation Hailstone]]'' on February 19th, 1944, ''USS Iowa'' (BB-61) along with her sister ship ''USS New Jersey'' (BB-62) fired upon and sank the Japanese training cruiser [[Katori]].
**In some fan materials, this manifests as [[Katori]] being fearful or vengeful towards her, though attempts at vengeance end up failing, often with humorous results.
* Following World War II, she was decommissioned in early 1949, then recommissioned in 1951 for Korean War service. She was again decommissioned in 1958, before once again being recommissioned as part of Ronald Regan's "500 Ship" plan, then decommissioned for the final time in 1990. After languishing for years as part of the mothball fleet in Suisun Bay near Fairfield, California, she became a museum ship in San Pedro, California in 2012.
** She earned the nicknames "The Big Stick" and "The Grey Ghost", due to her reputation in destroying North Korean gun positions off the Korean coast.
