===Tips===
*At least 3 SS(V) are required to reach the boss.
* This map uses the [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=4)]] formula, this means that '''LoS from equipments weights 4 times more''' than usual.
*There are LoS checks E -> F and F -> K. They do not have high LoS requirements (SSVs with a couple recon planes will pass), but an all-sub fleet without recon planes will be sent to H.
*LoS requirements to reach the boss node are lower if the fleet contains {{ShipLink|Taigei}}:
** Required LoS value if the fleet contains {{ShipLink|Taigei}}: [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=4)]] ≧ 25
** Required LoS value if the fleet does not contain {{ShipLink|Taigei}}: [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=4)]] ≧ 36
* To trigger Night Scout at boss node, you need either Air Denial (28-56 FP), Air Superiority (126+ FP) or Air Supremacy. Night Scouts cannot be triggered if the day combat is done in Air Parity (with 57-125 FP when the boss battle starts).
===Possible Fleet compositions===
*{{Event/Route|B|red|D|red|E|blue|F|red|K|red}}
**[https://kc3kai.github.io/kancolle-replay/battleplayer.html?fromImg=http://i.imgur.com/5O7tMsz.png 1CLT 1CL 1CV(L) 3SS(V)]
***an effective fleet for taking out the boss but it will have to go through node B where there's a Ru-class BB. Note that this fleet can send you to dead end node H.
*{{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|D|red|E|blue|F|red|K|red}}
**6SS(V)
***An all-sub fleet will reach the boss with sufficient LoS, however, node C is pretty harsh on subs with late-model DDs and flagship CLs.
***{{ShipLink|Taigei}} in a sub fleet avoids the battle in Node C by leading the fleet to node A -> D which can be very helpful. When she is equipped with recon seaplanes, she then allows all your subs to equip torpedoes while passing the LoS check.
*{{Event/Route|A|blue|D|red|E|blue|F|red|K|red}}
**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbr2qHNb_3o Taigei 1CL 4SS(V)]
***another possible way to clear this map and also quest [[Quests#B91|B91]] with {{ShipLink|Taigei}} loaded with bulges and recons. CL recommended are {{ShipLink|Ooyodo Kai}} for extra slot or {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}} for opening torpedo.
*{{Event/Route|B|red|D|red|E|blue|H|red}} '''(for farming node H)'''
** 1BB 3CLT 1CL 1CV
** 1CL 3CLT 2CV
***Pattern 1 on node H has a chance to drop {{ShipLink|I-401}}.
***Both fleets guarantee the routing to node H and are good enough to get S Rank.
