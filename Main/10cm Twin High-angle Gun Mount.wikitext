Main weapon for AA destroyers. The groundbreaking long-barrel semi-automatic loaded gun mounted on turret, popularly known as "Long 10 cm", equipped on Akizuki-class destroyers. Its complex structure made it difficult to mass-produce, but it's a silver bullet against enemy aircraft.

* Not to be confused with the [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount (Carriage)]].

One of Japan's relatively successful anti-air weapon, being equipped on carrier [[Taihou]], light cruiser [[Ooyodo]] and Akizuki-class destroyers (the illustration shows the turret-mounted variant seen on Akizuki-class; Ooyodo and Taihou were equipped with [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount (Carriage)|carriage-mounted ones]]). Both muzzle velocity and operating speed were increased significantly compared to [[12.7cm Twin Gun Mount|traditional destroyer guns]], making it more effective against enemy aircraft. Its anti-surface ability was not as high due to accuracy and ammunition mass but in-game it has the same firepower stat as the twin 12.7 cm. Although the gun proved effective, the IJN's anti-air ability still lagged behind as the anti-air fire control device was outdated. 

It is easily accessible in-game as most destroyers carry it as stock equipment upon remodel; Chief Developer Kensuke Tanaka once regretted that this weapon "was deployed rather too early, even before the Akizuki-class appeared in-game" in an interview.<sup class="plainlinks">[http://kancolle-news.com/archives/41283693.html <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</sup>
