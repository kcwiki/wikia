==Tips==
*The heavier the fleet, the longer the route. This map will require you to bring some DD/CL if you wish for a short and viable path.
*Maelstrom node {{Event/Route|F|purple}} can either wipe all of your ship's remaining fuel or 2 bars of remaining fuel. Bringing [[List of Radars by stats|Radars]] will help reduce fuel loss here.
==Compositions==
*{{Event/Route|D|purple|H|red|L|blue|J|blue|P|red}}
** 3-5 DD 0-1 CA(V) 1-3 CL
***Having more than 1 CA(V) is possible but can randomly route you to {{Event/Route|G|red}} instead of {{Event/Route|L|blue}}
***With only 1 battle prior to boss, this is the shortest yet risky route to boss. Unless you have {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai|text=Seaplane Fighters}} on your CAV, you will be facing boss under AI. You will almost likely rely on night battle to at least B-rank the map so plan accordingly with {{EquipmentLink|Searchlight|Star Shell|text=night battle equipment}}.
*{{Event/Route|A|red|C|red|E|green|G|red|J|blue|P|red}}
**2 CV(B) 2 CVL 1 CL 1 AV
***Fixed routing, requires CL and AV to go to node E which gives you bauxite.
***Standard composition for anyone who dislike light comps or don't have enough boiler to form a '''Fast+''' fleet
**3 (F)BB(V) 1 CV(B) 1CL 1AV
***It's possible to exchange only 1 (F)BB(V) for 1 CV(B)
*{{Event/Route|A|red|C|red|F|purple|J|blue|P|red}}
** 1 CVL 2 CV(B) 1 CL 2 DD ('''All Fast+''')
***Fixed routing, but all ships must have '''Fast+ (高速+)''' as their Speed.
***As you only engage two battles preboss, you will have no ammo penalty at the boss node.
