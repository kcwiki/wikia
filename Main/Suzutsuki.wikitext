==Trivia==
* Her name means "Clear Moon (in Autumn)".
* Suzutsuki was revealed with accompanying character illustration at the 4th Kancolle Naval Review on 16 September 2017. 
*Suzutsuki later participated in the ill-fated Operation Ten-Go. Suzutsuki was one of the few ships to survive the ordeal despite extensive damage, alongside [[Hatsushimo]], [[Yukikaze]] and Fuyuzuki.
* After the war, her hull, along with the hulls of another two destroyers Fuyuzuki and Yanagi (the one built in 1917, not the one built in 1945), was used as part of a breakwater (known as the "Military Ship Breakwater (軍艦防波堤)" in Japan) in Wakamatsu port in northern Kyushu which is now part of Kitakyushu city. [http://blog.livedoor.jp/irootoko_jr/archives/1400919.html]
** Due to extensive repair works after a typhoon damaged the breakwater in 1961, the hulls of Suzutsuki and Fuyuzuki are completely underground today (hence the name "'''Entombed''' Anti-Air Guardian Princess" for her Abyssal counterpart).
* Along with [[Shimakaze]], [[Amatsukaze]], [[Akizuki]], [[Teruzuki]] and [[Hatsuzuki]], she is one of 6 Destroyers with "sentient turrets".
* Once again in the JMSDF era, she is a sister ship of the modern Akizuki-class destroyers, JS Sutsuzuki (DD-117).
**Her Kancolle likeness, along with Inazuma and Kaga has been made into mascots of their namesakes, seen in various visual guides inside the ships. This was seen in their Southeast Asian Deployment billboards where the trio visited Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines, among others.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/warshipGF/photos/a.1665808446975791/2318328308390465/?type=3&permPage=1</ref> A figure of her was even seen aboard the ship.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/warshipGF/photos/pcb.2318336028389693/2318327465057216/?type=3&theater</ref>
