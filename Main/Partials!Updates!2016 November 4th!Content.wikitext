=== [[Mackerel|Sanma 2016]] ===
* End of [[Seasonal/Sanma 2016|Mackerel 2016]] mini-event.


=== [[Kinu#Second_Upgrade|Kinu Kai Ni]] ===
{{SeasonalGallery|slideshow=true|Kinu/Kai Ni}}
* Requires [[Blueprint]]
* Remodels at Level 75
* Can equip [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]] (all variants) and [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]]s. However, she is unable to carry [[Kouhyouteki]] mini-subs, making her unable to perform opening torpedo attacks unlike her sister ship [[Abukuma]].  
* Also gains a passive 5% [[Expedition/Introduction#Landing_Craft|bonus to expedition incomes]], identical to the effect provided by [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]]. This innate bonus stacks with any Daihatsu Landing Craft equipped on Kinu, up to the 20% maximum resource gain cap on expeditions.
