==Notes==
* It was announced that [[Kyoufuu Kai]] and/or [[Type 0 Fighter Model 63 (Fighter-bomber)]] will become obtainable and improvable in the next update (April 5th).
* The next update is most likely a Suzuya Kai Ni update, with [[Type 0 Fighter Model 63 (Fighter-bomber)]] fairy being Suzuya, it's ''speculated'' that Suzuya will become CVL or will be able to equip dive bombers.
