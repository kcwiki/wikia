==Notes==
The '''New Technology Aircraft Blueprint''' (新型航空機設計図) is a special item required to construct the [[Kikka Kai]] Jet aircraft. This item can be acquired from Quest [[Quests#D20|D20]] and [[Quests#G5|G5]].

== Trivia ==
In-game, it is required to complete expedition 30 to obtain the blueprint as this is suppose to be a loose recreation of the voyage U-234 made from Germany to Japan to deliver an Me 262 jet, Hs 293 glide bomb and uranium oxide. In real life, U-234 failed to reach Japan since all U-boats were ordered to surface and surrender by German command after Hitler's suicide.
