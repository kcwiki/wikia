{{clear}}
===Phase 1: HP gauge at node N===
*The first boss of this map is {{ShipLink|Heavy Cruiser Princess}} in an [[Combat/Abyssal Combined Fleet| abyssal combined fleet]].
**To be able to fight the main fleet, a large majority of the escort must be sunk (see page above for more info). Otherwise, the escort will be fought instead.
**'''HARD MODE''': the boss will be in its new forms (VII and VIII) exclusively for this difficulty, which gives her an extremely high armor boost. Consider bringing [[Combat/Equipment Guide|Torpedo Cut-in]] setups if you are having difficulty sinking the boss during '''LAST DANCE'''.
*Route:{{Event/Route|B|red|F|blue|I|orange|L|red|N|red}}
**'''Surface task force (STF)''': 1fBB 2CVL 3CA(V) + 1CL 3DD 1CA(V) 1CLT
***must be '''fast fleet''' to avoid routing through extra nodes.
***460~ airpower is recommended for easier time at preboss nodes.
***AACI setup is also recommended to mitigate airstrike damage.
*'''LBAS''':It is recommended to send two squadrons filled with 3 [[List of Land-based Attack Aircraft by stats|Land-based bombers]] and 1 Fighter/Interceptor to the boss node {{Event/Route|N|Red}}.
**The boss requires planes with range 7+. Scout planes can be used to increase the squadrons' range if necessary.

===Phase 1.5: Unlocking the second starting point===
*It is required to visit certain nodes in order to unlock a second starting point which makes reaching the phase 2 boss node {{Event/Route|R|red}} much easier. This must be done after you defeated the first boss. The following steps can be done in any order:
*Achieve S rank at node {{Event/Route|O|red}}
**Route:{{Event/Route|A|red|D|red|E|Orange|H|blue|J|red|O|red}}
***'''Carrier task force (CTF)''': 3CV(L/B) 1XX 2CA(V) + 1CL 3DD 1CA(V) 1CLT
****must be '''fast fleet''' and cannot have more than 3 (F)BB(V)+CV(L/B) combined.
****A CV(L/B) can be changed for a (F)BB(V) to skip E node.
*Visit the air defense node {{Event/Route|I|orange}} and achieve Air Superiority (AS) or above. '''(NOT REQUIRED ON CASUAL/EASY)'''
**Route:{{Event/Route|B|red|F|blue|I|orange}}
***'''STF''': 1fBB 2CVL 3CA(V) + 1CL 3DD 1CA(V) 1CLT
****this step uses the same fleet required to clear phase 1, bring enough fighters to achieve AS at node {{Event/Route|I|orange}}.
****'''NOTE''': Having achieved AS at this node already during phase 1 does not count for the unlock!
*Visit the air defense node {{Event/Route|E|orange}} and achieve '''AS+''' for Hard. '''(NOT REQUIRED ON CASUAL/EASY/MEDIUM)'''
**Route:{{Event/Route|A|red|D|red|E|Orange}}
***'''CTF''': 3CV(L/B) 1XX 2CA(V) + 1CL 3DD 1CA(V) 1CLT
****Same fleet as the last step, send LBAS to help achieving '''AS+''' (air power 834 in HARD).
***'''NOTE''': this step and S rank at node O can be done at the same time!

===Phase 2: HP phase at node R===
*The second boss of this map is an [[Combat/Installation Type|Installation type]] enemy in an abyssal combined fleet.
*As usual, bringing a ship capable of AACI is highly recommended especially during this phase because of node {{Event/Route|J|Red}}.
*There are currently two ways to tackle this phase using either a CTF or a STF. The CTF guarantees the best routing to the boss by skipping node {{Event/Route|O|red}} but requires a '''fast fleet''' and an [[List of auxiliary ships by upgraded maximum stats|AO]] in the fleet, while STF has no such limitations but goes through node {{Event/Route|O|Red}} before the boss node.
*Route:{{Event/Route|2|black|S|red|H|blue|J|red|P|orange|O|red|R|red}}
**'''STF''': 1(F)BB(V) 2CVL 3XX + 1CL 2DD 2CA(V) 1XX
***cannot contain a CV(B) or it will start from the first starting point.
***cannot contain more than 4 (F)BB(V) + CV(L) or it will offroute to node L
***There is an LOS check to go from {{Event/Route|O|red}} to boss node {{Event/Route|R|red}}.
*Route:{{Event/Route|2|black|S|red|H|blue|J|red|P|orange|R|red}}
**'''CTF''': 1AO 4CV(L/B) 1CA(V) + 1CL 3DD 2CA(V) '''(MUST BE FAST FLEET)'''
***can swap a carrier for a (F)BB(V).
***can remove a carrier in main fleet to have a FBB in escort.
*It is highly recommended (or mandatory if higher difficulty) to use as many historical ships as you can for this phase, {{ShipLink|Gangut|Gangut Dva|text=Gangut}} as a FBB in escort works especially well (beware of her speed if using CTF!).
*Bring your best anti-installation gear available. Please visit the [[Combat/Installation Type|related page]] and the [[Combat/Equipment Guide|equipment guide page]] for more details.
**The use of a {{WG42}} + {{LandingCraft}} + {{SpecialAmphibiousTank}} combo on a CL/AV/DD/AO in your main fleet can deal enough damage to sink {{ShipLink|Supply Depot Princess}} in one hit.
**{{ShipLink|Artillery Imp}} are vulnerable to all anti-installation gear except {{GreenAmmo}}.
**Main fleet BBs might consider equipping a {{RedAmmo}} instead of {{GreenAmmo}} to help deal with the preboss nodes and be able to damage {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp}}.
**For the ships in the escort fleet, CAs and FBB should have a {{GreenAmmo}} equipped, for CAVs a {{GreenAmmo}} + {{WG42}} setup can be considered if available.
**Aircraft carriers '''CANNOT''' attack installations if they have a {{DiveBomb icon}} equipped '''UNLESS''' it's one of the bombers from the following list:
***{{EquipmentLink|Prototype Nanzan}}
***{{EquipmentLink|F4U-1D}}
***{{EquipmentLink|FM-2}}
***{{EquipmentLink|Ju 87C Kai}}
***{{EquipmentLink|Ju 87C Kai Ni (w/ KMX)}}
***{{EquipmentLink|Ju 87C Kai Ni (w/ KMX/Skilled)}}
***{{EquipmentLink|Suisei Model 12 (634 Air Group w/ Type 3 Cluster Bombs)}}
**Aircraft carriers will not be able to perform [[Combat/Day Combat|CVCI]] against the installations.
*Refer to the following list for the ships able to equip {{LandingCraft}} and/or {{SpecialAmphibiousTank}}:

{{Hard Anti-installation Weapons}}
*'''LBAS''': It is recommended to send two squadrons filled with 3 [[List of Land-based Attack Aircraft by stats|Land-based bombers]] and 1 Fighter/Interceptor to the boss node {{Event/Route|R|Red}}, sending a base to {{Event/Route|J|Red}} during pre last dance runs can also be considered.
**The boss requires planes with range 6+.
**[[List of Land-based Attack Aircraft by stats|Land-based bombers]] deal extremely high damage to {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp}} and {{ShipLink|Supply Depot Princess}}!

===[[Friend Fleet]]s===
[[File:Friend Fleet Usage.png|thumb]]

'''NOTE:''' friend fleets are disabled by default! Please toggle it on before proceeding!

Friend fleet must be manually toggled from the Home port (see the image) in order for it to appear at the boss node. You can request for a stronger friend fleet at the price of 6 flamethrowers; however, the definition of "stronger fleet" is still unknown.
