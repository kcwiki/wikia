An anti-torpedo bulge is a form of passive defense for ships, meant to defend themselves against torpedo attacks. It involved fitting (or retrofitting) partially water-filled compartmentalized sponsons on either side of a ship's hull, intended to detonate torpedoes, absorb their explosions, and contain flooding to damaged areas within the bulges.
