==Character==

===Appearance===
* The Hiyou class wears a white blouse with red trimmings over a red dress shirt referencing their past as army-subsidized luxury passenger ships and a magatama for their tops. Their bottoms are a wide red hakama trimmed to calf-length and wear platform shoes. Their flight decks are scrolls while the airplanes are shikigami, controlled as onmyouji.
** Hiyou, herself, has long black hair in a hime-cut accessorized with a hair ribbon.

===Personality===
*Hiyou somewhat acts as a foil towards Jun'you, in that she is the more responsible of the two. Hiyou shows genuine elation if fitted with new equipment, similar to [[Choukai]].
