===Nelson Touch===
{{ShipLink|Nelson}} has a special attack known as Nelson Touch, wherein Nelson and 2 other ships in the 3rd & 5th position in the fleet will attempt to attack multiple enemies at once.
====Activation Requirements====
*Nelson must be Flagship (in Combined Fleet, Main Fleet flagship)
*Nelson must not be at ''chuuha'' or ''taiha'' state.
*Fleet must be in '''Double Line Formation''' (in Combined Fleet, '''Cruising Formation 2 (Forward)''').
*Fleet must have 6 ships.
*No submarines (SS/SSV) allowed in fleet (Main for Combined Fleet)
*No carriers (CV/L/B) in 3rd or 5th position.
*Must not be in a PvP (exercise) battle.
====Cut-In Behavior====
*Upon activation, 3 singular attacks against randomly selected enemies will be performed. The flagship, 3rd and 5th ship will attempt the attacks in succession.
**May not target submarines, even if participating ships are normally forced to attack them.

*All the above modifiers stack multiplicatively.
**The multiplier is treated as '''post-cap''' in day battle, and as '''pre-cap''' in night battle.
*Can trigger at both day (first or second shelling rounds) and night battle.
*This attack may only trigger once per '''sortie''' (not once per battle).
**If the cut-in is not performed during battle, it can still be used in following battles.
*Unlike other Big Seven special attacks, Nelson Touch does not cost additional resources.
*Trigger rate is dependent on the combined level of all three ships involved.<ref>https://twitter.com/kurosg/status/1066500227945816065?s=09</ref>

==Trivia==
*She is named after British vice admiral Horatio Nelson.
*Designed and built in the wake of the Washington Naval Treaty, the two Nelson class ships were part of the 'Big Seven' battleships allowed to carry 16" guns. As a result of the weight limits she focused on firepower over speed.
*Entering service in 1927 she was not modernised before the war and so while still a formidable gunship her speed severely limited her effectiveness. War repairs and refits increased her AA.
*She had a mixed career, spending much of it in repairs (she hit mines in '39, was torpedoed in '41 and struck mines again in '44) but saw her main action in the Mediterranean escorting convoys to Malta and bombardment actions for Operation Torch, Sicily landings and Salerno. She also supported the Normandy landings and in the final months of the war operated against the Japanese off Malaya.
*Both the Italian Armistice and the surrender of Japanese forces in Malaya were signed on her.
*"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nelson_Touch The Nelson Touch] " is a historical term, but refers not to the warship, but her namesake, specifically either the naval strategy he used to great success, or the overall sense of naval superiority the British Navy enjoyed during the 1800s, which Vice Admiral Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar ushered in.
*She served as a training ship after the war, and was used as a target ship before being broken up in 1949.
