==Notes==
{{:Kongou/Special Cut-In}}

==Character==
[[File:Anime hiei.png|thumb|250px]]

===Appearance===

===Personality===
*Very boisterous, especially when compared to her sisters [[Haruna]] and [[Kirishima]]. She is notorious for her terrible cooking skills.
*She adores her class' nameship, [[Kongou]].
*She lets out a "Hieee" when surprised or hit. This particular way of reacting is based on her name.

==Trivia==
*Hiei was the only one of the Kongou sisters to have her superstructure mast reconstructed into a similar prototype to be used on the Yamato class.
*Named after Mount Hiei
* Received her Kai Ni on 20/11/2013.
*She was extensively damaged during the first [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal Naval Battle of Guadalcanal], after which she was found and sunk by an aircraft from USS Enterprise on November 14 1942, making her the first battleship lost by the IJN during WWII.
**During her last hours Hiei's crew was fighting with all their might to keep the vessel operational, despite constant attacks by American aircraft, losing and regaining power multiple times.
**Her captain, Nishida Masao stubbornly refused to abandon and scuttle her multiple times, despite direct orders from Vice Admiral Abe.
**When the report about the last boiler being flooded came and abandonment orders were finally given, it's said that Captain Nishida watched over the evacuation sitting in his favourite chair atop one of Hiei's turrets and did not move even during American aircraft strafing run. Later he was forcibly removed from the ship.
* Wreck '''<u>possibly</u>''' found by Dr. Robert Ballard in 1993. There is discussion whether or not the wreck is her or [[Kirishima]]...[http://www.combinedfleet.com/atully03.htm]
**Later found and decisively confirmed by RV Petrel on February 4, 2019. She rests nearly a kilometer upside down, and contrary to claims, is 4 nautical miles apart from Kirishima.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/rvpetrel/photos/a.2185795551455914/2185797874789015/?type=3&permPage=1</ref>
* Served as the emperor's transport mid-1930
