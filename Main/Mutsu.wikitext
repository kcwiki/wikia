|Library/En = Battleship Nagato class's second ship and from there (referring to her name), Mutsu.<br>Of course, I'm part of the world's Big 7.<br>Ehh? The gunpowder explosion accident?<br>Well, can't cover it up anymore right? This time will be fine!
|Library/Note = Mutsu was named after the Mutsu province and was part of the Big 7 battleships (Nagato and herself; UK battleships Nelson and Rodney; and the US battleships Colorado, Maryland, and West Virginia), hence her introduction. She was sunk when a fire in her third gun turret caused an explosion (see above). The Japanese covered the explosion up to prevent a loss of morale, hence her lines here.

|Secretary 3/En = Like I said,  I told you to stop playing with fire inside me! Hey, are you listening?

==Notes==
{{:Nagato/Special Cut-In}}

==Character==
[[File:Anime mutsu.png|thumb|right|250px]]

===Appearance===
On her head is her peculiar headgear which features the various details of the top of her main tower.

===Personality===
*Mutsu is depicted as a foil to Nagato, being seductive and demure, instead of being serious. She, like various other shipgirls, has a catchphrase, with hers being "あら" (Ara), meaning "Oh my".
*In the anime, Mutsu is shown to be calm and collected in times of crisis and sadness. She can be seen comforting the Secretary Ship Nagato towards the end of Episode 3 after the Naval District's attempt at a surprise attack on W Island failed and [[Kisaragi|a fellow fleet girl]] was sunk. As the anime progresses towards the middle of its season, she receives somewhat of a leap in screen time along with Nagato. She uses this screen time to repeatedly undo Nagato's cool and collected personality and to tease her. She repeatedly flirts with the Secretary Ship and she even went as far as to call Nagato, "Mine". She has openly admitted to Nagato that she holds affection/love for her. She is almost always with Nagato, with rare instances otherwise. There are no current instances where she has been seen alone alongside other fleet girls.

==Trivia==
*She sunk due to an internal explosion on 8 June 1943. Most of the wreckage was salvaged between the mid-50's to 1970's.
*She formerly had the lowest luck among all ships (before Taihou was added) as she sank without experiencing real battles (see above for details).
*As built her armament included torpedo launcher (8 × 533 mm (21.0 in) torpedo tube) but it was later removed during her 1934 reconstruction, however this was not reflected in the game.
*She is named after the Mutsu province which existed before Meiji period (Mutsu province was divided into five with one called the 'Rikuoh province' written with the same kanji as the former Mutsu province). Currently, today's Aomori prefecture, Iwate prefecture, Miyagi prefecture, and Fukushima prefecture.
*She is often compared to a snail or slug due to her horn-like headgear and a pun between her name and snail. As snail in Japanese is かたつむり (katatsumuri), and when reversed, produces りむつたか (rimutsutaka), a simple substitution produces "り'''陸奥'''たか (ri'''mutsu'''taka)", with [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=208004 Blew] being the origin of the [http://40.media.tumblr.com/9223ddcc554e43c8aa50237cde7316ad/tumblr_inline_no55sxVnSB1r74tvd_500.png related drawing.]
