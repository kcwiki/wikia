==Trivia==
*Combat loss May 5, 1942 at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Tulagi_%28May_1942%29 Invasion of Tulagi] ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Kikuzuki&params=09_07_S_160_12_E_ 09°07′S 160°12′E]). She was attacked by aircraft from USS Yorktown and while under tow sank near the shore off Florida Island. In 1943 crews from USS Prometheus re-floated her and towed her to Tokyo Bay, where she was beached and studied by US intelligence for over a year. In December 1944 she was again re-floated and towed to her to her final resting place in Purvis Bay, where she was abandoned and allowed to sink in shallow water. Much like Guadacanal and the waters encompassing the entire Solomon Islands, it is a protected war grave.
**The remains of her wreck are visible in satellite images via [https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E9%A7%86%E9%80%90%E8%89%A6%E8%8F%8A%E6%9C%88/@-9.1238377,160.2374447,418m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfa7aea57dadb00b2!6m1!1e1 Google]. She has been heavily salvaged over the subsequent years and very little of her remains. Her rusted hull however seems to be intact despite being eaten over by the elements.
**Kikuzuki's main guns were retrieved from her in an effort beginning 2016 for restoration and display in Maizuru base.<ref>https://twitter.com/kikuzuki_hozon/status/904908750988836864</ref> The actual retrieval occurred in 2017. 
*Her name literally means "Chrysanthemum Moon", and refers to the ninth month of the Lunar Calendar.
**That name was first carried by the twenty-ninth ship of the first Kamikaze class in 1908.
