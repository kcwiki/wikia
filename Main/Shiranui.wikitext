==Character==

===Appearance===
*Shiranui wears a similar uniform to most members of the Asashio-class, as the Kagerou-class was based on the Asashio-class. She wears a school uniform-esque garment with a vest, red tie and black shorts underneath her skirt. She has pink hair tied into a bun with a blue hairpiece securing it.

===Personality===
*Serious, stoic and has a bit of bloodlust in battle, Shiranui acts as a foil to her sister [[Kagerou]]. Shiranui is also seen to be rather cold and reserved, and is often seen giving a nonchalant or deadpan expression in various forms of art or literature involving her. She rarely speaks in a hospitable manner or even smile.

==Trivia==
*Sunk in action, 27 October 1944, while she was trying to save a stranded [[Hayashimo]] in Semirara Island. Her unexplored wreckage lies south of Sibuyan Island, Philippines.
**Reborn as an Asahi-class destroyer of the JMSDF, JS Shiranui (DD-120)
*Her name means "phosphorescent light", and may refer to mysterious lights seen at sea.
**It was first carried by the fourth ship of the Murakumo class Torpedo Boat Destroyers in 1898.

==Quests==
* Required by quests [[Quests#A30|A30]], [[Quests#A32|A32]] and [[Quests#B21|B21]].
