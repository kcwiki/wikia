}}

==Character==
===Appearance===
*[[Souryuu]] and Hiryuu, being originally designed as sister ships, share many similarities. Namely, they wear color-differentiated versions of the same clothes.
**Hiryuu wears a yellow kimono top, with the bottom of the sleeves fading to gray with red stripes. Her bottom is a green pleated skirt. She also wears a flight deck apron like [[Akagi]] and [[Kaga]] (the kana "ヒ" is inscribed on it, referring to her real-life identification mark). Her full flight deck is attached to her left arm. Unlike most other archer carriers, she doesn't wear muneate.
*She has short brown hair.
* The hole on her Kai Ni CG's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hiry%C5%AB#mediaviewer/File:Hiryu_burning.jpg flight deck] when she gets damaged is a reference to the damage her real-life counterpart sustained when she was targeted by planes, some of which were Yorktown survivors, launched from the USS Enterprise. [http://www.midway42.org/TheBattle/Images/Hiryu-Bomb-Hits.png She was struck by bombs] which caused the forward portion of her flight deck to cave in. Although her propulsion was unaffected and she wasn't holed, the fires from the attack were uncontrollable. She was scuttled by torpedoes from Makigumo and it took some time before she sunk as reported by one of Houshou's aircraft.
=== Personality===
*One of three "fluffy dragons", along with Souryuu.
**She, along with Souryuu and Unryuu, has been nicknamed the "fluffy dragons" because of their generally soft and womanly appearance.
*More cheerful than Souryuu.
*She constantly mentions about Tamon-maru (Tamon Yamaguchi).

==Trivia==
*Her name translates to "flying dragon".
*She has exceptionally high luck probably because at the Battle of Midway, she survived the initial US air attacks that sank the Akagi, Kaga and Souryuu. Her planes raided and indirectly sank the U.S. Carrier Yorktown (Hiryuu herself was later sunk, too. Yorktown was damaged by Hiryuu's attack and later sank together with DD Hammann by [[I-168]]'s torpedoes).
*At 34.3 knots, she was the fastest carrier in the world at the time of her commissioning.
