The Daihatsus are mainly amphibious vehicles which are used aboard large troopships or assault landing ships to conduct an amphibious assault. Outside of offensive operations, they are used to transport troops and equipment.

In-game, these equipment are used to increase resources gained from expeditions and resource nodes, while also dealing extra damages against [[Combat/Installation Type|Installation]] bosses who have a weakness against it.
