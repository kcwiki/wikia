==Information Update==
*The developers have announced the specific details to gain the debuff effect in E6:
**Clearing any of the following two nodes once with a S Rank will result in an increase of Aerial Attack Capability against Central Princess
***E-5-I, E-6-A/G/L
**Clearing all four nodes will result in a slightly further increase in Aerial Attack Ability against Central Princess, and doing so would also change her initial appearance voiceline.
*Another offline Emergency maintenance was performed on [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/730919335498113025 May the 13th] to fix numerous issues:
**Stat cap bug (Maxing the new ships stats through modernization while un-kai'd would cause leveling them to ignore the stat limits) [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/731041661799653377 was] [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/731042475305930752 fixed].
**Married HP for New Kanmusu [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/731042128692797440 was fixed] (They were lower than intended).
**[[Pola Kai]] can equip [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/731044365280280576 Seaplane Fighters].
**Players now have an [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/731045825430740992 increased chance] to meet [[Oyashio]].
**Fixed the bug that under certain conditions, LBAS planes' airplane profiency would not increase after combat.
**Various [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/731043367417565184 display] fixes.

|
*Previous bugs about enemy air raid not occurring and reduced friendly air base attack power against enemy bosses being too weak have been fixed.
**When you sortie to '''E-5''' or '''E-7''' now, it's possible for abyssals to '''raid your air base and hurt your resource/planes'''. It's possible to mitigate the damage by setting one of your land base air squadron's to Anti-Air and putting interceptor and fighter planes into that squadron, but if you think having one more land base air squadron is important in helping you clear the map and you have extra resources to spare (resources lost will be around a hundred or so fuel and a bit of the other resources per enemy air raid), you can still bring all of your land base air squadrons with you and ignore the enemy air raid instead.
----
*Currently, there are bugs in the Extra Operation and Latter Operation which prevent the enemy air raids from occurring and friendly side air base squadron from hitting enemy bosses hard enough.
*Devs will apply patches at (JST May 5 08:30-10:00 am)
**It will be an '''offline maintenance''' which means you will be unable to access the game during the maintenance period. Please setup your expeditions, dock and akashi before the maintenance.
*Everyone can get an apology wall scroll after the event ends
*Everyone who reached the Latter Stage Operation (i.e., E6) ''before the maintenance (May 5 JST 08:30 am)'' can get a wall scroll and an early implementation land base aircraft that could otherwise be obtained this summer, after the event ends.
*Everyone who reached the Latter Stage Operation (i.e., E6) ''before the announcement'' (around May 4 JST 7:16 am) can get a special furniture, after the event ends.
*It seems like that you have to fight in the map at least once to be counted as "reaching the map".

==Difficulty Selection==

*If you answer "No" for "Are you aiming for all rewards", the answer is "Do a variant of Easy/Medium/Hard depending on your choice!". Well....I can expand it to help you decide what you should go for but if I do that then you should go back to your cradle. *cough* I'm lazy *cough*

*There's definitely Loop-problem in the whole "Ship drop" section. Will be fixed by next time.

*P.S. Ship locks are applied on ALL difficulties, but they won't be 'enforced' on Easy difficulty.
