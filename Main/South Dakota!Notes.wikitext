===Appearance===


Her flamboyant hair style and her holding a flagpole refers to her design as a flagship from the outset.

Due to her design as a flagship, she only has 8 twin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5%22/38_caliber_gun 5in/38 cal ]secondary guns(2 fewer than her sisters), in exchange for 1 extra level on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conning_tower conning tower]. Because of this unique trait, while most other battership girls in game sport a hair ornament that resembles top of their superstructure, South Dakota would wear her conning tower as, one can only describe, a 15-inch thick steel helmet. The top of her flagpole would resemble top of her superstructure. ([http://navsource.org/archives/01/057/015724f.jpg Closeup image of South Dakota's superstructure])

First half of her radio call sign, November[[File:November.jpg|16px|link=]]- Echo[[File:Echo.jpg|16px|link=]], is seen on her right shoulder. Persumably second half of her call sign, Bravo[[File:Bravo.jpg|16px|link=]]-Charlie[[File:Charlie.jpg|16px|link=]] , is on the other.

There is an eletrical switch on the left side of her gear, which can be observed more clearly on her damaged art. In her kai art, a yellow warning stripe is taped over the switch, referring to her infamous short circuit incident during the [https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/world-war-ii/1942/guadalcanal/naval-battle-of-guadalcanal/guadalcanal-historical-summary.html second naval battle of Guadalcanal].

From base art to kai, her outfit and gear changes color scheme to deck blue, referring to her historial counterpart adopted [https://www.shipcamouflage.com/measure_21.htm MS21] camouflage for majority of her career.

==Trivia==
*She was laid down on the 5th July 1939 and launched just under two years later 7th June '41. She entered service in March '42.
*Designed as the naval treaties began to fall apart she was redesigned to have heavier armour and 16" guns, however funding was limited so she and her sisters retained the treaty designed hulls and wre rather cramped ships.
*Enroute to the Pacific theater she ran aground and had to be docked. Despite being a brand new ship she still underwent a refit to improve her AA.
*Her first active service was the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, where her newly reinforced AA suite proved its worth accounting for several Japanese planes.She took some damage as well as her Captain being wounded though both healed quickly back at port.
*With the US carrier presence reduced to just ''Enterprise'' following the battle she and ''Washington'' were formed into a fast task group to defend the Guadacanal area. They did not have to wait long for the next day a force of destroyers, cruisers and ''[[Kirishima]]'' were detected and the ships moved to engage. However just before the ships sighted each other in the dark she suffered a major electrical failure putting her radar and most of her guns effectively out of order, she was soon spotted by the Japanese force and took the full brunt of their attacks - though her superstructure was ruined rendering her combat ineffective her hull was undamaged, and her unintentional distraction allowed ''Washington'' to catch up and cripple the ''[[Ayanami]]'' and ''Kirishima'', turning the Japanese away.
*Following her repairs she briefly saw service in the Atlantic with the British Home Fleet, however no German sortie occured and she was sent back to the Pacific.From here onwards she escorted carriers and took part in bombardments, proving her skills in AA fire on numerous occasions, including the Battle of the Phillipine Sea and Leyte Gulf.
*She would engage the Japanese home islands in the final year of the war, bombarding Okinawa, Iwo Jima and Japan itself.
*She continued to serve post-war until 1947 when she was placed in reserve. Despite numerous ideas to modernise her it was considered too expensive and she would be broken up in 1962.
