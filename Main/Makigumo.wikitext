== Character ==
=== Appearance ===
* Makigumo wears the standard Yuugumo-class school uniform which consists of a purple sleeveless dress over an oversized white shirt, a teal-blue bowtie and grey opaque pantyhose with lace-up boots and glasses. She wears her rigging on her back as a backpack with a single black strap strap. Quadruple torpedo launchers are strapped to her thighs and unique to Makigumo is a specially modified 12.7cm Twin Gun for her to handle due to her oversized sleeves blocking her fingers and a little bunny, similar to Sazanami's bunny, hanging on to her rigging's AA gun (relationship to Sazanami or Uzuki is unknown).

==Notes==
*Can equip [[:Category:Extra Armor (Medium)|Extra Armor (Medium)]] and [[:Category:Landing_Craft|Landing Craft]] in her Kai Ni form.

==Trivia==
*Her name means "cirrus cloud".
*On 1 February of 1943 while she was evacuating troops from Guadalcanal she struck a mine while was trying to avoid an attack of PT-Boats. 
**[[Yuugumo]] rescued the survivors and then scuttled her.
*Her resting remains are around [http://ict.sopac.org/VirLib/TR0280.pdf 20 m] below the sea surface, near to Cape Esperance, 4.8 km south-southwest of Savo Island.
