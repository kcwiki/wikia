==Map Guide==
*This is a '''single fleet''' map.
*The map is split into 2.5 parts:
**Phase 1 requires defeating the {{ShipLink|Abyssal Mediterranean Princess|text=Abyssal Mediterranean Princess}} at {{Event/Route|J|Red}}.
**Phase 1.5 requires unlocking the TP Phase nodes.
**Phase 2 requires carrying out a Transport Operation towards Node {{Event/Route|O|Red}}.
*The time spent on Phase 2 heavily depends on how much Transport Load-Off Equipment you can bring to the boss node {{Event/Route|O|Red}}. The [[Events/Mechanics|Mechanics Tab]] has a list of TP Load-Off Equipment and how many points it deducts from the TP Gauge.

===Phase 1: Defeat the Abyssal Mediterranean Princess===
This phase is very straightforward. Defeat the princess and deplete the HP Gauge. Apart from her the only other noteworthy threat in the boss fleet is the Nu-Class Kai Flagship Light Carrier that can appear in some compositions. The Princess herself can be a tough opponent on Hard Mode because she has 740 HP and up to 228 Armour. One to three historical ships are recommended to deal with her.

'''1FBB 1CA 1CL 1 CV(L) 2DD (Fast Fleet)'''
*Route: {{Event/Route|C|red|F|blue|H|red|J|red}}
*LBAS: Range 6, 101/225 Airpower required for AP/AS
*Vanguard Formation recommended for pre-boss nodes.
*Support Expeditions are not required.

===Phase 1.5: Unlock the transport route===
On Hard Mode you have to score at least an A-Rank at Node {{Event/Route|D|red}}, which is the home of up to three {{ShipLink|Supple Depot Princess|text=Supply Depot Princesses}}, one or two {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp|text=Artillery Imps}}, and two {{ShipLink|PT Imp Pack|text=PT Imp Packs}}. Refer to [[Combat/Installation|this page]] on how to deal with them. PT Imp Packs are weak against DDs with AA Guns + Skilled Lookouts.

'''1FBB 1 CA 1CL 1 CVL 2DD (Slow Fleet)'''
*Route: {{Event/Route|B|red|D|red}}
*LBAS: Range 3, 136 Airpower required for AP
*Support Expeditions are not required but can help you deal with the PT Imp Packs.

===Phase 2: Deplete the TP Gauge===
This phase's boss fleet consists of a {{ShipLink|French Battleship Princess|text=French Battleship Princess}}, a weaker version of the {{ShipLink|Abyssal Mediterranean Princess|text=Abyssal Mediterranean Princess}}, and a few Late Model destroyers

'''1FBB 1CV(L) 4DD'''
*Route: {{Event/Route|C|red|F|blue|G|red|N|green|O|red}} 
*LBAS: Range 7, 101 Airpower required for AS (108 during LD)
*Aiming for S-Ranks may not be viable without support expeditions due to boss's high Armour values.
