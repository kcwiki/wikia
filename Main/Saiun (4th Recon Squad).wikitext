|en = "No enemy fighter can catch us." The Saiun was a high-performance carrier-based reconnaissance plane - the high speed of its brilliant design ensured no enemy fighter could keep pace with it. 
The Saiun flew over the sea reconnoitering enemy movements as the war situation turned grim. The 4th Reconnaissance Squadron, equipped with these very planes, scouted out Leyte during Operation Sho I; afterward, they continued to play an important role as eyes for the 343rd Naval Air Group, who mainly flew the Shiden Kai.

A part of the [[Shiden Kai (343 Air Group) 301st Fighter Squadron|343rd Naval Air Group]], Genda personally believed that the devastating defeat at the Battle of Midway was due to faulty reconnaissance, so he decided to incorporate the new Saiun to his air group. A unique feature to the air group, a squadron solely dedicated to recon was uncommon because most recon was done by dive or torpedo bombers like the IJN and USN were doing before or seaplanes which were much slower and prone to shooting down, so he developed special strategies specifically for the Saiun pilots to shadow air battles, ground and sea movements and scout ahead before the Shidens took flight. Every sortie had to be accompanied by a recon squad to ensure maximum efficiency, so serious effort was put into massively improving radio and wireless communications, ground operators and facilities to process and analyze incoming information thanks in part to Genda's influence and aid from the Naval Air Arsenal. The leader of the 4th Reconnaissance Squadron was Toshio Hashimoto who was previously a skilled torpedo bomber pilot who helped sink USS Yorktown at the Battle of Midway under the command of [[Type 97 Torpedo Bomber (Tomonaga Squadron)|Joichi Tomonaga]].
* The squadron was also known as the ''Kihei-tai'' (奇兵隊 ''Commando corps'').
* This version of the Saiun has a considerably shorter range in comparison to [[Saiun (Eastern Caroline Air Group)|East Caroline Air Group]] or the [[Saiun|standard version]]. This most likely represents the problems the squadron had with low quality components and engine oil; and fuel with low octane numbers that undermined the performance of the engine.
