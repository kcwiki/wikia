== Character ==
===Appearance===
* She has yellow eyes and long purple hair with an ahoge. Her hair is tied into a side ponytail similar to Kaga's, continuing a Kantai Collection trend of matching a few traits from escort ships to the ships they escorted. (Other commentators note a distinct likeness to Shimamura Uzuki of <em>iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls</em>.)
* Hagikaze wears clothing similar to other Kagerou-class destroyers, including a white blouse with a black vest, and a red neck ribbon. She also wears a black pleated skirt, white gloves, black thigh-highs, and loafers. Uncommonly for a destroyer, her breasts are more prominent and she can be seen to wear a purple bra when damaged.
* Her combat gear includes a twin-cannon turret held with two handles on the sides and a purse-like strap, with a backpack-like mount for a smokestack that carries swing-arms for more turrets. On her thighs, she has additional anti-air guns strapped in garter belt-like arrangements.
=== Personality ===
* Hagikaze has a cheerful, eager, but feminine personality. 
* She notably has an aversion to the night, especially night battles. Probably due to her historical sinking in a disastrous night ambush.
* She likes cooking healthy and nutritious dishes, as seen in her hourly and seasonal lines.

==Notes==
*[[Fall 2015 Event]] E-5 Clear Reward.

==Trivia==
*Her name, while literally reading as "Clover Wind", is more usually translated as "Wind Before The Horn Clover Blooms". 
*Hagikaze was the destroyer ordered to scuttle the heavily damaged aircraft carrier Kaga during the Battle of Midway, due to her role as her guard destroyer during the battle. She also recovered some of [[Kaga|Kaga's]] survivors, along with [[Maikaze]].
*She was sent as part of a supply convoy alongside Shigure, Kawakaze and Arashi to deliver supplies to Kolombangara Island. In what would later be known as the Battle of Vella Gulf, the 4 destroyers would be ambushed by destroyers of USN Task Group 31.2 in complete darkness, resulting in the sinking of Hagikaze, Arashi and Kawakaze, with Shigure being the only survivor when the torpedo that hit her did not explode.
