===[[Suzuya Kai Ni]]===
{{SeasonalGallery|slideshow=true|Suzuya/Kai Ni|Suzuya/Carrier Kai Ni}}
There are two forms: ''[[CAV|Aviation Cruiser]] (Kai Ni)'' and ''[[CVL|Light Carrier]] (Carrier Kai Ni)''
*{{ShipLink|Suzuya/Kai Ni}}
**Requires level 84+
*** Requires a [[blueprint]]
*** No Stock Equipment
*{{ShipLink|Suzuya/Carrier Kai Ni}}
**Requires level 88+
***Converted from Suzuya Kai Ni
***Requires another [[blueprint]]
***No Stock Equipment
***'''Additional Info & Mechanics'''
****Officially known as ''"Fast Light Attack Carrier"''
****Her ship type is CVL, but with the following peculiarities:
*****When there are '''no''' surface ships (Ex. DD/CL/CA/BB/CV(L)) present in the enemy fleet she '''will''' attack submarines just like a regular CVL.
*****When there '''are''' surface ships present in the enemy fleet along with a Submarine she '''will''' attack surface targets like a standard CV.
*****(Ex. An enemy surface fleet escorted by a submarine is presented. Suzuya CVL will ignore the SS and attack the surface ships; however, if all surface ships are sunk, then she will attack the submarine.)
****She is the first and currently the only Medium-ranged CVL in the game.
*'''Important Notice'''
**Suzuya Kai Ni to Suzuya Carrier Kai Ni '''requires''' a Blueprint no matter what.
***This means that if you had reverted her back into a CAV, it will cost you another blueprint if you try to remodel her back to a CVL again afterward.
***Remodeling Suzuya Carrier Kai Ni back into Suzuya Kai Ni (CAV) '''does not''' consume a Blueprint.

! '''Analysis'''
|-
|
*Now has 76 {{Firepower}} and 88 {{Torpedo}}
*Her {{Firepower}} barely changes, but she gains a huge stat boost in {{Torpedo}} that increases her Night Battle power to 164. Still inferior to Myoukou-class based on raw stats, but one of the best when compared to CAVs. Slightly better than Tone-class.
*Plane slot distribution: 3,3,7,11
*7 and 11 are decent distribution for planes.
*Priority in obtaining her isn't highest due to the steep K2 level and blueprint requirement with no profitable stock equipment.
|-
!'''Analysis'''
|-
|
* 56 {{Firepower}} stats for a CVL
* This equals to 139 base damage with carrier shelling formula; highest {{Firepower}} of all the CVLs.
* Has 61 {{HP}} and 74 {{Armor}}
* This makes her the tankiest CVL in the game; in addition, she has high evasion on par with {{ShipLink|Junyou}}
*Has a poor slot distribution of 15, 12, 12, 8.
*Since she requires another [[blueprint]] to convert, this makes it a difficult choice as obtaining her CVL form will cost you two blueprints on top of the high K2 level. Consider these before planning on pursuing her.
*Has the highest raw stats among the CVLs to date, which also rivals some of the CV. However, she has terrible plane slot distribution in return.
