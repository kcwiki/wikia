==Character==

===Appearance===
* The flower on her head is the wild spring chrysanthemum (都忘れ; ''miyakowasure''), which in the flower language means 'the sadness of parting,' 'a short moratorium,' & 'until the day we meet again'.
** This kind of chrysanthemum is rather unique, as the other subgenus of it tend to hold more positive meanings, such as 'love' and 'happiness'.
**  The chrysanthemum is well-celebrated in Japan, while also being the symbol of the Emperor and the Emperor's family.

{{clear}}

===Personality===
* For many, Akebono is an odd ship. She's very verbally abusive, and unlike [[Michishio]] or [[Kasumi]] who have gentler sides in contrast to their harsh tongues, Akebono never really seems to be appreciative of the admiral's (your) actions. However, her history seems to be a basis for this.
** To begin with, Akebono doesn't stand out favorably in history. Unlike her sister-ship [[Ushio]] who is considered as the 'ship of fortune,' Akebono is taken as the 'ship of misfortune'. Look below for more details.

{| class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed wikitable"
|-
! colspan="1" |The details
|-
|1. ''Battle of the Coral Seas''<br />
Akebono was assigned to escort Zuikaku while Ushio was assigned to Shoukaku. In the middle of the mission, Ushio requested to switch with Akebono, to which Akebono agreed. However, American bombers heavily damaged Shoukaku, yet Zuikaku got away without a single scratch. As a result, Ushio & Zuikaku were considered the lucky ships from this point on while Akebono & Shoukaku received the opposite. Similarly, rather than reprimanding Ushio, Akebono was reprimanded and blamed for Shoukaku's injuries. Akebono was then reassigned from the front lines to the rear.

This is reflected in [[#Quotes|Secretary(3)]] ''If you don't like me, why don't you just reassign me?''.


2. January 1944 Escort<br />
Akebono & her sister Sazanami were escorting a fleet of supply ships. En route, Sazanami was attacked by USS Albacore (SS-218) & sank on the spot. Akebono launched 59 depth charges & successfullydrove it away. However, the delayed rendezvous with the supply fleet left it with no protection. As such, it was virtually annihilated.

This is reflected in her [[#Quotes|Library Intro]], ''....But, I'm a bit uneasy around subs....'', as she not only lost her sister to them, but failed as an escort.


3. ''Battle of Leyte Gulf''/''Battle of Surigao Strait''<br />
Akebono was once again assigned with Ushio. When Mogami collided into Nachi, causing the former to begin sinking, Akebono went to escort Mogami. However, the American air wings did not let up & further damaged the half-sunken Mogami. In the end, Akebono was ordered to scuttle Mogami with a torpedo.


4. Manila Air Raids<br />
The Americans were determined to finish off Nachi, who had just received damage from crashing into Mogami at Surigao Strait. At that time, Akebono was ported with Nachi and was the only ship able to immediately defend Nachi. Unfortunately, as much as Akebono attempted to fend off the innumerable number of aircraft, Nachi sustained several heavy hits & sank.

Naturally, Akebono was heavily damaged as well & Ushio towed her into the dock for repairs. However a week later, the Americans launched another air strike. Akebono was critically hit, with her cannons, engines, and torpedoes all but destroyed. She sank (upright in shallow waters) while being observed by Ushio nearby.


Closing notes<br />
If Akebono & Ushio hadn't switched back in the Coral Seas, her fate may have been different. However Akebono doesn't blame Ushio for all of this - she is much more upset at her superiors who blamed her inappropriately while overlooking the circumstances at the time. That's why she insists on calling the admiral 'Kuso Teitoku' - she has a profound distrust of her superiors. [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Akebono/@comment-115.78.207.125-20150123091301?permalink=163472#comm-163472 Cr Evan Y. Liu]

===Media===
* In the Light Novel [[Merchandise/Light Novels|Kagerou, Setting Sail!:]]
{| class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed wikitable"
|-
! colspan="1" |Spoilers
|-
|
Her personality is formed by PTSD due to the failure to protect transport ships in her first expedition as a fleet girl, together with Ushio, from an Abyssal attack, along with accompanying memories succeeded from the warship Akebono.

Despite her problematic character, Akebono is noted to be a talented and highly skilled fleet girl. When DesDiv 14 was formed, she was of the more combatworthy trio (which also included Kagerou and Arare) and displayed high proficiency in all areas.

==Trivia==
* ''Akebono'' means ''daybreak''.
** Her name was first carried by the fourth ship of the Ikazuchi class in 1898. The Ikazuchi class were the first Torpedo Boat Destroyers of Japan.
** Inherited twice in the newer JMSDF, the most recent by the newer DD-108, a Murasame-class destroyer, along with the newer Ikazuchi and Inazuma.
* Sunk by an air raid on November 14th, 1944 at [[wikipedia:Manila_Bay|Manila Bay, Philippines]] ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Akebono&params=14_35_N_120_55_E_ 14°35′N 120°55′E]). The wreckage was cleared 11 years later, [[Kiso|along]] [[Satsuki|with]] [[Hatsuharu|6]] [[Akishimo|oth]][[Okinami|er]] [[Nachi|ships]].
