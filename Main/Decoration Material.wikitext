Early estimations for drop rates (average for different equipment setups):
*1-4 Boss S Rank: ~50% for decoration materials, ~3-6% for present boxes (~1000 trials)
**Searchlight + Skilled Lookouts = 4-5: 40-53% (95% CI)
**Searchlight + Skilled Lookouts = 8-9: 57-74% (95% CI)
*1-5 Boss S Rank: < 50% (low sample size)
*2-5 Boss S Rank: ~75% for decoration materials (~500 trials), ~10% for present boxes (~400 trials)
*3-5 Hoppo S Rank: > 50%, Boss S Rank: < 50% (low sample size)

==Exchange==
The decoration materials can only be exchanged for 30 fuel each. Bottom left option is to exchange one decoration material for 30 fuel, bottom right option is to go back, choosing the option on the right will result in exchanging ALL materials for fuel.

==Decoration Material Quests==
2 quests were added along with the event. Note that the quests counts the number of decoration materials you have in your current inventory, so it is recommended to keep them until all the quests below are completed, especially since their individual exchange value is low. You do not have to keep the quest active in order to obtain the Decoration Materials from the applicable maps, selecting it with enough decoration materials in your inventory will complete the quest.
