== Character ==
===Appearance===
* She has red eyes and brown hair which is curled into twin drills and adorned with a red bow. She wears a Meiji schoolgirl uniform (reflecting the fact that she and her sisters were built during the Taisho era, when this style of dress was still prominent) that consists of a pink kimono, a red hakama with cherry blossom petals on it, and cross-laced high heel boots. She also carries a red oriental umbrella and has an anchor ornament on her hakama.
=== Personality ===
* Harukaze speaks in a sweet, polite way, and is voiced by Mamiko Noto.
==Trivia==
*After being incapacitated in an air attack and lacking resources to repair her, she was towed to Hyōgo Prefecture on the Sea of Japan, 1947 and finally scuttled to form part of the breakwater at Takeno Port.
** Her hulk was damaged by a typhoon just some months after it was put in place as breakwater and was [http://www.pref.kyoto.jp/suiji/1167107511317.html subsequently broken up.] <sup>[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Harukaze/@comment-Hyper_Shinchan-20160514075200?permalink=437524#comm-437524 [1]]</sup>
*In October 1944 Harukaze led what was to be known as the "Tragedy of the MaTa30 Convoy". MaTa30 Convoy 「マタ３０船団」was a convoy of transport ships escorted from Manila, Phillipines to Takao (now known as Kaohsiung), Taiwan. America had just begun their campaign in the Philippines and to escape from the air raids, a total of 12 transport ships containing various things from supplies, POW's and civilians was ordered to head towards Takao. The convoy was also known as the "Harukaze convoy" due to Harukaze being the flagship of the operation. However, the convoy was ambushed by US submarines which led to the sinking of 9 out of the 12 transport ships including the ship Arisan Maru carrying about 1800 POWs. After the war Japan was prosecuted for leaving most of the POWs to die.
*Harukaze is believed to have been the cause of USS Shark's (SS-314) sinking and disappearance since it became missing after October 24, 1944. After the war records from Japan stated that Shark had been sunk by Harukaze, this was not written in the book created by the ex-crew members of Harukaze as the shock of the tragedy of the MaTa30 Convoy was probably too big.
*During her introduction in the Spring 2016 event Harukaze was subject to a bug that gradually increased her firepower, torpedo, AA and armor stat maximums as she leveled allowing her, at high level, to outclass other destroyers until hotfixed on 5/13/2016.
