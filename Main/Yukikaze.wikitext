==Character==

=== Appearance ===
*Yukikaze has brown-ish yellow eyes, and short brown hair. On her head is a fire director, on both sides are one half of a Type 22 surface radar, while on the right cheek is a microphone-ish speaker tube.
* Yukikaze wears a yellow scarf, a very short slightly see-through white buttoned sailor dress with blue stripes on her cuffs and end of her dress. She only wears white panties under her dress, which are printed with the words [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/579808948045266944 ユキカゼ], and wears rudder high heels.
* Yukikaze carries a quadruple torpedo launcher on a mount secured by two shoulder straps on her back, a 12.7cm twin gun mount with a pouch-like cover at the back, secured by a shoulder strap on her left shoulder. She also carries a large binoculars with a neck strap.

=== Personality ===
* She often boasts herself as the "unsinkable ship" in her lines.
* She's shown to be a cheerful and docile kanmusu .

==Trivia==
*Although she was known for being a lucky ship, various crews aboard other ships throughout the war viewed her as a bad omen, due to the fact that she escorted Shinano and later  [[Yamato]] (both ended up sinking)
*One of the survivors of World War II, along with [[Hibiki]].
**She was transferred to the Republic of China after World War II, renamed to Dan Yang/Tan Yang (丹陽), and served as the flagship of the [[wikipedia:Republic of China Navy|Republic of China Navy]]. The name "丹陽" refers to a county under Jiangsu province in Mainland China.
**She was scrapped in 1970 after being capsized in a storm that left her beyond repair. Sadly, a campaign to have her returned to Japan as a static museum ship failed, though an anchor and rudder were sent back.
*Her name means "Snowy Wind".
*Her name was passed down to the Harukaze-class destroyer JDS Yukikaze (DD-102) in the JMSDF. Destroyers [[Harukaze]] (''Kamikaze-''class) and Yukikaze were a remarkable success in the war and survived, so they were honored by having their names carried down to the first postwar Japanese destroyers.
*Her battle start quote 「雪風は沈みませんっ！」 "Yukikaze will not sink!" is originally a quote of Masamichi Terauchi as her 5th Captain. He took command from September 1943 to May 1945 and was the former captain of [[Inazuma]]. He always told his crew 「諸君、雪風は沈まん！なぜならばワシが艦長だからだ」 "Everyone, Yukikaze will not sink! Because I'm your captain!" After the war, historian Kazutoshi Hando asked him in presence of other (former) captains of the Yukikaze: "Why did Yukikaze never sink?" He said, laughing: "Why? BECAUSE I WAS HER CAPTAIN!"
