* Joichi Tomonaga led the one-way trip counterattack from [[Hiryuu]] to attack USS Yorktown on his damaged, low fuel plane. Although Tomonaga successfully dropped his torpedo, it missed shortly after being shot down by an [[F4F-4]]. His squadron heavily damaged and disabled Yorktown shortly after. The Tenzan Model 12 was supposed to replace his aging [[Type 97 Torpedo Bomber]].
