==Character==

===Appearance===
* Souryuu and [[Hiryuu]], being originally designed as sister ships, share many similarities. Namely, they wear color-differentiated versions of the same clothes.
**Souryuu wears a green dougi ("道着") top, with the bottom of the sleeves fading to gray (the main color, green and blue, are said to be coming from her name "蒼龍" which means "Blue Dragon" literally; in classic Japanese the phrase " 蒼 " signified both blue and green). Her bottom is a green pleated skirt. She also wears a flight deck apron like Akagi and Kaga. Her full flight deck is attached to her right arm. Unlike most other archer carriers, she doesn't wear muneate (chest armor).

* She has medium-length blue hair in twintails.
* Her considerable curves are often exaggerated (even compare to other -Ryu class carriers and Kaga-class ones) in fanart due to the line about Type 99s having such an interpretation.

=== '''Personality''' ===
* She is generally shown to be a nice, concerned soft-spoken girl.
* She, along with Hiryuu and Unryuu, have been nicknamed the "fluffy dragons" because of their generally soft and womanly appearance.

==Trivia==
*She was Japan's first purpose built Fleet Carrier.
*At speed of 34.5 knots, she was the fastest carrier in the world, along with Hiryuu.
*Sunk by dive bombers from USS Yorktown at the <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:11.333333015441895px;line-height:17.27083396911621px;"> </span>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway Battle of Midway] June 4 1942.
*Her moderate/heavily damaged CG is based on her historical damage condition after being attacked in the Battle of Midway, just like everyone else in the 1st and 2nd Carrier Division. As in the proximity of three elevators were hit by one bomb each.
*Successors to her name exist in the form of the [[wikipedia:S%C5%8Dry%C5%AB-class_submarine|Sōryū-class submarines]] (naming convention by the JMSDF).
*Received her Kai Ni on 18/07/2014.
