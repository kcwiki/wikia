|Library/En = I'm the 3rd ship of the Etorofu-class costal defense ships, Sado. I did my very best to stop submarines from dominating the seas as part of the 1st Surface Escort Division. I worked alongside [[Matsuwa]], [[Hiburi]] and [[Kasuga Maru#Upgrade|Taiyou-san]] too, but protecting the 1st Fleet was really difficult. I'll protect them properly this time. Nice to meet you!
