==Introduction==
[[File:Abyssal Combined.jpg|right|thumb|220x220px|An abyssal combined fleet]]The '''Abyssal Combined Fleet''' was first introduced in Map 6-5 after the 5th October 2016 update. Instead of facing a regular 6 Abyssal ship formation, player fleets encountered 12 Abyssal ships in a Combined Fleet formation at the boss node.
Starting from Fall 2016 Event, it is possible to engage an Abyssal Combined Fleet in a Combined Fleet maps in a 12 versus 12 battle.
