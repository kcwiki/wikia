==Character==
===Appearance===
The [[:Category:Chitose Class|Chitose class]] has 5 remodels with a total of 5 different visual forms, the most of any ship.
*General Apperance:
**Chitose has grey eyes and long silver/grey hair in a Asymmetric cut tied into a low ponytail with a white ribbon. (hidden behind her back in all but her Carrier Kai Ni Damaged CG).
**Chitose wears a white collared blouse with a red han-eri collar underneath as well as a navy blue blazer with a golden crane pattern embroidered into both sides. Her blouse is tucked into a short red hakama skirt with grey line and circle pattens on the ties. She wears a black pantyhose on her legs and a pair of brown Loafer shoes. She also wears a headband on her head with a forehead protector attached and a golden chinese good luck knot with 4 tassel cords as a neck accesory.
*1st Form: She dual-wields plane catapults as well as a pair of 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns and two tripple barrel Type 96 25mm Guns''' '''attached to her rigging.
*2nd Form (Kai): Chitose gains a second pair of plane catapults over her shoulders.
*3rd Form (A): She gains a pair of midget submarine racks on her ankles.
*4th Form (Carrier & Carrier Kai): Chitose replaces her catapults and submarine racks with a flight deck theater. On the flight deck is the first two kana of her name (ちと). She controls her planes with puppet control bars.
*5th Form (Kai 2): Her flight deck theatre becomes more intricate in its design and her hakama and vest gain splotches of a green, black, and yellow camo pattern. Her expression also changes from a more serious, commanding expression to a softer smile. Her damaged art also reveals a significant increase in bust size and that she wears white panties.

===Personality===
*She is known to be fond of alcohol, often spending time imbibing sake with [https://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Junyou Junyou]. She offers the Admiral a drink on occasion as well.

*Quite proud of her seaplanes and flightdeck.
*She cares a lot about [https://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Chiyoda Chiyoda], but is oblivious of Chiyoda's feelings towards her.
*Has a calm, mellow and easy-going personality.

==Note==
* Chitose (and her sister [[Chiyoda]]) can remodel five times and convert into a light aircraft carrier at level 15. You can keep her as a [[EliteAV|seaplane tender]] (AV) and choose not to remodel her into a [[EliteCVL|light aircraft carrier]] as AV maintenance cost is low and Chitose A will launch an attack during the opening torpedo phase when equipped with a [[Kouhyouteki]] which comes for free with her level 12 remodel.

==Trivia==
*Her name translates to "Millenium" or "Thousand Years"
**Chitose was named after the Chikugo River (also known as the Chitose River).
*The camo pattern of her 5th upgraded version clothes refer to the actual flight deck camouflage pattern used during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf Leyte Gulf] battle, the same pattern was used on [https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Zuikaku Zuikaku], [https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Chiyoda Chiyoda] and [https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Zuihou Zuihou].
*Received her Kai Ni on 24/07/2013, together with her sister.
*The real Chitose was unable to carry [[Kouhyouteki|Type A Midget Submarines]] (It was only speculated that she did, only  Chiyoda was confirmed to do so).
* Sunk in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf Battle of Leyte Gulf] on 25 October, 1944.
* Chitose is the name of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitose,_Hokkaido City], a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitose_Air_Base military airbase] and a civilian airport. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chitose_Airport New Chitose Airport] serves Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, North Japan.
** Her name was first carried by the second of the two ship [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasagi-class_cruiser Kasagi-class] protected cruisers in 1898.
** In her modern incarnation, she is one of eleven [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikugo-class_destroyer_escort Chikugo-class destoyer escorts] under the JMSDF as DE-220 Chitose.
* [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Memorial_stele_for_Japanese_Aircraft_Carrier_%22Chitose%22_in_Suiten_Shrine.jpg A memorial Stele for Chitose] is located at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurume_Suiteng%C5%AB Kurume Suitengu Shrine] , a Shinto shrine located in the city of Kurume in the Fukuoka prefecture on Kyuushuu, Japan. The text on the memorial is below.
**いつよりの千歳かわかぬ千歳川　始もはても　なき名なりけり

昭和十三年就役以来　日支事変、太平洋戦争と幾多の戦闘海戦に出撃　赫々たる戦果を挙げた軍艦千歳は、フィリピン沖海戦に於て勇戦奮闘するも衆寡敵せず　遂にフィリピンエンガノ岬東方に艦長以下数百の将兵と共にその勇姿を没した

時に昭和十九年十月二十五日午前九時三十七分

軍艦千歳は筑後川（別名千歳川）の名を取って命名されたものであり　艦内神社に水天宮を奉祀してありました
