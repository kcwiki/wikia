==Trivia==
*Launched March 24th 1928.
*Played a prominant part in the early battles of WW2 near Java, taking part in the sinkings of destroyers ''HMS Encounter'' and ''HNLMS Kortenaer'', the light cruiser ''HNLMS [[De Ruyter]]'' and heavy cruiser ''HMS Exeter''.
*She continued to play an active part in the war, albeit often as AA escort, taking part in the battles of the Coral Sea, Eastern Solomans, Guadalcanal evacuations, the action at Emperess Augusta Bay (and subsequent air attacks), Battle of Phillipine Sea and Leyte Gulf.
*Sunk in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca Strait of Malacca] by gunfire and torpedoes, May 16, 1945, in a battle with British destroyers. She was the last major ship of the war, and one of the last of time, to be sunk in a traditional gunboat battle.
** Wreck discovered on March 4th, 2003, in 213 ft. (65 m) of water. Sadly, like [[Kuma]] and most other nearby wrecks, became a victim of [http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/05/22/Wrecks-fished-for-scrap-metal-Thieves-plunder-fishing-grounds-for-rusty-ship-parts/ illegal salvage activity] in 2014 and has mostly disappeared.
*Her name has been resurrected as JS Haguro DDG-180, launched on 17th July 2019 under the JMSDF, a sister ship to the modern Maya-class Aegis cruisers.
*Her second remodel boasts formidable stats, in which her firepower is probably a reference to her reputation during the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_the_Java_Sea#Battle|Battle of the Java Sea]], where she sank the combined American, British, Dutch and Australian fleet's flagship, the Dutch light cruiser ''HNLMS De Ruyter'' with a single torpedo, and another single torpedo kill on the destroyer ''Kortenaer''. Her evasion stat likely stems from her survival until 16th May 1945 when she and ''[[Kamikaze]]'' were ambushed by 26th Destroyer Flotilla from Royal Navy Force 61 during Operation Dukedom.
*Operation Dukedom was arranged specifically to hunt ''Haguro'' as she and ''[[Ashigara]]'' were the only significant naval forces left defending Singapore (''[[Myoukou]]'' and ''[[Takao]]'' were also present but unseaworthy).
* Received her Kai Ni on 23/05/2014, together with ''[[Ryuujou]]''.
* Named after Mt. Haguro in Yamagata prefecture.
