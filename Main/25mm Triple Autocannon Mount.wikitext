An improved version of a domestically produced, anti-aircraft autocannon.<br/>It is a triple barrel version of the 25 mm high-angle autocannon, but it does not fire them all at once and instead, it fires them one at a time to prevent the barrel from overheating.<br/>Supplementing the conventional twin autocannon and provisional single autocannons, this 25 mm triple autocannon became the mainstay of close range anti-aircraft armaments.
