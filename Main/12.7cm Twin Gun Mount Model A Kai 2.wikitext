|en = An improved version of the main gun turret designed specifically for the Special Type Destroyers. A predecessor to the modern destroyer gun turrets, this model implements power-mounting, allowing for higher accuracy and training speeds. In addition, full enclosure provides protection from weather as well as shrapnel and bullets. It cannot, however, be used for anti-aircraft purposes due to it's low maximum elevation.
