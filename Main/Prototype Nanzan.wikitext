The "Seiran", a high-performance carrier based dive bomber, developed as a strategic operations seaplane that could be carried by submarines. The "Nanzan" is the land based version and an arresting hook was added to this prototype carrier based bomber version. Since it is a test machine, it has an ostentatious paint scheme.
