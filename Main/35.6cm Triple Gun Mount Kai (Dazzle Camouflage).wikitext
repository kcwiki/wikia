|en = This is a hypothetical Kai Ni triple gun mount of the 35.6 cm naval guns, planned as an brand new alternative armament for the Kongou-class fast battleships. It has improved accuracy, although the effectiveness is unclear. The final specification of the zebra-pattern dazzle camouflage on Haruna's fore turrets, with which she fought to the end at Kure, has also been applied.
