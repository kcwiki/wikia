*Torpedo cruisers have the highest torpedo stat among light cruisers which makes them terrifically deadly night combatants.
*Light cruiser [[Kiso]] remodels into a torpedo cruiser with her second remodel at level 65.
*Kitakami and Ooi have a very low first remodel level (at level 10). They can be used as an easy source of [[61cm Quadruple (Oxygen) Torpedo Mount]]s.
*All torpedo cruisers at their second remodel have a valuable [[61cm Quintuple (Oxygen) Torpedo Mount]] as their default equipment.
