==Map Guide==
*You cannot bring carrier of any kind to this map.
*Node F and L are Submarine nodes.
*Node I, J, and K consists of Surface Ships (DD/CL(T)/CA).
*The Boss is {{ShipLink|Submarine Princess}}. It is recommended that you bring OASW capable DD/CLs, especially {{ShipLink|Isuzu Kai Ni}} for Beginners.
**If you lack OASW capable ships, please bring as many DD/CLs as possible, equipped with [[List of Anti-Submarine Equipment by stats|SONARs and Depth Charge]], and bringing a BB(V) will be considered mandatory in this case to gain the 2nd Shelling Phase.
**As you're using a single fleet, the ASW damage will be capped to 1 when entering night battles which effectively turns every ASW attack into scratch damage. Remember that you '''cannot''' sink a ship with scratch damage, effectively making any enemy submarines invincible during a night battle.
*Please bring some [[List of Seaplanes by stats|Seaplanes]] and [[List of Radars by stats|Radars]] as you require them for eLoS check.
