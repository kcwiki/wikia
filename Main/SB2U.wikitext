* Was supposed to be introduced in the [[Fall 2016 Event]], but ended being cancelled.
* Its design is based on the only remaining SB2U displayed in the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida.
* By the beginning of World War 2 the aircraft was already obsolete. But nonetheless participated in the Battle of Midway with Marine Scout Bombing Squadron (VMSB) 241, and resulted in heavy losses.
** Captain [[wikipedia:Richard E. Fleming|Richard Eugene Fleming]] of VMSB-241, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for "extraordinary heroism and conspicuous intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty" for leading the remainder of his division after his Squadron Commander was shot down during the initial attack upon an enemy aircraft carrier on 4 June 1942. On 5 June, he managed to score a near-miss against a "battleship" before being shot down.
*** The said "battleship" was in reality the Japanese cruiser [[Mikuma]].
* For its performance in combat, Marine pilots called it the "Wind-Indicator."
