== Can the 2nd Flagship sink? ==

No, they will '''not''' sink (''confirmed as of [[Fall 2016 Event]]'').

== Which event-only ships can we get in this event? ==

:See the table below for previous event only specific drops.
{{Event Drop}}

<div style = "text-align:right">[[#top|back to top]]</div>

== Is there any [[Events/Mechanics#Ship_Locking|ship locking]]? ==
Yes for E1-E4 normal and hard. For E5 only hard receives ship-locking.<br>
You may wish to refer to [http://kancolle.doorblog.jp/archives/49296732.html this link (Japanese only)] - a tentative thread about how to get the best out of ship locking.

== Why can't I sortie to E-? HELP!!! ==

If you follow this simple 3 step pathway, you should be on your way to sortieing to E_
#'''Correct Map'''
#*'''​'''You'd be surprised
#'''Correct Fleet'''
#*Single Fleet for Single Fleet maps
#*Combined Fleet for Combined Fleet maps
#*Transport Escort fleet for Transport Escort fleet maps etc.
#*Also, on '''Medium/Hard difficulty''', you mustn't have any ships that have been '''ship locked''' to a different tag colour. See [[Events/Mechanics#Ship_Locking|here]] for a hopefully foolproof explanation
#'''Minimum Requirements'''
#*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio
#*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships
#*Must have 20 free equipment slots

== What is/are the drop rates for XXXXX, YYYYY, ZZZZZ ship? ==

Currently there are three sites with database on the drop rates. Information from those sites may not be neither complete nor accurate however they still form as part of the sources in terms of drops and drop verification apart from information sourced internally from the wiki itself:
* http://db.kcwiki.moe/drop/map/341/3/J-SAB.html
* http://kancolle-db.net
* https://myfleet.moe/entire/sta/drop_stage

For more information on how to navigate around these sites you may wish to refer to [[User_blog:Crazy_teitoku/Guide_to_navigating_around_drop_databases|this blog entry]].
