Although being a biplane, this is a dual-seat float reconnaissance plane with outstanding maneuverability and high air-to-air capability. Its initial purpose was for fleet's gunnery spotting and reconnaissance, however its high dogfight ability even outqualify purposely built float fighters. Being modern enough as well as being biplane, it's no doubt a masterpiece of its own class.

* Not to be confused with [[Type 0 Reconnaissance Seaplane]].
* '''Buildable''' as of the 14 March update.
* Development requires at least 10 [[File:Fuel.png|20px]], 10 [[File:Ammunition.png|20px]], 10 [[File:Steel.png|20px]], 20 [[File:Bauxite.png|20px]], with Fuel/Steel as primary resource for a drop rate of 2%. No reports exist of successful development with Ammo or Bauxite as primary resource.

Code named "Pete" by Allies, the Mitsubishi F1M had high air-to-air capability resulting from its crisp maneuverability (basically biplanes have better mobility than monoplanes while trading off high-speed capability) as highlighted in description text. It seldom served its original role of gunnery spotting, but with its high dynamics and stability it served many purposes such as ground attacks, anti-submarine patrols, convoy escort and sometimes air-to-air combat, having its maneuverability equal that of [[Type 96 Fighter|Type 96 fighters]] (which are purposely-built monoplanes).
* There are actually kill records of Americans fighters such as F4F's and even an F6F.
** On 16 February 1945, Warrant Officer [[wikipedia:Nobuo Fujita|Nobuo Fujita]] (藤田信雄海軍兵曹長), managed to shoot down an F6F onboard a Type 0 Observation Seaplane despite the technical disadvantage. Members of the Katori Air Group confirmed its wreckage.
*** In that flight WO Fujita was assisted by five more Type 0 Observation Seaplanes and two [[Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai|Type 2 Seaplane Fighters]] of which the majority were downed.
*** WO Fujita is also known for being the only man who succeeded in bombarding the contiguous United States in 1942, event known as the [[wikipedia:Lookout Air Raids|Lookout Air Raids]]. This was done onboard a Type 0 Small Reconnaissance Seaplane.
