|Introduction = 占守型海防艦、その二番艦、国後。<br>何それ？　違うけど？　そうね、クナって…<br>呼んでもらってもいいけど。
|Introduction/En =The second of Shimushu-class, Kunashiri. What's that? That's wrong. Right, you can call me Kuna. 
|Introduction/Note = 

|Library =占守型海防艦二番艦、国後よ。　北方の守りは任せてよね。　え、地味だろって。　何それ！　あの出撃の前の単冠湾の哨戒とか、大事な役割も務めたんだから。　大湊を起点に、千島列島や宗谷海峡、津軽海峡など大切な所を守ったの。　ねえ、聞いてる？最後は大切な大切なこと、頑張ったし。　ちょっと神風さんに迷惑かけちゃったけど。　頑張ったよね、あたし！ 
|Library/En =I am Kunashiri, the second ship of Shimushu-class Coastal Defense Ship. You can leave the defense of the north to me. What? That's simple you said? How could you! Before _that_ sortie, I played an important role, like patrolling Hitokappu Bay. Using Ominato as a starting point, I protected important places like Chishima Islands, Soya Strait, Tsugaru Straight and others. Hey, are you listening? In the end I worked very hard in a very, very important job. I inconvenienced Kamikaze a little, but I worked hard. 
|Library/Note =In 1946, while on a return repatriation voyage and en-route to Uraga, Kunashiri ran aground near Cape Omaezaki, Shizuoka when her crew mistook a fishing vessel's lights for the Omaezaki lighthouse. While attempting to rescue passengers and crew off of the stranded Kunashiri, Kamikaze also ran aground. Both were abandoned, after the passengers and crew were transferred over to another ship.

==Notes==
*As an Escort ship, Kunashiri has a reduced ASW score requirement for performing Opening Anti-Submarine attacks, needing only at least '''60''' ASW instead of the normal 100.
*If used in [[modernization]], Kunashiri will increase both a ship's ASW stat and Luck. If used in conjunction with a sister ship (i.e. [[Shimushu]]), both will also provide an increase in a ship's HP. 

==Trivia==
* Named after the island of Kunashir (known in Japanese as Kunashiri).
* Launched and commissioned in 1940 as part of the Maru-3 plan.
* On 8 January 1942, when Kunashiri entered Paramushir Base, she received a signal of "Why did you not salute to me" from destroyer Nenohi. Kunashiri replied with "I am Kunashiri". Kunashiri's captain was of higher rank than Nenohi's, so the captain of Nenohi went to Kunashiri in person to apologize.
** The incident came from the confusion about the Japanese ship category of "Kaiboukan". Originally this category was coined for obsolete large ships serving in coastal waters, but after the London Naval Treaty of 1930 limited the numbers of destroyers, the IJN was in dire need for ships small enough to be exempt from the treaty, but still capable of patrolling northern waters to tackle potential fishing disputes with the Soviet Union. The Shimushu-class was created to satisfy this demand, and despite being significantly smaller than destroyers, they were classified along with those large ships as Kaiboukans. Since the majority of the category were large combatant ships, the Kaiboukan, including the tiny Shimushu-class, was considered 軍艦 (lit. "Military ship"), a class of IJN ships only given to combatant ships the size of a cruiser or larger. A Military ship will receive a Chrysanthemum badge at the bow, while a non-military ship (e.g. a destroyer or submarine) will not. Kaiboukan's position as a military ship caused the 860-ton Shimushu-class to have a higher position (and given a higher-ranked commander) than the 1400-ton destroyer Nenohi, thereby causing the incident.
** Kaiboukans' military ship titles were later removed in July 1942, and the Chrysanthemum badges on the bows of the Shimushu-class ships were also removed. As a result, the 1943 Etorofu-class, under the new definition of Kaiboukan, never received either the badge or the title.
* Participated in Operation Ke-gou (retreat from Kiska, the historical counterpart of stage 3-2) in 1943, as part of the resupply fleet. She escorted the tanker Nippon-maru. On 26 July, she collided with Abukuma due to poor visibility, causing minor damage to both ships.
* Ran aground in 1946 on repatriation duties, unfortunately dooming [[Kamikaze]] who had diverted to help her and also ran aground.
