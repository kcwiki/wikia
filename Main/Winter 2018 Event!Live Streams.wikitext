|<br>''Streaming beyond February 18 until E7 Clear. '' <br> Most likely Easy-Normal Mode, but depending on reward, maybe Hard. Stream will be casual/interactive type. Let's make the last event of the 1st phase memorable! (With high levels of salt.)

|Its your tomodachi Serial here with the common, not rare at all, very very stupid mistakes frontline on all hard like I do every event, but every event that goes by I become less and less and even less confident in my skills. Regardless do try to say hello on my stream, if you so feel like it.

|Going against all odds and walls of salt in KC since 2015, and now powered up with the new gear. Friendly silent streams from Day 1 with bilingual English/Russian commentary, with the choice of map difficulty based on reward - but mostly Easy/Normal.
