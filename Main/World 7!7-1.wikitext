** Amount of ships in fleet = 5 '''OR''' Fleet contains AO.
** Amount of ships in fleet ≤ 5
** No (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B)
** No SS(V)

** Fleet contains (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B) '''AND''' no SS(V)
* If fleet contains '''SS(V)''':
** If amount of ships ≤ 4, random routing between B, D and F.
** If amount of ships ≥ 5, random routing between B and D.
** If fleet contains (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B), random routing between B and D.

** No (F)BB, CA or CV(B) (BBV and CAV are allowed)
** No SS(V)

*Go to I if fleet contains AO
* Meeting '''ANY''' of the following requirements routes you to K:
** Fleet contains DD '''AND''' amount of DE ≥ 3
** Amount of CL = 1 '''AND''' amount of DD ≥ 4
*Higher chance of going to K if the amount of ships in fleet = 5
*Otherwise, random routing (Small chance for node J)

===Notes===
*Clearing this map is required in order to open [[World 4/4-2|World 4-2]].
**To clear this map, the boss {{ShipLink|Submarine So-Class/Flagship}} must be sunk three times.
*This is an anti-submarine operation, where use of ships capable of using [[Partials/Opening ASW|opening ASW attacks]] (OASW) is highly recommended.
**Node {{Event/Route|G|red}} requires a surface battle against an enemy torpedo squadron.
**Use of Light/Torpedo Cruisers and Destroyers capable of using [[Partials/Opening ASW|opening ASW attacks]] either from being able to reach 100 {{ASW}} stat or having built-in OASW capabilities (''e.g''. {{ShipLink|Isuzu Kai Ni}}, [[Tatsuta Kai Ni]], {{ShipLink|Jervis/Kai}} and [[Samuel B. Roberts]]) is highly recommended.
**Use of [[List of coastal defense ships by upgraded maximum stats|Coastal Defense Ships]] is an option as well, but due to their poor firepower and defensive stats, they may have trouble surviving Node {{Event/Route|G|red}}.
*Using any BB, CV(L), AV or AO will cause fleets to be sent to Node {{Event/Route|B|red}}.
*Using 6 ships will cause fleets to route to Node {{Event/Route|B|red}}.
*Equipping a [[Drum Canister (Transport Use)]] will increase fuel gains by +2 Fuel per Drum on node E.

===Recommended Fleets===
====1 CL 4 DD ====
*'''This fleet has fixed routing towards the boss.'''
*Route {{Event/Route|D|red|E|green|G|red|H|red|K|red}}
*Use of a Light Cruiser capable of opening attacks against surface ships is an option for Node {{Event/Route|G|red}} .
**Opening torpedo attack ({{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}} or {{ShipLink|Yura Kai Ni}})
**Opening airstrike via {{Seaplane}} {{EquipmentLink|Zuiun|Prototype Seiran|text=Seaplane Bombers}} (''e.g.'' {{ShipLink|Agano|Noshiro|Yahagi|Sakawa|text=Remodeled Agano-class}})
***If neither are available, you may opt to use a Light Cruiser strong in surface combat, or a Light Cruiser capable of both surface combat and OASW together (''e.g.'' {{ShipLink|Isuzu/Kai Ni}} or {{ShipLink|Tatsuta/Kai Ni}})
*Bringing Destroyers capable of OASW is highly advised (100 {{ASW}} ASW stat or built-in capability).
**If ASW stat is high enough to reach OASW without three equipments, or if the ship has built-in OASW capability, mixing surface combat equipment and ASW equipment together can help stabilize the surface battle at Node G.
**For a low number of OASW-capable Destroyers, please make sure to still equip Destroyers with full synergy setups for ASW combat:
***'''Example 1''': Two '''(2)''' {{Sonar}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|Type 4 Passive Sonar|text=Sonar}} & One '''(1)''' {{DepthCharge}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|Type 94 Depth Charge Projector|text=Depth Charge Projector}}
***'''Example 2''': One '''(1)''' {{Sonar}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|Type 4 Passive Sonar|text=Sonar}} + One '''(1)''' {{DepthCharge}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Depth Charge Projector|Type 94 Depth Charge Projector|text=Depth Charge Projector}} + One '''(1)''' {{DepthCharge}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Depth Charge|Type 95 Depth Charge|text=Depth Charge}}.
*Speed is irrelevant here; i.e., {{ShipLink|Samuel B. Roberts|text=Samuel}} is allowed.

===Recommended Fleets with Chances to Dead End===
The following are fleets capable of reaching the Boss Node, however they have a chance to off-route into dead-end Nodes {{Event/Route|I|Green}} or {{Event/Route|J|Blue}}.
*{{Event/Route|F|red|G|red|H|red|K|red}}
**2 CLT 1 CL 1 DD
**2 CL 2 DD
**2 CL 2 CLT
**1 CAV 1 CLT 2 DD
**3 CLT 1 CL

==Sample Fleets==
{{Section|no_clear=true}}Please be advised the following are Samples, where you should try to optimize your fleet based on what is available in your Fleet. If lacking in appropriate Ships and/or Equipment, you are advised to go through further preparation to clear this Map.
