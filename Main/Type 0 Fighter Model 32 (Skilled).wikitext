This is the A6M Zero Model 32 carrier fighter used by skilled pilots. Its shortened wingspan from the Model 21 gave it some boost in performance, at the cost of cruising range and other factors. Nevertheless, in the hands of elite, skilled pilots, it supported the bloody battles above Rabaul and the Solomons.

The camouflage depicted is what is called "emergency camouflage", which was not standard-issued paint, but applied on the battlefield in immediate situations. Each painted plane had unique patterns due to them being hand painted by their pilots with no real direction. Once painted, it was hid in jungles and blended in nicely when flying over green vegetation.
