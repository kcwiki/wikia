|en = The cutting-edge carrier-based fighter Reppuu was developed as a successor to the famous Zero fighter. The original high-altitude interceptor Reppuu Kai was further developed and perfected for anti-fighter combat and carrier-based usage, its angled guns were removed, and its performance was improved to create the Reppuu Kai 2. This is a hypothetical elite fighter group operated by 1st Carrier Division. Allow the new wings of the CarDiv 1 into your kidou butai!
