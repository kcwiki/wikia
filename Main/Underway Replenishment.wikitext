'''Single-use consumable item.'''

'''Can be purchased off the cash [[shop]] with 300 DMM points for 2.'''

Stock equipment of [[Hayasui]] and [[Hayasui Kai]], can be equipped on [[Hayasui]] and [[Kamoi]] (in AO mode) in both their standard equipment slots and [[Reinforcement Expansion|expansion slot]].

Allows one to resupply the fleet's fuel and ammo during a sortie before entering the boss node (fuel and ammo are known to affect [[Accuracy_and_Evasion#Unconfirmed_Variables|evasion]] and [[Damage_Calculation#Remaining_Ammo_Modifier|damage]], respectively). Before entering the boss node you will be asked if the item(s) should be used (許可 or 却下, choosing 許可 will consume the item(s)).

For a normal/single fleet, it replenishes 25% (rounded down) of fuel and ammo of all ships, 50% when two items are used. For a combined fleet, it replenishes 15% of fuel and ammo of all ships (both main and escort fleets), 30% for two items.

The fuel and ammo used to resupply the ships will be detracted from the player's stockpile. Partial replenishment can occur when not having enough fuel/ammo, and with 0 fuel/ammo the choice for replenishment won't appear. Married ships won't receive the usual 15% reduction for fuel/ammo consumption.

This item can always be activated, regardless of the fleet position, morale, or health of the holder. The only exception is when she is retreated using the {{EquipmentLink|Fleet Command Facility}}; in these cases, you cannot activate the item.
