* This version of the French 380mm represents the upgraded turrets that have had their design flaws and poor accuracy fixed. This includes delay coils to prevent barrel vibrations, American shells that had properly functioning fuses, and more. However, the shell velocity dropped from 830 meters per second to 785-800 meters per second, and the max range decreased from 41.7 kilometers to 37.5 kilometers. This range reduction is reflected by the kai version's medium range attribute.
** It should be noted that 37.5 kilometers is still further than some other guns in-game that have long range, such as {{EquipmentLink|203mm/53 Twin Gun Mount|text=Zara's 203mm/53 Twin Gun Mount}}, {{EquipmentLink|38cm Twin Gun Mount|text=Bismarck's 38cm Twin Gun Mount}}, and {{EquipmentLink|38.1cm Mk.I Twin Gun Mount|text=Warspite's 38.1cm Mk.1 Twin Gun Mount}}.
* The French measured gun caliber in millimeters, so technically the name of this equipment should be "380mm Quadruple Gun Mount Kai".
