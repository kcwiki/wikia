==Trivia==
* Notable by the hydraulic lines sticking out, the bulldozer is based off the Komatsu G40 Bulldozer, which was Japan's first domestically produced bulldozer. It was used by the IJN to build their land bases and roads faster since at that point they were all built by manual labor.
* It was also used in the post-war reconstruction of Japan. There is only [http://oba-shima.mito-city.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/15_013.jpg one example] of the G40 still in existence, on display at Komatsu’s Techno Center in Japan.
