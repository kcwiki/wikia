== Character ==

=== Appearance ===

==Notes==
*Similar to [[Shoukaku]] and [[Zuikaku]], Kasumi has a base Kai Ni form and an alternate '''Kai Ni B''' form, the latter turning her into a dedicated anti-aircraft destroyer with better AA stats at the cost of weaker surface combat stats. Kasumi has the ability to freely switch between her two Kai Ni forms via remodelling, though her alternate form has to be unlocked by reaching the required remodel level, and she can only switch between Kai Ni and Kai Ni B.
*Kasumi Kai Ni B is capable of performing Anti-Air Cut-Ins without the use of an equipped Fire Director.
*Both of Kasumi's Kai Ni forms give her the ability to mount the [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]] making her the first destroyer in-game capable of doing so. Also able to equip [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]] and [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]].
**In her Kai Ni form she is capable of mounting [[Fleet Command Facility]].
**Her Kai Ni B form is the only destroyer capable of mounting [[:Category:Large_Radar|Large Radars]] normally reserved for larger ships like cruisers.
*Kasumi Kai Ni B is capable of performing two special types of Anti-Air Cut-In forms<ref>https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/689353451143168000</ref><ref>http://ja.kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/%E5%AF%BE%E7%A9%BA%E3%82%AB%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3</ref>
**The setup required is: <u>High-Angle mount</u> (any) {{GreenGunDP}}, plus <u>AA Gun</u> (any) {{GreenGunMG}}, plus [[:Category:Air_Radar|AA Radar]]{{Radar}}
***This is assigned the API value of 16. 4 shotdown.
**The second setup is: <u>High-Angle mount</u> (any) {{GreenGunDP}}, plus <u>AA Gun</u> (any) {{GreenGunMG}}. This allows her to perform double attacks at night in addition to AACI in the day if another gun is used at the cost of lower AACI power.
***This has an API value of 17. 2 shotdown.
*Both AACIs will overwrite all other AACIs in the game, including the stronger Akizuki and Maya AACIs, and are not recommended to be used in combination with them.

==Trivia==
*Participated in Operation Rei-go, the last victory for IJN in an organized battle in the Pacific War in some Japanese's mind.
*Participated in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ten-Go Operation Ten-Go], [[Yamato]]'s suicide mission, along with [[Yukikaze]], [[Yahagi]], [[Hatsushimo]], [[Asashimo]], [[Isokaze]], [[Hamakaze]], [[Suzutsuki]] and one other Destroyer not yet present in the game. She sunk during the operation, on April 7, 1945.
*Her name means "haze" or "mist".
**It was first carried by the second and last Torpedo Boat Destroyer of the Akatsuki class in 1901.
*Kasumi's '''Kai Ni B''' remodel is a reference to Type-B Destroyers (乙型駆逐艦 ''"Otsu-gata Kuchikukan"''), in other words Akizuki-class destroyers. Thus her Kai Ni B remodel enhances her Anti-Air capabilities, allows her to do Anti-Air cut-ins without the use of a Fire Director and carry large radars in exchange for reduced surface combat capabilities.
**Type-B Destroyers specialized as anti-aircraft escorts for carrier groups, and were the only destroyer class to be equipped with [[Type 21 Air Radar]] (radar exclusive to larger ships such as cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers). In exchange their guns were of smaller caliber, but capable of a higher fire rate and lighter in torpedo armament in comparison to most contemporary Japanese destroyers being equipped with one torpedo launcher instead of two.
***In-game the Akizuki-class is currently incapable of equipping large radars.

==Quests==
* Required by quests [[Quests#A30|A30]], [[Quests#A32|A32]], [[Quests#A46|A46]], [[Quests#B21|B21 and]] [[Quests#B38|B38]].
