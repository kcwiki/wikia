== Character ==

=== Appearance ===
*Isokaze wears a white and blue button-up serafuku with a yellow neckerchief (similar to [[Urakaze]], [[Tanikaze]] and [[Hamakaze]]) on top of a short Kagerou-class standard pleated skirt. On her back is her rigging, depth charge projectors and torpedo tubes which she wears sideways. Unlike most of the Kagerou-class, she wears elbow gloves. She wields two pistol-like guns, one resembles the standard 12.7 cm twin gun, the other resembles an Anti-Air gun. She has long black hair fading to a light green at the ends done up into small twintails with red ribbons holding the hair in place, red eyes drawn in a tsurime style and fairly large breasts. She wears gray high heels, similar to Urakaze, Hamakaze and Tanikaze, and similar to most ships that took part in Operation Ten-Go, she wears one kneesock higher than the other leg.
*When remodeled, she gains a radar-like hairpiece and changes her neckerchief for what looks like ropes on her collar.
*In her Mackerel Pike Festival seasonal artwork, she ditches her usual hairstyle in favor of a simple ponytail secured by a while hair tie.

=== Personality ===
*Isokaze has a stern and protective personality likened to that of Saber from ''Fate/Stay Night''. This is likely no coincidence as both Saber and Isokaze are voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, using similar tones of voice and speech patterns. In her hourly lines, it is revealed that Isokaze is bad at cooking; this trait extends to some merchandise and fan art of her.
