This is the improved-capability model of the Navy's main land-based attack aircraft the "Type 1 Land-based Attack Aircraft", which deployed from land air bases and carried out anti-ship attacks on enemy ships, anti-ground attacks on enemy airfields and such. Portions of the airframe were redesigned, as well as the addition of a rotating machine gun on the top of the airframe and the enhancement of the lateral machine guns, and even though its capabilities were limited, a plane-mounted radar was also installed.

A variant of the Type 1 Bomber, the Model 22A was an improvement all around with 2 new 20mm cannons, enlarged fuel tanks for even more range, adding doors to the bomb bay giving it the ability to carry even heavier torpedoes and a new air radar, the Type 3 Ku-Mk.6. It replaced the Model 11 by 1944 and continued to be built until the end of the war.
