A purely domestically produced triple gun mounting for use as a battleship's main battery that was prototyped at Kure Naval Arsenal.<br/>Slightly above 16 inches (40.6 cm), this 41 cm cannon was the world's largest battleship gun until the development of 46 cm cannon of type "Yamato". The Nagato-class battleship was equipped with this, to achieve the "Big 7" high damage and high accuracy that is far beyond the level of the world powers.
