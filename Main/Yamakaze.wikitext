==Character==
===Appearance===
* She has white skin tan, blue-green long waving hair with big dark-blue bow, blue eyes and black-white-blue uniform like everyone from Revised Shiratsuyu-class (except Suzukaze). According to her artist [https://twitter.com/kujouitiso/status/799630652769325056 Kujou Ichiso], she is shorter than her sisters after her due to her sinking first.

===Personality===
* Yamakaze is very shy and stoic. She is a fragile girl who wants someone to stand by her side, even though she denies it.

==Notes==
*[[Fall 2016 Event/E-2| Fall 2016 Event E-2]] Drop.

==Trivia==
* Her name means "Mountain Wind". In Japanese this also means wind coming down from the mountains during night. During the day this wind would be called Tanikaze.
* She was sunk by the USS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nautilus_(SS-168) ''Nautilus'' (SS-168)] on June 25 of 1942 while she was crossing to the inland sea approximately 60 kms southeast of  Yokosuka. The Nautilus took the last [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Torpedoed_Japanese_destroyer_Yamakaze_sinking_on_25_June_1942.jpg picture] of her while she was sinking with all her hands. She was the first of the Shiratsuyu-class to be sunk.
* Not counting Shimakaze and grouping the Akatsuki-class as part of the Special Type Destroyers, with the addition of Yamakaze the Shiratsuyu-class are the first class of destroyers to have all members be implemented since Kancolle was released.
* Due to having similar kanji with the Kagerou-class destroyer [[Arashi]], (嵐=Arashi, 山風＝Yamakaze) and the Japanese way of writing from top to bottom, letters that were sent to these ships were often mistaken with one another. To solve this problem letters to Yamakaze had to have a bigger gap between the two kanji and letters to Arashi required 'Arashi' in katakana after the Kanji.
* [https://twitter.com/kujouitiso/status/799630652769325056 According to her artist Kujou Ichiso], her shorter stature compared to all her other sister ships is a result of her being the first of her class to have been sunk.
