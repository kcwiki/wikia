===Map Guide===
*This is a Single-Fleet Map.
*Node B, C and K are submarine nodes.
*The Boss is a {{ShipLink|Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class/Flagship}} variant in an [[Combat/Abyssal Combined Fleet|Abyssal Combined Fleet]], utilizing Formation 4 (Line Ahead equivalent).
*There are many {{ShipLink|Light Carrier Nu-Class/Kai Elite|Light Carrier Nu-Class/Kai Flagship|text=Light Carriers Nu-Class Kai Elite and Flagship}} throughout the Map. Please have approximately 250~270 Air Power from the Start Point to have enough Fighter Power by the time you reach the Boss node. 
**The Aerial Node has a formation that requires at least 310 Air Power, but its effect on your fleet is less than the drawback of adding in too many fighters.

====Unlocking Shortcut L to O====
* To unlock nodes P, Q and the shortcut L -> O, you need to at least obtain A-Rank victory on node I.
** A fleet of the following will be able to route north towards Node I:
***'''3 CV(L/B)''' + 0-1 CA(V) + 0-1 (F)BB +  0-1 CL + '''1-2 DD''' + 0-1 SS(V)
****'''Note:''' You need at least 3 CV(L/B) and at least 1 DD + 1 CL/DD. SS(V) can override this but do note that those surface nodes can cause you a retreat more often than success.
**Node I has {{ShipLink|Harbour Summer Princess}} and {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp}}. Please bring your {{EquipmentLink|Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)|text=Daihatsu Tanks}} and {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)}}.
*<u>Regarding the Shortcut from L--> O</u>
**Using any Slow Ships, or having 3 or more FBB+CA(V)+CV(B) combined will direct you to L to K regardless of the shortcut being opened.

====Player-submitted Fleet====
*{{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|F|red|J|orange|L|red|O|red}} (shortcut utilized)
**1 FBB 1 CV 1 CVL 1 CL 2 DD

**1 FBB 1 CV 1 CVL 1 CA 1 CL 1 DD
*{{Event/Route|D|red|E|red|G|blue|I|red}} (for unlocking shortcut)
**3 CV(L/B) 1 (F)BB 2 DD
