|Introduction = 足柄よ。砲雷撃戦が得意なの。ふふ、よろしくね。
|Introduction/En = I'm Ashigara. My specialty is surface combat. Nice to meet you.

|Introduction/Kai Ni = 重巡足柄よ。砲雷撃戦なら私に任せて！ 一緒に勝利を掴み取りましょう！
|Introduction/Kai Ni/En = I'm heavy cruiser, Ashigara. If it's surface combat, leave it to me! Let's achieve victory together!

|Library = 私、足柄が英国の観艦式に参加した時のことよ。<br>まるで「飢えた狼のよう」と評価されたの。<br>当然よね!この精悍なボディ!<br>え?それは色気がないって嫌味じゃないかって?<br>そんなことあるわけ…ナイじゃない！
|Library/En = I am the Ashigara that participated in the English fleet review, you know.<br>I  was acknowledged as the 'Hungry Wolf'.<br>But of course! With this fearless body!<br>Eh? That's got nothing to do with my sex appeal? And wasn't even a praise?<br>There's... no way that's right!
|Library/Note = Ashigara represented Japan in the fleet review of George VI's coronation in 1937. She received comments like "Today is the first time I see a real warship, everything else I saw were ocean liners"(note) along with the nickname "Hungry Wolf" from British journalists, in response to her skinny hull design, poor living condition on-board, and very heavy armament compared to her British counterparts at that time. These comments were considered a praise by the IJN, and was even used as a propaganda material, but it actually wasn't.
Note: This comment was re-translated back into English from Japaneses sources, and may differ from the original. If someone found the original English text of this comment, please update it.

== Character ==

=== Personality ===
* Ashigara is a shipgirl with a strong and independent persona. She is also said to be a good cook (mostly curry) and has a voluptuous, womanly figure. Well-known for her obsession with victory, almost on a level equivalent to Sendai's obsession with night battles. She is nicknamed "Hungry Wolf", which was given during the naval review celebrating King George VI's coronation where she was Japan's representative. Because of this nickname, it's not uncommon to draw her with wolf ears and/or fangs.
* A running gag on Futaba is that she is a "Christmas Cake"; a woman above 25 who for whatever reason is unable to find a candidate for marriage and has gotten desperate, or one who is just exceptionally poor at romance. Where exactly this joke came from is unknown. It could be a play on her nickname "Hungry Wolf" - a joke on her being hungry for males, or could be a reference to the historical fact that several of her commanding officers were never married. It's also possible the joke came from her name "purity", which is usually thought of as a good thing but it's possible the joke is she's still "pure" (virgin, unmarried) despite her mid-to-late 20s look. One other theory about her being a "Christmas Cake" is related to the legend of the folk-hero Kintaro who was raised in Mount Ashigara by a Yama-uba , or in other words, a Mountain <strong>Hag</strong>. Like the "Nagamon" meme, this fan-created joke was featured in the anime.

==Trivia==
* Sunk in action by HMS Trenchant [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_of_8_June_1945 8th June 1945], with heavy loss of life, between Sumatra and Bangka Island, in the Bangka Strait in Indonesia.
** Wreck lies in relatively shallow water with extremely poor visibility; due to rumors of there being gold aboard her, several divers have been killed attempting to explore her wreck.
** Ashigara was the last major Japanese warship to be sunk in battle. While other ships were sunk later in the war, bombing raids sunk the rest at or near docks.
* Received her Kai Ni on 26th December, 2014.
* Appears in the anime adaption as a teacher for the Third Torpedo Squadron.
* Her name lives on as the second ship of the Atago Class Guided Missile Destroyer of the modern JMSDF.
