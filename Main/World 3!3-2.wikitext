** Fleet contains AO '''AND''' Fast Fleet, ~40% E, 60% G.

=='''Important:'''==
*[[World_1:_鎮守府海域#/1-5|1-5]] is required to unlock [[World_3/3-2|3-2]]
*Leveling in 3-2C with submarine tanking is still possible (like 3-2A) but not efficient anymore as the EXP you obtained is about half less than before.

==Compositions==
*According to the branching rules, it's possible to go {{Event/Route|C|red|E|blue|F|blue|L|red}} all the time by using the '''Fastest fleet consisting of 1 CL 5 DD while having 4 ships carrying radar'''. But due to the massive amount of {{EquipmentLink|New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler}} needed in order to effectively form a Fastest fleet, this comp is generally not recommended and thus can be ignored.

*{{Event/Route|C|red|E|blue|F|blue|L|red}} '''or''' {{Event/Route|C|red|G|purple|F|blue|L|red}}
**1 CL 5 DD
**6 DD
***Requires '''Fast+''' fleet and fleet carries at least 1 radar
*{{Event/Route|C|red|G|purple|H|red|F|blue|L|red}}
**1 CL 5 DD
**1 AO 1 CL 4 DD
**6 DD
***Requires '''Fast''' fleet as slow ships such as {{ShipLink|Samuel B. Roberts}} will force node {{Event/Route|H|red}}
***Assuming the fleet is '''Fast''', there is 50% chance it can skip node {{Event/Route|H|red}}

==Ammo Farming==
Bring 1 ship equipped with Damage Control Crew or Damage Control Goddess, continue the sortie to the ammo node after node A. Damage control will not be consumed. This DOESN'T work for (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B). Any other ship type will route to A.
