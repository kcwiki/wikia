==Character==
*'''[[Glossary#List of Vessels by Japanese Voice Actresses|Seiyuu]]''': [http://myanimelist.net/people/184/Hitomi_Nabatame Nabatame Hitomi] (生天目仁美)

==Trivia==
*[[Summer 2017 Event]] E-1 boss.
*Variant IV was introduced for the first time during the [[Winter 2018 Event]].
*Also appears in [[Summer_2017_Event/E-7|Summer 2017 Event E-7]] node H, J and K.
*Interestingly, her attacking line says "タベル" instead of "クラエ". Although both can mean "eat" in Japanese, the second one also means "take this" when you are fighting someone, so she is really asking you (or your kanmusu) to "eat" her torpedoes.
