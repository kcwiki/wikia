|Introduction = あなたが提督？ふうん。いいけど。伊勢型戦艦2番艦、日向よ。一応覚えておいて。
|Introduction/En = You're the Admiral? I see. Anyway. Second ship of the Ise class, Hyuuga. Remember me, if you would.

|Introduction/Kai = 伊勢型航空戦艦、日向…推して参る
|Introduction/Kai/En = Ise-class Aviation Battleship, Hyuuga... Pushing forward.

|Introduction/Kai Ni = 改装航空戦艦、日向だ。うん、更に航空艤装を強化した。何？心配するな。瑞雲の運用も可能だ。いけるな。
|Introduction/Kai Ni/En = I'm the remodelled aviation battleship, Hyuuga. Yes, I've strengthened my aviation equipment even more. What's that? Don't you worry. I can still use Zuiuns. Let's go.

|Library = 伊勢型戦艦2番艦、日向。<br>ああ、そうだ、あの伊勢と一緒に航空戦艦になったんだ。<br>もともとは、私の砲塔の事故もあるんだけどな。<br>呉で朽ち果てる迄、戦うつもりだ。
|Library/En = 2nd of the Ise-class battleships, Hyuuga.<br>Ah yes, I became an aviation battleship together with Ise you know.<br>That's originally because an accident happened on my 5th turret.<br>I'm fighting till I am sunk at Kure.
|Library/Note = In a maneuver on 5/5/1942, the 5th turret of Hyuuga exploded and required repairs. And at almost the same time (6/5~6/1942), the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated in Battle of Midway and lost 4 regular aircraft carriers. Under this situation, a flight deck was put on Hyuuga instead of being repaired to her original state in order to compensate for the loss of aviation force.

|Library/Kai = 航空運用能力を付与された航空戦艦、日向だ。<br>レイテでも奮戦したぞ。<br>戦略物資輸送作戦「北号作戦」も思い出深いな。<br>ああ、そうだ、海自のDDH「ひゅうが」に名は受け継がれている。

I got the ability of carrying aircrafts, and now I am an aviation battleship.<br>I fought bravely in Battle of Leyte Gulf.<br>An operation of transporting tactical goods "Operation Hoku-Go", it is one with a lot of memories for me.<br>Ah yes, JMSDF's DDH "Hyuuga" succeeds to my name.

==Character==
=== Appearance ===
* Hyuuga has short brown hair and brown eyes. Like many battleships, she wears a nontraditional miko outfit, with a brown skirt instead of a hakama. Somewhat like Akagi, (who had the same artist,) the art style and mostly-brown clothing makes her notably plainer-looking than most battleships. She is also drawn as rather broad-shouldered, so some artists make her a muscle girl or a busty one. When in a state of partial undress, she often is portrayed wearing a skintight black undershirt, although others up the "Japaneseness" and go for a fundoshi and sarashi. She often carries a sheathedkatana at her side.
* With her combat gear on, she is surrounded with turrets and cannons. In her "Aviation Battleship" Kai, her top left turret is replaced with a small, triangular flight deck.
* There is a growing trend of late with fan-artists depicting her with some strange obsession with Zuiuns.

=== Personality ===
* Hyuuga has a forthright, diligent personality. Like truly disciplined military personnel, she speaks with a level-headed matter-of-factness and little emotion, even while attacking or injured. She is also known for occasionally getting awfully deep and cryptic, constantly mentioning the new age of navy ships, frequently talking about the modern JMSDF helicopter destroyer Hyuuga that succeeds her name, mistaking Admiral for someone else in her second secretary line, and questioning what everyone is fighting for in her third.

==Notes==
* At Kai Ni, Hyuuga can perform [[Partials/Opening ASW|OASW]] even with less than 100 displayed ASW if she is equipped with at least 2 {{EquipmentLink|Ka Type Observation Autogyro|O Type Observation Autogyro Kai|O Type Observation Autogyro Kai Ni|text=autogryos}} OR at least 1 {{EquipmentLink|S-51J|S-51J Kai|text=helicopter}}.
{{:Ise/Multi-Angle Attacks}}

==Trivia==
*Named after an old province of Japan, Hyuuga. It literally means "towards the sun".
*Ran aground in shallow waters on July 27 1945, was raised and scrapped on July 2 1946 - July 4 1947.
*Her name still lives on the existing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDS_Hy%C5%ABga JDS Hyuuga-class carriers in JMSDF] along with Ise as a Hyuuga-class helicopter destroyer.
*The Ise-class are the poster girls of KanColle Arcade, SEGA's card-based arcade adaptation of the browser game.
