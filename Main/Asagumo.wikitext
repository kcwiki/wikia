[[File:1416213868652.png|thumb|240px|There's a spy among us...]]
* Her name means "morning cloud".
* After her addition during [[Fall 2014 Event]], some players quickly noticed the striking resemblance to the NPC girl featured in the game's error banner. Coincidence...?
* Started in Dec 1936 and finished just over a year later in March '38 she would see an active career in several of the wars major battles.
* At the opening of the Pacific War she was part of the covering force for the Malaya and Phillipines invasions, she then moved onto convoy protection for the Dutch East Indies campaign, where she would see heavy action at Java Sea, helping to sink ''HMS Electra'', though she was damaged in return. Following repairs she was part of the cover force for Midway, as well as the Battle of the Eastern Solomans and Battle of Santa Cruz. She would then see action at the First and Second battles of Guadalcanal, where she helped sink ''USS Monssen ''and rescue survivors from [[Kirishima]]. She was present at the Battle of Bismarck Sea and would again rescue survivors from several ships. Following this she escorted convoys.
* Sunk as part of Nishimura's Southern Force at Surigao Strait during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);"> 25 October 1944. </span>At 0320 her bow was blown off by a torpedo, part of a spread from USS ''McDermut'' which also struck [[Yamagumo]] and [[Michishio]]. ''Asagumo'' managed to control her flooding and retire to the south. Idling as dawn approached, either preparing for abandonment or rescuing survivors from [[Fusou]], she was attacked by PT-323 and further crippled at 0702. Shortly after, she was set upon by 9 US destroyers and the cruisers USS ''Denver'' and ''Columbia'', sinking at 0721 (at 10°04′N 125°21′E). 191 of her crew were killed while 39 survivors, including her captain, were taken prisoner.
* Wreck positively pinpointed by RV Petrel, a research ship funded by Paul Allen, aiming to locate all Nishimura ships in Surigao, Philippines. The ship has previously located [[Yamashiro]], found to be upside down, along with the entire Nishimura fleet with the exception of [[Mogami]], who sank farther.
