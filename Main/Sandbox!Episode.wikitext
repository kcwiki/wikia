__NOTOC__
''Newly-assigned [[Fubuki]] arrives at a naval base & is interrupted during a tour to sortie against a mysterious enemy.''

「It's Fubuki! With Regards!」
Ship girls are those whom possess souls of ships from days past. Now, at a naval base that is assigned such girls, [[Fubuki|Special Type Destroyer Fubuki]] arrives.

Along with her roommates [[Mutsuki]] & [[Yuudachi]], she tours the First Carrier Division's training grounds, where she cannot not look away from [[Akagi|Aircraft Carrier Akagi]]'s awe-inspiring figure.

Akagi's words - "I hope we can fight in the same fleet someday" - cause Fubuki's heart to throb.

==Story==
Within the water, a recitation of the Gosei is heard.

As the setting is described, an Abyssal fleet is shown. It consists of [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class]], [[Battleship Ru-Class]], [[Light Cruiser Ho-Class]], [[Light Cruiser To-Class]], [[Destroyer I-Class]], & [[Destroyer Ha-Class]]. Along with a palette shift, a it morphs into a different fleet consisting of Battleship Ru-Class, Light Cruiser Ho-Class, an unindentified Late Model, [[Destroyer_I-Class#Late_Model|Destroyer I-Class Late Model]], [[Heavy Cruiser Ri-Class]], & [[Torpedo Cruiser Chi-Class]].

They are engaged by a Naval Base's Fourth Fleet. It consists of [[Haruna]], [[Kirishima]], [[Kuma]], [[Tama]], [[Atago]], & [[Shoukaku]], whom is shooting [[Type 97 Torpedo Bomber]]s & [[Type 99 Dive Bomber]]s. The secretary ship [[Nagato]] is assisted by [[Mutsu]] with [[Ooyodo]] on comms. They're in search of the Abyssal's base.

Elsewhere, on a cliff, [[Akagi]] shoots a [[Type 97 Torpedo Bomber]] that soon flys by [[Fubuki]], whom is on a beach platform at a naval base.

The newly-assigned Fubuki procedes inside the main building, where she meets [[Mutsuki]]. After exchanging greetings, Mutsuki begins a tour, during which shots of [[NPC|Mamiya]] with the [[:Category:Akatsuki Class|Akatsuki Class]] & docks with [[Shiratsuyu]], [[Shigure]], [[Murasame]], & (possibly) [[Wakaba]] flash by. First stopping by their room as part of the Torpedo Squadron Three, they greet [[Yuudachi]], who is roped into the tour as well. Of the other members, [[Sendai]] & [[Jintsuu]] drop by due to Sendai's excitement while [[Naka]] is seen outside, promoting her idol activities to [[Asashio]] while [[Kagerou]], [[Samidare]], & others walk by.

A fight scene interrupts, with Kuma engaging the Destroyer I-Class Late Model, along with Tama & Atago, while one of Shoukaku's Type 97 Torpedo Bombers scouts for the enemy base. It's successful & Nagato orders the fleet to return.

Back at the base, [[Tone]] runs by, leading a destroyer procession of [[Shimakaze]], Ikazuchi, Inazuma, & [[Kisaragi]]. When Fubuki, Mutsuki, & Yuudachi stop in their classroom, Fubuki asks about combat experience. After Mutsuki mentions she's been in two battles, Fubuki fiddles with her fingers & when Yuudachi interprets that as twenty, Fubuki doesn't deny it before a Type 21 Zero Fighter interrupts them. Seeing it, Yuudachi & Mutsuki introduce the First Carrier Division of Akagi & [[Kaga]], whom are famous for a battle in which they, in a single fleet, took out dozens of Abyssals without receiving a hit.

Making their next stop the the carrier training grounds, they witness Akagi's practice with red striped [[Type 21 Zero Fighter]]s as Kaga looks on from inside the dojo. When spotted by Kaga, Fubuki clumsiness causes them to be stopped, leading to an exchange of greetings. Akagi's words strike a chord within Fubuki, especially the hope to be in the same fleet.

The next stop is Cafe Mamiya, where they partake in her famous super-size fruit parfaits. [[Kitakami]] & [[Ooi]] are also enjoying them, though Ooi is in a sour mood. Apparently, when those two are together, it's best not to talk to them. Before they get to fully enjoy the snacks; however, a siren activates, notifying them, along with Asashio, [[Ooshio]], [[Michishio]], [[Yuubari]], & others.

After a cut with a [[Glossary#List_of_vessels_by_artist|Shibafu]] illustration of Fubuki, Ooyodo starts the briefing to those assembled at a port - the Third Torpedo Squadron: Jintsuu, Fubuki, Mutsuki, Yuudachi, Sendai, & Naka; the First (Carrier) Task Force: Akagi, Kaga, Ikazuchi, Inazuma, [[Souryuu]], [[Hiryuu]]; & the Second Support Fleet: [[Kongo]], [[Hiei]], Akatsuki, Hibiki, Yuubari, & [[Mogami]]. Nagato takes over, describing the situation with the hostiles, the [[Enemy_Vessel|Abyssal Fleet]] that controls the seas around the naval base, as the Fourth Fleet rests in the docks. An image of the Abyssal Fleet detachment is shown, spearheaded by [[Anchorage Princess|Anchorage Hime]] & consisting of various units. <!-- could not clearly see --> The First Fleet is point while the Third Fleet recons.

Dai San launches first, flagship Jintsuu
Dai Ni, flagship Kongo?
Dai Icchi, flagship Akagi?

The assigned fleets depart, strangely, Fubuki appears to have difficulties.

Troubles arise in the first fleet, where Fubuki seems inexperienced. It turns out she has no experience, but with coaxing from the others, she pushes on. They encounter a detachment of [[Destroyer Ha-Class|Destroyer Ha-Classes]], but [[Destroyer Ro-Class|Destroyer Ro-Classes]] interrupt their success. During repositioning & engagement, Fubuki shaken up by a near hit. During further repoositioning, the Third Fleet is shown engaging & taking damage as well.

Suddenly, Fubuki is ambushed by a [[Destroyer I-Class|Destroyer I-Class Elite]]. It's lunge misses. It aims for a point-blank shot. However, it is struck - Sendai, Jintsuu, & Naka are rushing to her aid. During a second lunge, Fubuki fails to halt it.

The Second Fleet's air wing strikes, with [[Type_21_Zero_Fighter|Type 21 Zeroes]] <!-- presumably? --> sinking the Destroyer I-Class Elite & protecting Fubuki. Akagi & Kaga sortie another wave, [[Type_99_Dive_Bomber|Type 99 Dive Bombers]], <!-- presumably? --> wreaking havoc. Yet when angling for Anchorage Hime, they fail to penetrate her defenses. As she begins a counterattack, Hiei & Kongo attack her as well. Unfortunately, no joy. Akagi launches a third wave, [[Type_97_Torpedo_Bomber|Type 97 Torpedo Bombers]]. <!-- presumably? --> They crack her defenses & the Type 99 Dive Bombers wrap things up.

Fubuki couldn't bring herself to refuse deployment due to the commander's encouragement

Abyssal Destroyers are somewhat like whales.

Fleet 3: 2 [[Destroyer Ha-Class]], 3 [[Destroyer Ro-Class]], 3 [[Destroyer I-Class]] <!-- Unsure. Some may be Late Models as well -->

Damaged: Sendai, Naka, Mogami

Akagi tells Dai san to retreat, Ikkosen (formal name) will handle the rest (& not the rest of the fleet?). The destroyers don't.

Fairy fist!

The others can only admire Akagi & Kaga in the carrier's trademark pose. <!-- Feel free to edit or remove this line -->

Indeed, Nagato is pleased by the results. <!-- Feel free to edit or remove this line -->

As the day comes to a close, Fubuki somberly stares into the sunset upon a cliff. However, the admiral takes time now to step in & reinvigorate Fubuki, sending her back to the rest of the Third Fleet as they wind down from the day. Fubuki really idolizes Akagi & wants to be her escort.
