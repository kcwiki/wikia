{{Equipment

|en = The Suisei, developed as the successor to the Type 99, was a high-performance carrier-based dive bomber with water-cooled engine. This is the squadron that was equipped with the anti-ground and anti-air Type 3 bomb, well-trained and experienced in the use of this hard-to-utilize weapon, and has been transferred to the what-if remodeled aviation battleships Ise Kai Ni and Hyuuga Kai Ni. This squadron will also join in anti-ground attacks and display their effectiveness in these bombing runs.

<!--Liberal translation, please correct the second sentence as necessary-->

|notes = This is one of the few dive bombers in-game that would allow player-side carriers to attack landbases during daytime.

|trivia = The Type 3 Cluster bomb is a kind of incendiary cluster bomb, not different from the [[Type 3 Shell]] fired from warships' main guns. This trait would make this particular kind of bomb effective for land attacks (hence the squadron's ability to attack installations).
