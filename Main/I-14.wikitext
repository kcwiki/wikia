==Character==
*Refers to herself as "Iyo".

===Appearance===
===Personality===
*I-14, or Iyo as she prefers to be called, acts as a foil to I-13; she is very energetic and outgoing, compared to I-13's timid personality. She is also very fond of alcohol.

==Notes==
* [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Winter_2017_Event/E-3 Winter 2017 Event E-3] Clear Reward.
* She and her sister [[I-13]] are the first playable submarines with '''3 equipment slots''' after remodel. I-14 also comes with an unbuildable [[Prototype Seiran]] on remodel.
*I-14's aircraft slots are unevenly distributed but it also comes with a plus side as player can freely manage her setup effectively.

==Trivia==
*I-14 was the second of two Type AM <span style="font-weight:normal;">(also known as the "I-13 class") </span>submarines, which were developed off the preceding Type A2 class, featuring much larger aircraft hangars than their predecessors to support the operation of [[Seiran]] seaplane bombers.
*I-14 was part of the four-submarine fleet (alongside [[I-13]], [[I-400]] and [[I-401]]) assigned to ''Operation Arashi'', a planned operation to attack Ulithi Atoll, at the time the US Navy's largest naval base in the Pacific, near the end of the war in July 1945. I-14 and I-13 were to participate in ''Operation Hikari'', a preceding operation which involved the delivery of [[Saiun]] recon aircraft to Truk Anchorage in preparation for the attack. Only I-14 was able to complete her assigned mission due to her sister ship I-13 being sunk en route earlier by a US anti-submarine mission.
*Before Operation Arashi could begin in earnest, the Japanese announced their surrender in August 15, 1945, resulting in the mission being cancelled. I-14, who was already en route to Ulithi alongside the other surviving submarines in the fleet, was surrendered to the US Navy as a war prize, and then sent to Hawaii for technological inspections.
*Ultimately, to prevent the Soviet Union from performing their own inspections on the submarine, I-14 was sunk off Oahu, Hawaii as a floating target by naval gunfire.
*Wreck located on February 17, 2009.
*Iyo's hard drinking habit comes from the [http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2785151 many] [http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2785175 incidents] the original I-14 had with alcohol.
