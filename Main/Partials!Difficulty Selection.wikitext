Each map in this event has four (4) difficulty levels (a.k.a. operation ranks) the player can choose from:

<div style="float:left; margin:1px; width:62px" class="thumbimage">[[File:EventMedal-Casual.png|70px]]</div>
<div style="float:left; margin:1px; width:62px" class="thumbimage">[[File:EventMedal-Easy.png|70px]]</div>

</div>
*Casual ('''丁''') (Unlocks at '''[[:Tutorial:_How_to_Play#The_Main_Screen|HQ level]] 1''')
*Easy ('''丙''') (Unlocks at '''[[:Tutorial:_How_to_Play#The_Main_Screen|HQ level]] 1''')
*Medium/Normal ('''乙''') (Unlocks at '''[[:Tutorial:_How_to_Play#The_Main_Screen|HQ level]] 35''')
*Hard ('''甲''') (Unlocks at '''[[:Tutorial:_How_to_Play#The_Main_Screen|HQ level]] 80''')

The operation rank affects enemy patterns, boss health and strength, the number of times the player has to sink the boss in order to clear the map and the drop rates of ships. Different ranks reward different [[Medal|medals]], [[Equipment|pieces of equipment]] and/or [[Shop|materials]] upon clearing a map. The higher the operation rank, the better the reward.

However, new ship rewards are available on all difficulty levels, and you only have to clear the final event map on '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' to get the exclusive [[Medal#First_Class_Medal|'''First-class medal''']].

You can choose the difficulty level for each individual map separately. However, you will '''NOT''' be able to select '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' for a map if you cleared the previous map on '''<span style="color:blue">Casual</span>/<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>'''. You must clear the previous map at least on '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium/Normal</span>'''.

*【<span style="color:#f00;">'''NOT POSSIBLE'''</span>】'''<span style="color:blue">Casual</span>/<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>'''
*【<span style="color:#5a5;">'''POSSIBLE'''</span>】'''<span style="color:#da6;">(Medium/Normal)</span>'''/'''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>'''
*【<span style="color:#5a5;">'''POSSIBLE'''</span>】'''<span style="color:blue">Casual</span>/<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>'''/'''<span style="color:#da6;">(Medium/Normal)</span>'''/'''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">(Medium/Normal)</span>'''
*【<span style="color:#5a5;">'''POSSIBLE'''</span>】'''<span style="color:blue">Casual</span>/<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>'''/'''<span style="color:#da6;">(Medium/Normal)</span>'''/'''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:blue">Casual</span>/<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>'''

It is also possible to change the difficulty level afterwards, however:
*If you drop to a '''lower''' difficulty (e.g. from Hard to Normal/Easy), the current HP/TP bar value (the one you have the moment you drop down) will increase by 25% of the '''new maximum''' and you will retain '''ALL''' unlocking/phases done on the previous difficulty level.
*'''However''', if you change to a '''higher''' difficulty (e.g. from Easy to Hard), <span style="color:red;">'''the boss's HP/TP bar will be reset'''</span> upon doing so and '''ALL''' unlocking/debuffs/phases will be reset as well. In short, '''you will lose your entire map progress!'''

Once the map is cleared (boss HP bar is depleted, boss is defeated, and the HP bar is no longer visible in the map):
* '''You CAN NO LONGER re-adjust the difficulty level''', but can still farm the map on the difficulty you have chosen to clear the map with.
* The enemy patterns '''revert''' back to pre-final patterns.
<!--
As a general rule of thumb:
* If you do not possess a single second-[[Remodel|remodel]] ship, your difficulty selection should be '''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>'''.
* If you have second-[[Remodel|remodel]] ships but your Combined Fleet is weaker than a single sortied fleet because it cannot hit anything reliably, your difficulty selection should be '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>'''.
* If your Combined Fleet has better performance than a single fleet, your difficulty selection should be '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>'''.
