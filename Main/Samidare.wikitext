== Character ==

=== Appearance ===
* Samidare has very long blue hair with a gradient (lighter at the bottom) that notably spirals towards the bottom. She also has swept bangs and very large blue eyes.
* She wears a special sleeveless shirt version of a serafuku with a white skirt unique to her and her younger sister, Suzukaze. She also wears elbow gloves and black thighhighs to create a zettai ryouiki. Her battle kit includes two pistol-like double-barreled cannon turrets, and an oversized backpack-like torpedo launcher.

=== Personality ===
* The historical destroyer Samidare committed friendly fire against Hiei and collided with Shiratsuyu, giving her the in-game personality trait of klutziness. For example, in her Christmas 2015 and Valentines 2016 voice lines, she is heard dropping a cake. In fanon however, Inazuma far overshadows her in this regard, so she tends to be more the quiet "beautiful hair" girl. Occasionally though, she's shown causing trouble for Hiei. Historically, Samidare rescued the survivors from Yuubari, so the two are frequently depicted together, often in a big sister/little sister or romantic relationship.

==Trivia==
*Her name refers to ”梅雨”, which is a rainy season which happens around the end of spring and early summer. During this time it is humid and the sky is often overcast. It is the subject of many artistic works such as songs, poetry, and paintings in East Asia, specifically Japan, Korea and China.
*Sunk, 26 August 1944 at Palau ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Samidare&params=08_10_N_134_38_E_ 08°10′N 134°38′E]).
*She is one of the five starter ships.

==Quests==
*Required by Quests [[Quests#A54|A54]] and [[Quests#B46|B46]].
