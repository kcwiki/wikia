===Participation requirements===
<span style="font-size:19px;color:#f00;"><b><center>Check if you fulfilled these requirements if you can't sortie to event maps!</center></b></span>
* Must have a 75% sortie win ratio
* Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships
* Must have 20 free equipment slots
* Must have formed a [[Combined Fleet]] to sortie in E-2, E-4 and E-6, and no combined fleet for E-1, E-3, E-5.
{{clr}}[[File:KanColle-150207-20351201.png|thumb|Click that option circled in Red.]][[File:Winter_Difficulty_Settings.png|thumb|Un-highlighted: Current Difficulty]]

===Special Mechanics===
#Selectable and changeable difficulty
#*This event has 3 ranks: easy (丙), medium (乙), hard (甲).
#*HQ Level 35 unlocks medium, HQ Level 80 unlocks hard.
#*You can choose the difficulty in each map separately.
#** However, this time around, you will not be able to jump from Easy -> Hard after a map. To be able to use "Hard" setting, you must clear the previous map either on Medium or Hard itself. Only '''''jumping up two difficulty levels''''' is not allowed, other combinations stick to the old rules.
#***【<span style="color:#f00;">BAD</span>】'''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' (''not possible because easy jumped to hard'')
#***【OK】'''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>'''
#***【OK】'''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>'''
#***【OK】'''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>'''
#***【OK】'''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#5a5;">Easy</span>'''
#***【OK】'''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#f00;">Hard</span>''' > '''<span style="color:#da6;">Medium</span>'''
#*When the difficulty is changed, '''the boss's health bar will be reset'''.
#*Once the map is cleared (boss HP bar is depleted and killed), '''you CANNOT change the difficulty anymore''', but can still farm the map on the difficulty used to clear it
#*Different difficulties give different medals, equipment and materials when clearing the maps.
#[[Combined Fleet]] in E-2, E-4 and E-6
#Manual Selection - As seen in many maps, you can manually select the path that you want to go instead of relying on RNG or branching rules to bring you there.
#Aerial Combat - In some map, you'll notice that there's only Air combat, which takes place twice instead of the usual shelling. This is an Aerial Combat node where only your CV/CVL or other ships with launch-able planes will be taking part in combat.

==Event Maps==
<div style="padding: 10px 0;"> 
See ''Enemy Encounter Reporting'' threads for detailed formation on each node. <br/><br />'''Special Note: '''In this event, after clearing a map, the boss' pattern will ''revert'' to their original form, ''unlike previous events''.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:18px"><center>'''Regarding Drops with "Shipname (Difficulty +) Format'''</center></span>

In drop reports, red ship names indicate notable drops. Some of the ships will be listed as "Shipname (Difficulty +)." For instance, ''if it reads Isokaze (Medium +) it means that, so far, reports say Isokaze drops for Medium or above'', that ''does not mean Isokaze does not drop'' in Easy, just that there hasn't been enough reports to show Isokaze also drops on Easy. Even if drop reports exist, it does not mean the drop rate would be equal on different difficulties, and the accuracy of those reports is not 100% guaranteed either.</div>

*The Wurfgerät 42 shines greatly in this map since at least 2 DDs are needed as escort for the combined fleet and the boss is an installation type. Equip one of these on each DD and/or CLs and equip Type 3 shells for other ships that can use it.
* The west route (choosing I from F) is generally undesirable. It is longer and thus eats more supplies, is more difficult (an air combat node and a difficult surface battle node), and has chances of dead-ending in resource nodes before reaching the boss without having notably better drops.

*North route (FGIMO) is the easiest route to the boss node, but the middle route (FHKMO) gives more chance to acquire Roma.
**A [[Searchlight]] is recommended on second fleet flagship for the node I night battle to reduce [[Battleship Princess]]'s cut-in rate.
**AP Ammo cut-in setups are recommended on battleships for punching through the boss's high armor.
**Surface task force is recommended for increased first fleet firepower and protecting the second fleet until the boss node night battle.
***Air superiority can be achieved (AFP 243) at the preboss node (M) with 2 CVL or 1CV and 2-3 BBV.

*South Route (DEJNMO) is viable but reliant on a well-prepared escort fleet in equipment and levels.
**A [[Searchlight]] is recommended on second fleet flagship for the node J night battle to reduce enemy cut-in rates.
**Ooyodo can be useful on this route for carrying Night Scouts and Star Shells.
**Three Torpedo Cruisers can and should be included in the escort fleet.

*Node K can be easily repeated for chances at Roma by using fleets with submarines to tank damage at node H.

==Event-specific FAQ==
;Is there any [[Akizuki]] or [[Prinz Eugen]] drop in the event?
:There are no trustworthy reports on it so far.

;Should I reset the gauge to farm for drops?
:Starting from this event, boss pattern will no longer stay in final form after clearing the event. Instead they will revert to original pattern, so there's no need to reset if you were just concerned about the pattern. However, because it is impossible to change the difficulty after clearing a map, if you wish to clear a map on a different difficulty from the difficulty you are farming in, it would be wise to constantly reset the gauge by changing the difficulty back and forth to avoid accidentally clearing a map at an unintended difficulty level.

;Can I get all new ships, including the drop-only [[Roma]] and [[Takanami]] in all difficulties, including Easy?
:Yes. For further details about where you can obtain these drops, read the tables above. If you don't understand what those representations mean, then read the explanations under section heading. But do note that the drop rates in easier difficulties are likely to be lower than hard.

;What is this [[File:tag.png|frameless]] that appears on my ships?
:They are tags that mark your girls if they sortied to certain event maps, and can no longer be sortied to other restricted maps on Medium or Hard.
:In this event, blue text means the ship has been used in E-3, and can no longer be used on E-4 or E-5's medium or hard.
:Green text means the ship has been used in E-4, and can no longer be used on E-3 or E-5's medium or hard.
:Brown text means the ship has been used in E-5, and can no longer be used on E-3 or E-4's medium or hard.

;My ships are these ships with these levels and I have these equipments, what difficulty should I choose?
:Compare rewards across difficulties, check what difficulty that ship you want will drop at by looking at tables above, check your resources and buckets count, read enemy formations at different difficulties and then make your choice. If you still can't decide, do a trial run on the highest difficulty and see if you can handle it. If not, then decrease the difficulty.
