==Character==
[[File:Anime ikazuchi.png|thumb|160px]]

===Appearance===
*She has reddish-brown hair that is slightly disheveled in a similar manner to her sisters. The left side is adorned with a small red hairpin.
**Another trait shared with her sisters is the matching colour of her eyes and hair.

===Personality===
* Very boisterous and a bit overconfident in contrast to her sister-ship [[Inazuma]]'s timid behavior.
* Aspires to be an onee-san-like figure, as evidenced by her desire to be relied upon by the admiral. This trait which contrasts with the [[:Category:Akatsuki Class|class]]' somewhat juvenile behavior is emphasized as her moé point in a similar fashion to [[Akatsuki]].

==Trivia==
*Her name means "thunder". ''Ikazuchi'' is a more poetic or archaic pronunciation of the character "雷", which is usually pronounced "kaminari", thus her intro quote.
**If you combine Ikazuchi and [[Inazuma|Inazuma's]] kanji characters, it forms the word ''[[Raiden]]'' (雷電), or electricity. Kongou calls both of them as such as a pet name in the [[Anime|anime adaptation]].
**The first Torpedo Boat Destroyers (TBDs) procured by the Japanese Navy ever was the Ikazuchi class in 1897~1899.
**In the JMSDF, her name is used again, firstly leading her own class of destroyer escorts, and most recently, in the Murasame type of destroyers.
*Sunk in action April 13, 1944 south of [[Wikipedia:Guam|Guam]] ([http://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Ikazuchi&params=10_13_N_143_51_E_type:landmark_region:XZ_region:#regional 10°13′N 143°51′E]). There were no survivors. Her wreck is near the Marianas Trench, so her depth is between 3-5 km below sea level.

==Quests==
*Composition: [[Quests#A10|A10]].
*Sortie (Any): [[Quests#B12|B12]].
*Sortie (Clearance): [[Quests#B42|B42]].
*Sortie (Clearance): [[Quests#B44|B44]].
