===[[Events/Mechanics#Difficulty_Selection|Difficulty Selection]]===
Starting from Winter 2015 Event, players can choose from the difficulty they want to play on each event map among three available difficulties: Easy (丙), Medium (乙), and Hard (甲).

You need to have a HQ level of 35 for Medium and 80 for hard. Different difficulties yield different rewards with harder ones either giving more items or a better version of the same item. However, ship rewards are always given regardless of difficulty. Drops also differ with some ships available only on medium to hard maps, and drop rates for some ships are statistically better. Enemy compositions also differ with bosses and their escorts are usually weaker on easier difficulties. To finish the next map on Hard, you will need to finish the previous map on Medium or Hard. 

Clearing the last map on Hard (甲) mode will reward a First Class Medal. It is not required to clear all maps on hard but to gain access to last map's hard difficulty, you'll need to clear the pre-final map with Medium or above.

===[[Events/Mechanics#Difficulty_Selection|HP/TP Bar Scaling]]===
The amount of HP (or [[Events/Mechanics#Map-specific_Mechanics|{{Tooltip|TP|Transport Load-Off}}]]) required to clear a map usually varies depending on an [[Experience_and_Rank#Difficulty_Tiers|Admiral's HQ Level]] (this was first [https://github.com/KC3Kai/KC3Kai/issues/712 observed] during [[Summer 2015 Event]]). The higher the HQ Level is, the more kills (or [[Events/Mechanics#Map-specific_Mechanics|{{Tooltip|TP|Transport Load-Off}}]]) may be required to complete a map.
