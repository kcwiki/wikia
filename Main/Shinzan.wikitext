|trivia = A four engined heavy bomber project for the IJN. Work was started in 1939 when the abandoned DC-4E airliner was purchased by Japan and reversed engineered to create the G5N1 Shinzan ("Deep mountain") - a prototype was produced and flew in 1941 with three more following after. Though the game description compares it to the B29 in size the two were miles apart in performance, the type proved to be overweight and the engines unreliable and under-powered. In a bizarre effort to improve the project two more planes were built and fitted with newer ''less'' powerful engines. Unsurprisingly the project was shelved and four of the planes were converted for transport use. None survived and data on their bombload is unknown.
