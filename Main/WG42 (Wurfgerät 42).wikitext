The WG42 is a ship-borne rocket launcher developed from another country (Germany) for anti-ground and anti-shipping attacks. It can be used aboard U-boats where it saw practical use. Mainly effective for anti-ground strikes, suffered from poor accuracy; however, it can be fired from a shallow depth similar to the anti-ground submarine missiles of today.

*Grants a damage bonus against [[Installation Type]] enemies.

For [[Installation_Type#Soft-Skinned|Soft-Skinned]] Installations, the bonus for one equipped WG42 is +75 to [[Damage_Calculation#Basic_Attack_Power|Basic Attack Power]] (applied after [[Type 3 Shell]]'s 250% damage bonus, affects both day and night battle), ~110 for two, ~140 for three, and ~160 for four<ref>http://jbbs.shitaraba.net/bbs/read.cgi/netgame/13745/1400461230/917-922</ref><ref>http://jbbs.shitaraba.net/bbs/read.cgi/netgame/13745/1439793270/160</ref>. For example, a non-modernized CAV with 60 total firepower equipped with two Main Guns, WG42, and [[Type 3 Shell]] will have (60 * 2.5 + 75) * 1.2 = 270 Pre/Post-Cap Attack Power in normal condition for Double Attack in Night Battle.

For [[Supply Depot Princess]], an additional post-cap modifier is also applied: 125% for one WG42, and {{Tooltip|~162.5%|Speculated to be 1.25 * 1.3}} for 2-4<ref>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IUaThqAWDtV97bXuuZaQVz4eMdVaDoaakYKe9GrpMu0</ref>.

Unlike ASW, ships equipped with this are '''<u>NOT</u>''' forced to attack an installation-type enemies and will choose randomly as usual. Equipping this also enables submarines to attack installations.
