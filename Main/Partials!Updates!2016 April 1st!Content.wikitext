====[[Underway Replenishment]] & [[Combat Ration]] system update====
[[File:Manual Food Consumption.png|thumb|right]]
* You can now '''freely choose''' whether or not you want to consume these items regardless of any item trigger conditions, '''but only when your fleet goes to a boss node'''.
* Option appears after spinning the compass.
** 許可: Allow use
** 却下: Dismiss
* All other trigger conditions still apply (i.e. [[Combat Ration]]s can still trigger randomly and [[Underway Replenishment]] still triggers if the fleet's average resources fall below a certain point)
* [[Combat Ration|Combat Rations]] & [[Canned Mackerel|Canned Mackerels]] now give a damage boost to [[:Category:Landing Craft|Landing Crafts]] & [[:Category:Special Amphibious Landing Craft|Special Amphibious Landing Crafts]] when they trigger.


====Seasonal Content====

====Visual Changes====
* Aerial Combat animations for seaplane bombers like [[Zuiun]] and seaplane fighters like [[Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai]] have been updated.
* Land-based planes, once implemented, will have a similar animation.


====Other====
* Changes to the game's startup API temporarily caused several viewers to not load their info tabs properly, but this has since been fixed. Just get the latest update.
* {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}}'s equipment pool coding was messed up shortly after the update, which prevented her from equipping [[:Category:Landing Craft|Landind Crafts]], [[List of Secondary Guns by stats|Secondary Guns]] and [[Emergency Repair Personnel|Emergency]] [[Emergency Repair Goddess| Repairs]], but allowed her to equip [[Prototype 51cm Twin Gun Mount|Prototype 51cm Twin Gun Mounts]]. This has already been fixed, unfortunately.
* Abyssal Carriers incorrectly displayed [[Abyssal Liberation Land-based Dive Bomber|land-based dive bombers]] as their equipment during the launch animation. This was just a visual bug without any bearing on their actual equipment and has already been fixed.<noinclude>
