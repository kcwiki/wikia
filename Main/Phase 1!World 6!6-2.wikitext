===Tips===
* This map uses the [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=3)]] formula, this means that '''LoS from equipments weights 3 times more''' than usual.
===Possible Fleet compositions===
*{{Event/Route|B|red|F|blue|H|red|K|red}} or {{Event/Route|B|red|F|blue|I|red|K|red}}
**1(F)BB(V) 1CV(B) 2DD 2CA(V)
**1(F)BB(V) 1CV 2DD 2CLT
**1(F)BB(V) 1CV(B) 2DD 1CA(V) 1CLT
*** There is a LoS check for F -> I. Using either composition that fails this LoS check will to go to H instead. However, H does not contain any Flagship Kai-grade enemies, so failing this LoS check may be preferable. There is also a LoS check for H -> K. When the [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=3)]] LoS value is between 40 and 43, it guarantees going H and passing the second LoS check.
