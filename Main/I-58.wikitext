==Character==
===Appearance===
* The [[:Category:Submarines|submarines]] share the same base uniform, consisting of a blue school swimsuit. I-58 wears a white serafuku with a pink scarf-like ornament on it.
**I-58 herself has short pink hair with a peculiar hair ornament consisting of a golden clip holding two sakura petals & two ribbons that appear to be connected to her ahoge. 

=== Personality ===
* I-58 is high-spirited and carefree and loves the sea. She is well known for having puns related to her name, Goya, with many of her lines reflecting that; one example is her MVP line, where she mentions chanpurū, an Okinawan stir-fried dish which contains bitter melon (also known as gōyā).
* Makes frequent use of でち (''-dechi'') at the end of her lines.

==Notes==
* [[Summer 2013 Event]], E-2, E-3, E-4 random boss drop.
* Remodels into an aircraft-carrying submarine that has a doubled [[Docking|repair time]].

==Trivia==
* Refers to herself as ''Goya'', that is, ''go'' & ''ya'' or ''five'' & ''eight''.
* Was sunk as a target on April 1st, 1946
* A distant cousin of [[I-19]], as both are ''Type-B'' submarines.
** I-58 was a I-54 class submarine, also called Type B Model 2. The type B submarines were the fastest on surface, but the Model 2 were slower than the original type B (which I-19 belongs to)
* I-58 sank the [[wikipedia:USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|''USS Indianapolis'' (CA-35)]] on route to [[wikipedia:Leyte_(island)|Leyte]] on July 30th, 1945, four days after it delivered the components for the Little Boy to Tinian.
* Wreck identified on September 17, 2017, with its stern projecting upwards, nearly perpendicular to the seabed.
