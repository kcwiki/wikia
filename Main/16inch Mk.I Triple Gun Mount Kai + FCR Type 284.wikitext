|en = The Nelson-class was a class of super-dreadnoughts that were built with 16 inch guns in the land of black tea as part of the Big Seven under the naval treaty. These large-caliber triple battleship guns are an improved version of the ones that were used as their main armament and carried entirely in the front. Furthermore, the Type 284 Fire-Control Radar that is used in tandem with the guns allows highly accurate radar guided shelling. You can expect an excellent performance in combat when using them on ships like the Nelson-class or other battleships from the land of black tea.
