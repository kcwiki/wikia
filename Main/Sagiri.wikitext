===Seasonal Quotes===
{{ShipSeasonalQuotes}}

==Character==
===Appearance===

*Sagiri wears a periwinkle school uniform that matches with her sister ship [[Amagiri]]. This uniform is different in comparison to her other elder sister ships of this class. 
*She has silver hair with a darker periwinkle ribbon/bow tied into it. Her eyes match the color of this ribbon in her hair. 

===Personality===
*She appears to be the more reserved, and less confident one between herself, and [[Amagiri]]. She is hinted to be the more responsible, and mature of the two as seen in her idle quote where she is picking up Amagiri's clothing off the floor. 
*Her personality can be seen as very endearing due to how happy she gets when she accomplishes things such as getting MVP.
*She has signs of anxiety, and PTSD from being sunk which can be noted when she is damaged in battle since she begins to panick senselessly. Her PTSD is especially affected by Submarines due to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Sagiri Japanese destroyer Sagiri] being struken by a Dutch submarine that had her catch on fire, and explode. 
*She can be seen as very affectionate towards the admiral, and comes off as a worried wife in some situations. She also tries to make the admiral feel at home as shown in her hourly quotes. 

==Notes==
==Trivia==
* Laid down in March 1929 she was quickly built and launched by the end of December the same year.
* She escorted and covered landings during the opening stages of Japan's invasion of China and patrolled the area for a duration after. At the beginning of WW2 she was involved in the invasion of Malaya.
* She holds the distinction of being the first Japanese warship sunk by allied naval forces of WW2, being torpedoed by the Dutch submarine HNLMS K XVI on Christmas day 1941 somewhere in East Asian waters.
** Like with [[Kuma]], also a victim of illegal metal scrap salvaging.
