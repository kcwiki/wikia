==Map Guide==
*World 7-3 is a 2 Phase Map
*Historical Routings exist in this Map, similar to Events '''(See Below)'''
*The Boss HP Gauge Bar will reset every 1st day of each month, like World 7-2 and Extra Operations. Clearing 7-2 is not required.
===Phase 1===
This Phase requires you to defeat the {{ShipLink|Destroyer Ro-Class/Late Model|Destroyer Ro-Class/Late Model Elite|text=Enemy Destroyers}} 1st Boss Node {{Event/Route|E|red}} and destroy the HP Gauge Bar in order to move into Phase 2.
*Fleet: {{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}} + 3 DD
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|E|red}}

===Phase 2===
Phase 2 requires you to defeat the Boss {{ShipLink|Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class Elite}} in Node {{Event/Route|P|red}}
====Historical fleet====
*{{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}}, {{ShipLink|Kamikaze}}, {{ShipLink|Ashigara Kai Ni|text=Ashigara}} are required.
*All the compositions listed below require at least '''Fast''' fleet
**{{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}}, {{ShipLink|Kamikaze}}, {{ShipLink|Ashigara Kai Ni|text=Ashigara}} 1 CL(T)/AV 2 DD
**{{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}}, {{ShipLink|Kamikaze}}, 1 CA(V) 1 CL(T)/AV 2 DD ('''Fast+''')
***Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|D|red|G|blue|P|red}}
**{{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}}, {{ShipLink|Kamikaze}}, {{ShipLink|Ashigara Kai Ni|text=Ashigara}} 1 AV 1 CL/CLT 1 DD
***Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|D|red|G|blue|J|red|P|red}} 
**{{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}}, {{ShipLink|Kamikaze}}, {{ShipLink|Ashigara Kai Ni|text=Ashigara}} 1 CA(V) 1 DD '''(5 Ships)'''
**{{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}}, {{ShipLink|Kamikaze}}, 1 CA(V)/CLT/AV 3 DD ('''Fast+''')
***Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|I|blue|J|red|P|red}}
**{{ShipLink|Haguro Kai Ni|text=Haguro}}, {{ShipLink|Ashigara Kai Ni|text=Ashigara}} 1 CLT/AV 3 DD
***Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|D|red|G|blue|I|blue|M|red|P|red}}
***Not recommended as there is ammo penalty at the boss node. Only use this if you don't have [[Kamikaze]]

====Non-historical fleet====
*2 CA(V) 1 CL 3 DD ('''Fast+''' fleet)
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|I|blue|L|purple|M|red|P|red}}
*2 CA(V) 1 CL 3 DD ('''Fastest''' fleet)
**Route: {{Event/Route|A|blue|C|red|I|blue|J|red|P|red}}
