{{Equipment

|en = A large 61cm torpedo that was developed as the successor of the obsolete 53cm torpedo.
The triple torpedo launcher was mounted onto various ships such as the special-type destroyers of the Fubuki-class as their main armament.
This armament is an improved model where the original torpedoes were replaced with type 93 oxygen torpedoes and lessons learnt from actual combat were incorporated,
resulting in a thoroughly improved and fine-tuned late-model oxygen torpedo equipment.
