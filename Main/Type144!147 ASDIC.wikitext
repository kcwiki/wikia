An improved version of the ASDIC submarine detection system developed in the country of black tea. While it is equivalent to our active sonar systems, the accumulation of the technology and the combined deployments of the Type 144 and Type 147 greatly increased its accuracy. Combined with advanced Anti-submarine weapons like the Hedgehog or Squid, a stronger ASW ability is achieved.
