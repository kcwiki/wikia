|Introduction = Hi！　私の名前はJanus！　そうよ、あのJervisの僚艦の…<br>……え？　知らない？　完っ全にモグリね。いい？<br>しっかり覚えておきなさい！
|Introduction/En = Hi, my name is Janus. Yes, from the same flotilla as Jervis... Eh, you don't know me? You really are unqualified to be admiral. Listen up, alright? You better remember this. 
|Introduction/Note = 

|Introduction/Kai = Hi、J級駆逐艦、Janusよ。提督、今日も頑張っていきましょう。えぇ？あっ、何？私の顔に、なんかついてます？ 
|Introduction/Kai/En = Hi, I'm the J-class destroyer, Janus. Admiral, let's work hard today too. Eh? Ah, what is it? Is there something on my face? 
|Introduction/Kai/Note = 

|Library = J級駆逐艦、私がJanusよ。そうね、Jervisたちと一緒に、本国艦隊や地中海艦隊で、色々のことを頑張ったわ。Franceの艦艇と戦ったことも…あのShingle作戦では、Jervisと一緒に、Anzioの戦いを支援して、そこであれを…Jervisは軽傷だったみたい。不思議っていうか、なんていうか… 
|Library/En = I'm the J-class destroyer, Janus. Yes, I worked hard doing lots of things with Jervis and the others in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. We even fought against a French fleet... During Operation Shingle when Jervis and I were supporting the landings at Anzio, that's when... it looked like Jervis was lightly damaged. Fate is such a fickle mistress... 
|Library/Note = She fought against the Vichy French during the [[wikipedia: Syria–Lebanon_campaign#War_at_sea |Syria-Lebanon Campaign]].
[[Jervis]] light damage meant getting her bow blown off.

|Idle = 提督？何？えぇ、bogey？知らないわ。敵ってこと？外宇宙？練習艦？なんの事？ん、銀河？I know、ここの新型ボマーでしょう？違うの？
|Idle/En = Admiral? What is it? Eh, bogey? I don't know what that is. Do you mean an enemy? Outer space? A training ship? What are you talking about? Hmmm, Ginga? I know that, it's the new type of bomber here right? You don't mean that?
|Idle/Note = Referring to [[wikipedia:Ginga_Hyōryū_Vifam|Ginga Hyouryuu Vifam]] where Janus was the name of the training ship. Bogey was the name of her ship's computer.
