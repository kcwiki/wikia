This particular Type 2 Seaplane Fighter was used by skilled aircrews. A continuation of the seaplane fighter based on the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter and hurried though development and implementation until the new seaplane fighter, "Kyoufuu", could be implemented. Although it was not originally considered for use on ships, the airframe and floats were strengthened for that purpose.
