==Character==
===Appearance===


The "73" is clearly Gambier Bay's hull number. She wears a camo-shirt which appears to be the MS 32 15 A, with the colors consisting of 5-P Light/Dark grey, 5-L Light grey, 5-O Silver, BK Black, while her deck was painted 20-B Deck-blue.  Her other camofloge was the MS 32.

===Personality===
She has a timid, scaredy cat personality, easily terrified in frontlines and especially at night battle. She also has low self-confidence and her sinking line also shows that she is quite pessimistic.



In the fandom she is portryed as having trouble reading maps and having a poor sense of direction in general so She gets lost quite easly. See Danbooru Pool [https://danbooru.donmai.us/pools/13799 "Lost Gambier Bay"].

==Notes==
Requires a total ASW value of 65+ and at least 1 plane with +7 or above ASW value to do OASW.

==Trivia==

*''USS Gambier Bay'' (CVE-73) was the 19th ship of the ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers, laid down and launched in 1943.
*Gambier Bay was sunk by naval gunfire from an unidentified ship (often presumed to be [[Chikuma]] or [[Yamato]]), making her the only US aircraft carrier sunk in surface combat during the war.
*She is probably the second deepest-known wreck, due to the fact she was sunk directly above the Philippine Trench during the Battle in Samar. Just like [[Choukai]] , she probably lies in over 26,000 feet (~8,000 meters) of water, well beyond the reach of manned submersibles. Her Approximate Sinking Location [https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=USS_Gambier_Bay&params=11_46_N_126_09_E_ 11°46′N 126°09′E].
