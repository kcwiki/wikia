==<span style="color:red">WARNING TO ALL PLAYERS</span>==
[[File:Vlcsnap-2018-02-17-21h00m10s258.png|thumb|All Fleet Members of the Striking Force Fleet (Fleet 3) must be Non-Tagged before Entering the Map to enter Node D]]
*When you first enter the Map to go through the first Phase of opening the Hidden Start Point, you will be required to start from Node D in order to reach node Y. This is possible only if you sortie your fleet in the '''Strike Force Fleet (Fleet 3)''' and <span style="color:red">'''All 7 Fleet Members'''</span> are '''NON-TAGGED''', or already have '''Yellow-Tag''' applied. 
*You are also required to bring a certain amount of Nishimura Fleet Members for the shortest route (2 (Easy) / 4 (Normal) / 6 (Hard)), and you must make sure that they are placed in the '''Strike Force Fleet (Fleet 3)''' and are are '''NON-TAGGED''' to avoid locking the historical ships out of their proper route!
**If you have accidentally sent out your original Fleet planned out for reaching node Y into the North Route or another Map due to not following the procedures above, you will have no choice but to use other Non-Tagged Ships to make up a New Strike Force Fleet in Fleet 3.
**Your only other option will be to abandon the opening of the Hidden Start Point and just start from the original Start Point all the way to the Boss.

==Phases==
===Phase 1: Unlock the Second Start Point===
[[File:【KanColle】 Winter 2018 Event E-2 Opening 2nd Start Point|thumb|right|300 px]]
The Map at the beginning has a hidden 2nd Start Point, and you must satisfy the following requirements to open up the Hidden Start Point.
*Obtain A+ Rank Victories on Nodes {{Event/Route|S|blue|X|blue|Y|purple}}, and reach Node {{Event/Route|T|red|}}.
**On Casual difficulty, reaching {{Event/Route|T|red|}} is sufficient.
***Obtaining a Victory in node {{Event/Route|T|red|}} is not required. You only have to reach the Node.

====A+ Rank Victories in Nodes S / X / Y ====
*You must use the Striking Force Fleet (Fleet 3) with 7 Ships
**Route: {{Event/Route|D|blue|G|red|J|blue|M|orange|S|blue|X|blue|Y|purple}}
**You are also required to bring a certain amount of Nishimura Fleet Members for the shortest route, where you require 2 (Easy) / 4 (Normal) / 6 (Hard) respectively. Failing to meet those requirements will make the fleet route to a longer route before reaching the required nodes for the unlock.
**All Fleet Members must be either '''Non-Tagged or already have Yellow Tag''' before entering the Map to start from node D. For those who are doing Easy mode, '''Grey Tag is not allowed either.'''
*The Striking Force is recommended to be composed of the following ships:
**Striking Force - 2 CA 2 CL(T) 3 DD
**Striking Force - 2 BBV 1 CAV 4 DD
**Striking Force - 2 BBV 1 CAV 3 DD 1 SS(V)
*For the air raid node M, having AACI setup on one or more destroyers of your fleet is recommended. Also the use of {{Seaplane Fighter}} to at least achieve Air parity (AP) or higher is advised in order to increase survivability.
*Nodes S, X and Y are night battle nodes.
**For Easy Mode, you only need to obtain A-rank Victory in Node S. Nodes X and Y are not required, so you don't have to continue to X and Y nodes.

====Reaching node T====
*This is done by using either a [[Combat/Combined Fleet|Surface Task Force]] Combined Fleet or a submarine fleet in the '''first fleet'''
*Route:{{Event/Route|A|red|B|blue|C|red|E|red|F|red|I|red|L|blue|N|red|P|blue|Q|blue|R|orange|T|orange}}
**Recommended fleet: 1-6SS(V)
***While this route is '''very''' long, note that only node C and node I have enemies that can potentially harm your submarines; sending your LBAS full of bombers and/or sending node shelling support expedition is recommended to increase survivability.
*Route:{{Event/Route|B|blue|E|red|F|red|I|red|L|blue|P|blue|Q|blue|T|orange}}
**Recommended fleet: 2CVL 2-3BB 2-1CA(V) + 1CL 2DD 3XX
***You will be required to bring (4 (Easy) / 6 (Normal) / 8 (Hard)) Kurita Fleet Members in the Fleet for the Shortest Route.
***'''Hard-Mode Only''': Bringing a Slow-Ship will off-route you from Q to R.

{{Clear}}

===Phase 2: Defeating the Boss===
After having the Secret Node Open, you will now be able to take a shorter route to the Boss Node.
*This is done by using [[Combat/Combined Fleet|Surface Task Force]] Combined Fleet.
*Route:{{Event/Route|L|blue|P|blue|Q|blue|T|orange|U|orange|V|red|W|red|Z|red}}
**Recommended fleet: 2CVL 2-3BB 2-1CA(V) + 1CL 2DD 3XX
***You will be required to bring (4 (Easy) / 6 (Normal) / 8 (Hard)) Kurita Fleet Members in the Fleet for the Shortest Route.
***'''Hard-Mode Only''': Bringing a Slow-Ship will off-route you from Q to R.
***Having AACI setup and enough air power for at least AP or higher in order deal with the air raid nodes is highly recommended.
***Having {{EquipmentLink|Fleet Command Facility}} on your main fleet's flagship will increase considerably your boss node encounter rate due to the fact that there is no LoS check before node Z.
*'''LBAS''':There is only one [[Land Base Aerial Support]] available for sortie.
**10+ range is required in order to reach the boss node Z.
***If you wish to send fighters/interceptors to the boss node you will need [[Type 2 Large Flying Boat]] or [[PBY-5A Catalina]] to increase their flight range and reach it with your base.
