==Character==
===Appearance===
*Oyashio wears a very similar outfit to the first three members of her class; a white shirt with a vest over it. The color palette for her outfit is different from the first three members of her class, and she also does not wear the bike shorts the first three members of her class wear either; instead, her auxiliary guns are strapped to her bare thighs, along with depth charges. Her hair is black and is secured by a hairpiece on the left side of her hair. She sports white gloves and her torpedo tubes are seen on her back. When damaged, it is revealed that she wears a black bra and has black panties.

===Personality===
*Oyashio talks with utmost respect towards her Commander/Admiral and speaks with a formal tone. She has somewhat of a sister complex towards [[Kuroshio]], the third destroyer of her class. She looks forward to her Commander/Admiral's guidance, as shown in her introductory line. She also has a rather interesting need to report just about '''everything''', even the most trivial things like watching the sunset.

==Trivia==
* Name means Parental Tide, named after the Oyashio Current.
** In her JMSDF incarnation, she becomes a submarine twice (as SS-511 and SS-590), and is currently the training submarine of her own class.
* Sunk 8th May 1943 along with the rest of DesDiv15 while on a troop transport run to Kolombangara due to hitting mines leaving her dead in the water then consequently struck by air attacks.
* All members of Destroyer Division 15 (including Kagerou) had all sunk by May 1943 and DesDiv 15 was disbanded by June. This makes it one of the earliest disbandment of a DesDiv during the pacific war. This also makes Des Div 15 the only Des Div to stay a part of the Second Torpedo Squadron until its end.
