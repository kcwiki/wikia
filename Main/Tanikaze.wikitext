==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* She has short black hair with a white hairband.

=== Personality ===
*She speaks like a stereotypical Edokko despite being built in Osaka. Thus, she is the opposite to Ryuujou (who speaks in Kansai-ben but was built in Yokohama, just nearby Tokyo). Also, because of her accent, she has a good relationship with [[Suzukaze]] who shares the same accent, and is sometimes shown spouting Burontisms. According to [[Isokaze]], Tanikaze is a good cook even though she does not look the part, as evidenced in the former's 12pm and 1pm hourly lines.

==Trivia==

*Participated in the Battle of Midway, transport missions to Guadalcanal and evacuation from Guadalcanal.
*Sunk in action, June 9, 1944 in [[wikipedia:Sibutu_Passage|Sibutu Passage]], Tawi-Tawi, Philippines ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Tanikaze_%281940%29&params=05_42_N_120_41_E_ 05°42′N 120°41′E]) by USN Submarine [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Harder_(SS-257) USS Harder]. 114 of the 240 crew members died while 126 were saved by [[Urakaze]]. Sadly Urakaze was torpedoed and sunk with all her hands months later by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Sealion_(SS-315) USS Sealion].

*<span style="position: relative; white-space: nowrap;">Her name means "valley wind".</span>
**It was first carried by the second and last destroyer of the Kawakaze class in 1918. That class is sometimes refered to as the Tanikaze class because the latter was laid down before Kawakaze (even if she was launched and completed after).
