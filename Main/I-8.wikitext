==Character==

===Appearance===
* I-8 wears a school swimsuit with a name tag on it (much like [[I-19]]) along with white thigh-high socks and a peaked cap. She has medium-length blonde hair in low twintails. She also has blue eyes framed with glasses. I-8 also has shapely figure and is revealed to be very well stacked when heavily damaged; in the manga, she uses one of her books to hide her shapely figure.

===Personality===
* I-8 speaks a bit of German and she has a tendency to mix German words in her speech by mistake, right down to referring to herself as "Acht". She is also a bookworm, translated as torpedoes coming out of the books' pages.

==Trivia==
*Calls herself "Hacchan". "Ha" or "Hachi" being a way to read the number 8 in Japanese.
*Her historical counterpart having made a round trip between Japan and Germany, several of her lines are peppered with German.
*Only wartime submarine to make a successful round trip voyage between Japan and Germany, commanded by Shinji Uchino.
*Despite her distinction mentioned above, she gained infamy under a new crew and commander, who committed several war crimes in the latter period of the second world war.
*Sunk off Okinawa, 31 March 1945.
