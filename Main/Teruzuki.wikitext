|Sunk/Note = Teruzuki sank 02:40 AM on the 12th of December, 1942. "That was fast" probably refers to the fact that she sank only 104 days after completion, making her the second-shortest-lived ship available as of August 2015. (The shortest being Takanami)

===Hourly Notifications (Kai)===
{{Template:Shiphourly
| 00JP = 提督、日付が変わりました。今日は私、照月が時刻をお知らせしますね。えへへっ。

| 03EN =030... Ah right. It's night already, but I felt even more tense that I become wide awake. Even though I'm an air defense ship...
| 03Note = This may possibly be referencing the fact that Teruzuki sank in the dead of night in 02:40 AM. The fact that since dogfights usually didn't happen at night time makes her nature to be alert at night rather awkward.
| 04JP = マルヨンマルマルです、提督。少しお休みになりますか？照月が起きているので大丈夫です！
| 04EN =It is 0400, Admiral. Are you going to rest for a bit? Teruzuki will be awake, so it is fine!

| 07Note = As with Akizuki, Teruzuki suffered from supply issues. Mugimeshi is rice cooked with barley mixed in and is known as meal for the poor. [[wikipedia:Takuan|Takuan]], or pickled radish, is also known for being a simple side dish to appear in an average meal.
| 08JP = マルハチマルマルです、提督。さあ、朝の演習から始めましょうか。えっと…編成はっと。

| 10Note = 
| 11JP = ヒトヒトマルマルです、提督。お昼はどうしましょうね？忙しいから戦闘配食でもいいですか？
| 11EN =It is 1100, Admiral. What should we do about lunch? Since  are busy, can we settle with battle ration? 
| 11Note = Teruzuki made her debut at the [[Summer 2015 Event]] where the [[Combat Provisions]] mechanism was also introduced. 
| 12JP = ヒトフタマルマル！はい、お昼です！お昼はかやくご飯のおにぎりです！どう？
| 12EN =1200! Yes, it is lunch! Today's lunch is onigiri made of Kayaku-gohan! How is it? 
| 12Note =[[wikipedia:Takikomi_gohan|Kayakugohan]] is a type of rice that is steam-cooked with vegetables and/or other spices. 
| 13JP = ヒトサンマルマルです、提督！午後は何から始めましょう？やはり防空演習とか？
| 13EN = It is 1300, Admiral! What should we start with for the afternoon? Probably air defense practice?

| 16EN = It is 1600, Admiral! The sunset... It will be nighttime soon. I'm not that fond of the night.
| 16Note = Teruzuki sank at the dead of the night, the irony being her name.
| 17JP = ヒトナナマルマルです、提督！日が落ちますね。夜…か…
| 17EN = It is 1700, Admiral! The sun is setting. Night... huh...
| 17Note = Similar to her 1600 line.
| 18JP = ヒトハチマルマルです、提督！夜ご飯を作らないと！お？外でいいんですか？
| 18EN = It is 1800, Admiral! I need to make dinner! Oh? You are okay with going out?
| 18Note = 
| 19JP = ヒトギュウバルバルです、レイトク。間宮さん、おいしいです！
| 19EN = It is one wine zewo zewo, Adbiwal. Mamiya-san's food is great!

==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* She has mostly the same gear as her elder sister, Akizuki, including her own pair of Chou-10cm-hou-chan. The main differences are her bodysuit (it's sleeveless instead of having merely short sleeves), her skirt (black with white stripe instead of the inverse), her boots (they are fully red instead of being light gray and red), the placement of her Fire Detector (on her chest, holding her neckerchief instead of in her hair), the gear on her thighs (drum magazines for her Chou-10cm-hou-chan) and the expressions of her own Chou-10cm-hou-chan (they both have a closed eye, one of them is biting a bullet as if it was a cigar).
* She has long light brown hair in twin braids with propeller hair ornaments on the tips as well as grey eyes. The combination of black-and-white clothing and light brown hair give her some resemblance to Mutsu.

==Notes==
* [[Summer 2015 Event]] E-7 Clear Reward.
* [[Spring 2016 Event]] E-2 Node F and I drop.
* [[Winter 2017 Event]] E-3 Node J, L, and I drop.
* [[Summer 2017 Event]] E-4 Node L drop.
* [[Fall 2017 Event]] E-3 Node G drop
{{:Akizuki/AACI}}

==Trivia==
*Her name means "Shining Moon"
*Wears same [[wikipedia:Hachimaki|Hachimaki]] as [[Akizuki]], which reads as "61st Destroyer Division".
*She was involved in both the First and Second Naval Battles of Guadalcanal, and assisted both [[Hiei]] and [[Kirishima]] after those were crippled.
*On 11-12 December 1942, she was attacked at night by PT Boats: ''PT-37'' and ''PT-40'' during a transport mission and left dead in the water burning. Three hours later, the fire spread to her depth charges and the resulting explosion sank her. She officially sank on 12 December 1942, less than 6 months after she was completed.
*Her remains lie more than [http://ict.sopac.org/VirLib/TR0280.pdf 500 meters] below sea level.
* With [[Shimakaze]], [[Amatsukaze]], [[Akizuki]], [[Suzutsuki]], and [[Hatsuzuki]] she is one of 6 destroyers with "animated turrets".
* Like [[Akizuki]], [[Suzutsuki]], and [[Hatsuzuki]] she starts with three slots instead of two.
