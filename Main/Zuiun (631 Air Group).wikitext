The 631st Naval Air Group used the [[Zuiun]] as a training aircraft until the arrival of the [[Prototype Seiran|Seiran]] (This is demonstrated by the use of orange paint normally used by aircraft like the [[Prototype Nanzan]], which served as a training plane to aid pilot conversion to the Seiran, and the arrows carried by [[Houshou]] indicating her role as a training ship).
