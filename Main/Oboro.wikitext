==Character==

===Appearance===
*Oboro wears a serafuku shared with the last four members of her class including herself. She has somewhat messy short yellow hair, yellow eyes and a band-aid on her right cheek. She has a pet crab which she named Mr. Crab found hiding in the rear exhaust ports.
*Post-remodel, Oboro's outfit remains somewhat the same, but gains new rigging and larger breasts. Her pet crab is relocated to stanchions on her new rigging. Her main gun post-remodel has a symbol of a crescent moon on it, drawing parallels to her name.

===Personality===
*Oboro has a listless, serious personality in contrast with other members of her class. She doesn't seem to care as to what goes on or what happens next, but will still do her best for the Admiral. Similar to some other ships, she speaks in third person.

==Trivia==
*Sunk in air attack, October 17, 1942, northeast of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiska Kiska Island], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska Alaska] ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Oboro&params=52_17_N_178_08_E_type:event 52°17′N 178°08′E]).
*Her name means "dim moonlight".
**Her name was first carried by the fifth ship of the Ikazuchi class in 1898. The Ikazuchi class ships were the first Torpedo Boat Destroyers of Japan.
*Received her own Kai art on December 8th, 2015.

==Quests==
*Required by Quests [[Quests#A56|A56]], [[Quests#B50|B50]] and [[Quests#B124|B124]].
