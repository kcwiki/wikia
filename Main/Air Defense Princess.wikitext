==Trivia==
*Boss of E-7 in the [[Summer 2015 Event]].
*Nicknamed Kitanda by fans due to her mocking introduction lines. E7 had a 25% chance to off route you at the start of each sortie, which made just getting to the boss node extremely difficult.
*In Summer 2015 E-7, it was possible to gain a damage boost against her by using special mechanics, by destroying the flagships of Node X ([[Harbour Princess]]), Node Y ([[Isolated Island Demon]]) and sinking many [[Transport Ship Wa-Class|Wa-Class Transport ships]]. However, this damage boost was '''reset''' every '''12:00 AM JST'''.
*Returned in [[Fall 2017 Event]] as E-3 Node G Boss with lowered Armor stats.
**Previously she had 273/303/333 Armor for each form respectively.
*Does not perform anti-submarine attacks.
*Although the name of her radar equipment has "Surface" in it, it actually functions as an Air Radar due to having more than 2 {{AA}} stats.
*[https://twitter.com/noratako5/status/932255615195344904 Shown to be capable of AACI], shooting down 5 planes per bomber slot.
