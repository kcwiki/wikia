*In order to get to Boss Node H, you will need to use a fleet of destroyers lead by a light cruiser (i.e., CL + 5 DDs) or a full destroyer fleet. Using any other types of ships will direct you to Node A.
**As of 17 July 2015, Light Cruisers are allowed as flagships for map completion. Previously, they're not. Note that the Light Cruiser must be flag ship or the fleet will be directed to Node A.
**Other than at the start, branching is random.

===Tips===
*All destroyers should be remodeled, equipped with [[Equipment Guide|double attack setup]] and have their stats maxed (with the exception of AA).
* You are recommended to use a K2 Light Cruiser with high stats or strong utility to clear this map, with {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}} being the best [[CL]] you can use for this map. Alternatively, {{ShipLink|Kuma Kai}} and {{ShipLink|Nagara Kai}} are also good for helping clear the map as they have very strong stats at Kai and only a remodel level of 20.
*Line Ahead is the only formation you should be using on this map.
<u>'''Levelling in this map'''</u><br />
*3-2-A is a great place to level up using the following fleet composition:
**'''Flagship:''' whatever ship you want to level up.
**'''If you have a submarine:''' 「CV/CVLx2 (Torpedo Bomber) CLTx1-2 (Type A ''Ko-hyoteki'') SSx1」. Enemies will prioritize attacking your submarine since all of them can attack submarines. You will therefore incur minimum cost to resources, time (Submarines are cheap and quick to repair) and risk while gaining 576 EXP per battle for flagship, 768 EXP for MVP, or 1152 EXP for flagship MVP.
**'''If you do not have a submarine:''' 「CV/CVLx2 (Torpedo Bomber) CLTx1-2 (Type A ''Ko-hyoteki'') BBx1」. CV will take out 4-5 ships while BB takes out the remaining ships. With this composition, you can level 2 DD at the same time. Although not as resource efficient as the first, it's more reasonable if you do not have a submarine that can evade well.
**Having the CV/CVLx2 equipped with at least 1 fighter plane each and going to 3-2-C with double line formation can help rid of problems like having to change the ships out every few times because of low morale and can also lead to additional EXP per sortie. '''However, this is risky and may result in the loss of few buckets. '''
*Visit the [[Tutorial:_Leveling|Leveling Guide]] for more details on recommended formations to use.
