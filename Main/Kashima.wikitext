==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* The colored flags on Kashima's hat are the maritime signal flags for [[File:ICS_Uniform.png|16px|link=]] ''Uniform'' (above), and [[File:ICS_Yankee.png|16px|link=]] ''Yankee'' (below). Taken together in that order, they form the signal flag ''Uniform Yankee'', with the intended message of "I am training; keep clear of me".<ref>https://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/ICOS/Chapter2.pdf, page 89</ref>

=== Personality ===
* Perhaps even more than Katori, she has a highly feminine personality. Her verbal habit is to end most of her lines in "ufufu", which is usually seen as a coquettish laugh.
* Several of her in-game lines also paint her as someone who wistfully longs for peace, a reference to both the fact that she, as a training vessel, isn't much of a warrior and lacks any confidence in her combat ability, and the fact that the historic ship was commissioned during the peace before the war, engaged in essentially no combat the whole duration of the war, and was used as a repatriation vessel after the war before being scrapped in Japan. (Personality-wise, this makes her similar to Inazuma.)
* Her in-game lines portray her as lacking in self-confidence and happiest when cooking or brewing coffee for others. Because of this, she's shown to be the gentle sort compared to Katori's flanderized sadist.

==Notes==
*[[Fall 2015 Event]] E-3 Clear Reward. 
* Does not count as a CL for [[Expedition|expeditions]].
* As a training cruiser, she provides a scaling bonus to experience gain when deployed in [[Exercises (PvP)|PvP]], see [[Experience_and_Rank#Training_Cruiser_Bonus|Experience and Rank]] page for details.

==Trivia==
*Named after the Kashima Shrine in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan.
*Her name literally translates into Deer Island.
*She survived World War 2 and was used to transport POWs, before being scrapped in Nagasaki in between 15 November 1946 and 15 June 1947.
*Even in her newer incarnation in the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force, she is still a training ship, JS Kashima (TV-3508). She replaced her senior and immediate predecessor, JS Katori.
*Kashima's design and other depictions of her taking up side jobs, such as that of being a Lawson shopkeeper, came from the previous collaboration between DMM and Lawson. Her Lawson uniform design is so popular that arts of her in the aformentioned uniform remains popular long after the collaboration had ended. As a result, their collaboration is a recurring event, with Zuihou now taking up the Lawson job as per the 2018 event.
