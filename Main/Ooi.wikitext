==Character==
[[File:Anime oi.png|thumb|200px]]
<!--
=== Appearance ===
-->
===Personality===
* She is infatuated with Kitakami, as expressed in her quotes and in her behavior in derivative media as well as in the anime adaptation.
** In the English dub of the anime, Ooi is much ruder when compared to her original counterpart, such as calling things insects when angered.

==Trivia==
* After being remodeled into [[:Category:Torpedo_Cruisers|torpedo cruisers]], Ooi, [[Kitakami]] & [[Kiso]] can utilize the [[Kouhyouteki]] to attack during the [[Combat#Combat_Stages|opening torpedo phase]].
* She is named after the "'''Ō'''i river" in Shizuoka prefecture, Japan.
** It literally means ''Big Well''.
** Isuzu class destroyer escort JDS Ooi had been commissioned to Maritime Self Defense Force (1961-1992), inheriting the name.
* Torpedoed by [[wikipedia:USS_Flasher_(SS-249)|''USS&nbsp;Flasher'']] 570nmi (1,060 km; 660 mi) south of Hong Kong in the South China Sea at <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion" style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:11.333334922790527px;line-height:17.270835876464844px;">[http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_%C5%8Ci&params=13_12_N_114_52_E_ 13°12′N 114°52′E]</span>, 19 July 1944.
* Along with [[Kitakami]], they were the first ships in the entire game to receive their second remodel on 13/06/2013.
* Ooi loses and gains luck as she progresses to her Kai Ni form, her base starting with 17 luck, dropping down to 10 and ending with 13 on her Kai Ni.

===ID1 Ooi===
[[File:Id1ooi.jpg|thumb|Poster]] Not the Library ID, but the ID that indicates "your XXXth ship". Before the game was even launched, the game announced an automatic delivery of Ooi if you have logged in before the launch. This indicates that you are one of the oldest players, this understandably, is very rare.
