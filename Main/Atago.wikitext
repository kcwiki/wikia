==Character==
=== Appearance ===
*Atago wears a similar outfit to Takao, but with a few differences. Atago wears a blue vest-like garment which is open similar to a jacket, pantyhose and a blue sailor's hat. She has blond hair, green eyes and large breasts.

=== Personality ===
*Atago speaks rather informally and is depicted as a foil to Takao. She is much more energetic than the other ships in her class, and seems to have a special relationship with Takao.
*Like many other ships, Atago has a catchphrase; hers being "ぱんぱかぱーん!" (Pan paka pan!), an expression similar to the English "ta-da!".
[[File:Anime_atago.png|thumb|200px]]

==Trivia==
*Torpedoed by USS Darter, 23 October 1944, in Palawan, Philippines. Maya also sunk in the same area, their wrecks are close together.
*Originally [[Takao]] and Atago's names were reserved for two ships of the Amagi-class Battlecruisers, had the Washington Naval Treaty not been conceived Takao and Atago would be sister ships of [[Akagi]].
*Atago's design was inspired from Myoko's. Among the modification, she received a better armoured hull and the ability to fire torpedoes with a wider angle.
*Her name lives on, along with [[Ashigara]], as the lead ship of the Atago Class Guided Missile Destroyer.
