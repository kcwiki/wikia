This is the improved version of the plane that fought ruthlessly against Zeros during the Great War. The F4F series, called the Wildcat tangled with Zeroes even with its inferior dogfighting capability. With its increased firepower, it can be said that this version is the best in its series.

* The second major production of the F4F Wildcat, this aircraft came with folding wings, allowing carriers to hold 3 extra planes in the same amount of space 2 F4F-3s occupied, nearly a 50% increase in planes carried overall and became the standard for future planes. Although the folding wings and extra guns made it perform worse since it added weight, reduced speed, reduced shooting time and gave it a worse climb rate. Despite being unpopular with the pilots, the development of the Thach Weave defensive tactic made their flying experience much more bearable.
