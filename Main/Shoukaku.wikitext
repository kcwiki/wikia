==Character==
===Appearance===
* Shoukaku wears a shortened miko uniform with arm bracers and thigh boots with propellers protuding from them. Like most archer carriers, she wields a bow and wears a muneate inscribed with the katakana シ (''shi''), the first kana of her name. This refers to her identification symbol in real life.
* Shoukaku has long silver hair with a hairband. Her flight deck is attached to her right arm.

=== '''Personality'''===
*[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary#List_of_Vessels_by_Japanese_Voice_Actresses Seiyu]: [https://myanimelist.net/people/8956/Iori_Nomizu Iori Nomizu] (野水伊織)
*Kind, a good sister, unlike Zuikaku she doesnt seems have problem with Cardiv 1.
*in Fubuki Ganbarimasu manga she was called "ms.misfortune" due to her badluck by Oboro.

==Notes==
* Requires [[Prototype Flight Deck Catapult]] for her Kai Ni remodel.
* Upon reaching level 88, Shoukaku Kai Ni is capable of remodeling into '''Kai Ni A''', which upgrades her into an armored carrier with better overall stats and the ability to use jet-powered and heavy aircraft at the cost of smaller total aircraft capacity.
**Shoukaku Kai Ni A, like her sister Zuikaku, is capable of switching back and forth between her Kai Ni A and Kai Ni forms via remodeling.
**Shoukaku must first be remodeled into Kai Ni in order to unlock the option of remodeling into Kai Ni A. 
**As an armored carrier similar to [[Taihou]], Shoukaku Kai Ni A is capable of launching aircraft during the shelling phase even while in a medium damage state.
**Switching between forms not only requires an expenditure of Ammo and Steel like with normal remodeling, but also requires Development Materials. (15 for from Kai Ni to Kai Ni A, 10 for from Kai Ni A to Kai Ni)
***Modernization losses still apply when remodeling from/into Kai Ni A.
*Shoukaku at her Kai Ni and Kai Ni A forms is the first carrier ingame to have an attack range of Medium instead of Short. 

==Trivia==
*Her name translates to "soaring crane".
*Sunk by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy American] submarine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cavalla_(SS-244) USS ''Cavalla''] on 19 June 1944.
*Taihou was made using Shoukaku's design as a basis. 
**Shoukaku's Kai Ni A remodel - based on the hypothetical scenario of Shoukaku surviving the Battle of the Philippine Sea and receiving upgrades - likely uses this lineage as the basis for Shoukaku's hypothetical conversion into an armored carrier. 
**Coincidentally, both were sunk by submarine attacks.
*Her hair band bears the insignia of the Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service (this same insignia was also used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force and the modern Japanese Air Self Defense Force).
*Shoukaku was considered the fastest carrier in World war 2 alongside with her sister [[Zuikaku]], about 34.5 knots.
