{{Equipment

|en = This mortar was originally developed by the Japanese Army during the latter half of the war for ground engagements. It was also installed on Army ships which had little anti-submarine equipment, and used to project depth charges forward. This equipment is an improved version of the mortar, for use on ships. It can act as a depth charge projector, or be used for ground attack to a limited extent.
