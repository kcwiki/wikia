==Character==

===Appearance===
* Just like another Maestrale-class destroyer, her real-life identification mark "LI" is imprinted on her skirt.

===Personality===

== Notes ==
* [[Summer 2015 Event]] E-5 Clear reward.
* Temporarily made available as a drop in [[4-5|World 4-5]] (reported nodes: I, J, H [http://kancolle-db.net/ship/443.html][http://wikiwiki.jp/kancolle/?%B4%FC%B4%D6%B8%C2%C4%EA%A5%C9%A5%ED%A5%C3%A5%D7%A5%A4%A5%D9%A5%F3%A5%C8#No243]) from October 30, 2015.
* Added as a permanent drop in [[4-5|World 4-5]] as of the January 25, 2017 Update. 
*Enables construction of {{ShipLink|Zara}} in [[Construction|Large Ship Construction]] when set as flagship. 

==Trivia==
===Libeccio CG===
* Her damaged CG that features her missing the aft part of the hull, together with her many complaints about her butt in her lines, are a reference to the fact that in two occasions, the first after an accidental ramming by a merchantman she was escorting, and the second when she was torpedoed and sank by a submarine, she lost her aft section.
* The torpedo like object attached to her thighs are [[wikipedia:Paravane_(weapon)|Paravanes]], a type of towed underwater glider used to snare mines and sever their mooring cables, allowing the mine to float to the surface to be destroyed safely by gunfire. If the mooring cable failed to be severed, the mine would eventually collide with the paravane and detonate.
*Japanese community call her Lolibeccio due to her CG
*Libeccio's Halloween CG shows a Northern Princess's Aircraft being painted into a pumpkin( Known as Zucca Plane). It also appear in 4koma Comic Fubuki, Ganbarimasu! (chapter 105)

===Libeccio as a ship===
* Part of the Regia Marina's Destroyer Division 10 along with sisterships {{ShipLink|Maestrale}}, {{ShipLink|Grecale}} and Scirocco.
* Libeccio's name is based on the south-western wind which predominates in northern Corsica all year round.
* The real Libeccio took part in the Battle of Punta Stilo; she was at anchor during the battle of Taranto, in which she suffered [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libeccio_(cacciatorpediniere)#/media/File:RN_Libeccio_Taranto1.jpg light damage] from a bomb which didn't explode. Alternating between escorting major warships and escorting convoys towards the North African theater, she was accidentally rammed by a merchantmen on the 14 April 1941. She took part in the unsuccessful defense of the Duisburg convoy; while she was engaged in rescue operations, she was spotted and torpedoed by the submarine HMS Upholder, which caused her [http://ilterzonano.altervista.org/ilterzonano/Guerre/XX_secolo/2GM/marina_militare/img/Libeccio.jpg sinking on 9 November 1941].
*It is so far the only overseas ship in game whose name is still being reused on other ships to this day. Submarine HMS Warspite (S103) still exists, but is decomissioned awaiting disposal.
*Her contemporary counterpart is a veteran frigate and training cruiser which has been on active duty since 1983 to this day. [http://www.marina.difesa.it/uominimezzi/navi/Pagine/Libeccio.aspx The official Marina Militare description] states that "she possesses outstanding detecting, charting and neutralizing anti-submarine abilities".
