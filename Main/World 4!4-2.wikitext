===Unlocking the map===
*To unlock World 4-2, you must clear [[World 7/7-1|World 7-1]] in addition to World 4-1.

===Recommended Fleets===
*2 XX 1 CL 3 DD
**Routes differ depending on the Start Point, which is random.
***{{Event/Route|A|red|C|red|L|red}}
***{{Event/Route|B|red|D|red|C|red|L|red}}
**Goes straight to Boss through the shortest route possible, though it will skip {{Event/Route|G|red}} which has a load of {{ShipLink|Transport Ship Wa-Class|text=Enemy Transports}}. Has the possibility of being routed to node {{Event/Route|D|red}} instead, which contains strong enemies which your semi-light fleet might have trouble dealing with.
* 2 CV 1 CVL 1 CL 2 DD
**A more resilient fleet, at the cost of consistency.
***{{Event/Route|A|red|C|red|L|red}}
***{{Event/Route|A|red|C|red|G|red|L|red}}
***{{Event/Route|A|red|E|red|G|red|L|red}}
***{{Event/Route|B|red|D|red|C|red|L|red}}
***{{Event/Route|B|red|D|red|C|red|G|red|L|red}}

**This fleet is capable of doing [[Quests#Bw4|Transports Weekly Quest]] and to some degree, [[Quests#Bw6|World 4 Weekly Quest]], at the same time. However, the routing is inconsistent due to random routing and it is possible that node {{Event/Route|G|red}} might even be skipped. The fleet will always arrive at the Boss Node, but this map is inconsistent and possibly expensive in repairs compared to 4-4 if the goal is to clear [[Quests#Bw6|World 4 Weekly Quest]], due to the possibility of arriving at the boss at 20% ammo and fuel.
* 4 BB(V) 2 DD
**{{Event/Route|A|red|E|red|G|red|L|red}} or {{Event/Route|B|red|D|red|H|red|G|red|L|red}}
**For quest [[Quests#B31|B31]]
