===Seasonal Quotes===
{{ShipSeasonalQuotes}}

==Character==
===Appearance===
*Amagiri wears a white serafuku with gray accents and a matching gray dress, similar to Sagiri. She has dark gray hair done into a somewhat similar hairstyle to [[Ayanami]]'s and wears glasses. Underneath the serafuku, however, she wears a long-sleeved sports bra and track pants; the sleeves of her sports bra can be seen coming out of the sleeves of her shirt.
**When remodeled, her rigging is almost the same as it were pre-remodel, with the exception of an added anchor. When she is heavily damaged, it is revealed that she is rather fit as she sports six pack abs.

===Personality===
*Amagiri is depicted as a foil to [[Sagiri]], being outspoken, extremely lively and active and shows lots of enthusiasm. She shows great faith in her Commander/Admiral and states that they will become a great person one day, and believes in fate, saying that it is interesting.

==Notes==
==Trivia==
*Amagiri is best known in history as the ship that rammed the US Navy motor torpedo boat ''PT-109'' on August 2, 1943, splitting the smaller torpedo boat in half and capsizing it. The PT-109 is notable for its captain, Lieutenant Junior Grade John F. Kennedy, who would become President of the United States nearly two decades later. The captain of the Amagiri at the time of the incident, Lieutenant Commander Kohei Hanami, would later attend Kennedy's Presidential Inauguration in 1961. 
**Said incident has been widely publicized in various forms of media, including a book, a [[wikipedia:PT 109 (movie)|movie]], and a [[wikipedia:PT-109 (song)|hit song by American country singer]] [[wikipedia:Jimmy Dean|Jimmy Dean]]. One verse of said song, "the Jap destroyer in the night, cut the 109 in two", makes reference to Amagiri, which makes her likely the only ever Japanese ship to ever be mentioned in the top ten of the ''Billboard Hot 100'' charts.
*Lost to a mine in the Strait of Makassar in April 1944. 
**Wreck discovered by Captain Vidar Skoglie of MV EMPRESS in 2003.
*Her latest incarnation lives on as an Asagiri class destroyer of the modern JMSDF.
