==Character==
=== Appearance ===
* She has essentially the same gear as her elder sisters, including her own pair of Chou-10cm-hou-chan. She wears the same basic uniform except with slight different tones of grey and a black neckerchief. Under her uniform appears to be a black full-body bodysuit fully covering her arms and legs. She doesn't wear the gloves as her bodysuit also covers her hands. Her fire director is attached to her right wrist.
* She has short brown hair with strands tied to look like horns along with grayish yellow eyes.

=== Personality ===
* Her  hourly lines are rife with talk about eating only barley rice and canned meat, as well as amazement that other foods even exist, making her canonically fall solidly "Feeding the Ducks"  joke.
* She's also known by fandom  as "hatsuduki" (pronounced as Hatsu"ducky" or Hatsu"dookey") due to the pun and romanization of Nihon-shiki of her name .

==Notes==
* [[Winter 2016 Event]] E-2 Clear Reward. 
{{:Akizuki/AACI}}

==Trivia==
* Her name means "First Moon".
* Along with [[Shimakaze]], [[Amatsukaze]], [[Akizuki]],[[Teruzuki]] and [[Suzutsuki]], she is one of 6 destroyers with "animated turrets".
* Like [[Z1]], [[Z3]], [[Amatsukaze]], [[Akizuki]], and [[Teruzuki]], she has 3 slots from the beginning. Other DDs have only 2 slots before remodeling.
* Attached to Ozawa's Northern Force in the Battle of Cape Engano, she covered the rescue of survivors from ''Zuihou'' and ''Zuikaku'' by ''Kuwa'' and ''Wakatsuki ''on the evening of 25 October, 1944. At 1840, they encountered a detachment of Halsey's TF.34 comprising 4 cruisers (USS ''New Orleans, Wichita, Santa Fe'' and ''Mobile'') with at least 9 destroyers. ''Hatsuzuki'' single-handedly faced off against this overwhelming force for the next two hours, eventually exploding and sinking at 2059 (at 20-24 N, 126-20 E). Her sacrifice enabled the escape of ''Isuzu, Wakatsuki'' and ''Kuwa''. The only survivors of her crew were 8 men in a boat with 17 ''Zuikaku'' crewmen who made their way to Luzon by 14 November, having been providentially cast off when ''Hatsuzuki'' got underway to engage the enemy. Adding the survivors from the Zuihou, it would make around 1500 crewmen saved (plus the crew from the rescuing ships). For reference, an Akizuki-class destroyer could hold 300 men aboard.
**In her damaged CG, you can see her look over her shoulder at a little boat. It is possible that is the boat with the 25 survivors in it.
*Wears same [[wikipedia:Hachimaki|Hachimaki]] as [[Akizuki]], which reads as "61st Destroyer Division".
