==UI Enhancements==
<center>[[File:KanColle - New Fleet Changer|425px]]</center>
#"Fleet Setup Presets"
#* You'll be able to save multiple fleet setups as "bookmarks" that you can load at the press of a button.
#* Basically you don't have to change your fleets manually anymore. Just save your own personal fleet profiles for PvP, Orel Cruising, Extra Operations etc. and load them as you need them.
#* You have by default '''three''' slots to save fleet setups in
#** You can get two additional slots by using a [[Shop#Recommended Items|Dock Key]]
#* The "Save Fleet" & "Load Fleet" tabs are located at the bottom-right of the Fleet Composition screen
#Improved Equipment Screen
#*You can now swap/remove equipment via drag & drop. Note that you need to hold the equipment for one second to drag the equipment.

==[[Zuikaku#Second Upgrade|Zuikaku Kai-2]]==
#According to Comptiq Volume June 2015 it is going to be a remodelling that is based on a what-if scenario in which both Shoukaku & Zuikaku survived the Mariana campaign and the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
#'''[[Prototype Flight Deck Catapult]]''' is an item that was obtainable in the [[Summer 2015 Event]] and still is via [[Quest#F21|F21]] and [[Quest#F23|F23]], with a description that says it's required for the Second Remodel of the certain class of standard aircraft carriers. It is required for the second remodel of the Shoukaku-class nameship Shoukaku, and Zuikaku won't be any different.
