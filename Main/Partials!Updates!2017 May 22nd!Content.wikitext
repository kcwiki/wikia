===[[Nagato Kai Ni]]===
{{SeasonalGallery|slideshow=true|Nagato/Kai Ni}}
*{{ShipLink|Nagato/Kai Ni}}
**Requires level 88+
*** Requires a [[blueprint]]
*** Comes with the following Equipment:
**** {{EquipmentLink|41cm Twin Gun Mount}}
**** {{EquipmentLink|Prototype 41cm Triple Gun Mount}}
**** {{EquipmentLink|10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount (Carriage)}}
**** {{EquipmentLink|Anti-torpedo Bulge (Large)}}
***'''Additional Info & Mechanics'''
****Nagato Kai and Kai Ni both have received New Hourly Voicelines, which will only trigger during each hour while she is set as the Secretary Ship (1st Ship of the 1st Main Fleet).
****Although still a Slow BB that's heavily armoured, she has an easier time turning into a fast ship compared to the other battleships. She still requires at least 2 equipment slots though.
****In addition to the original Main Gun fit bonuses, the Nagato-class Kai Ni now possesses unique gun modifiers that allows her to excel during both daytime shelling and night battle.
****Using her and {{ShipLink|Mutsu/Kai}} for the New Quest "Sortie the New First Squadron!" allows you to obtain a New Kanhon Design Anti-torpedo Bulge (Large).
****Apart from their unique equipment modifiers they can now also equip certain items besides BB-exclusive armaments.
***** {{ShipLink|Nagato/Kai Ni}} is capable of equipping [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]], [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft + 11th Tank Regiment]], and [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]].
*****Nagato Kai Ni is also the only battleship capable of using small-caliber main guns normally exclusive to Destroyers.
