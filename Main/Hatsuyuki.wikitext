== Character ==
===Appearance===
* Hatsuyuki has long black hair in a hime cut with blunt bangs and has brown eyes. Like her sisters, she wears a plain white-and-navy-blue serafukuwith a short-sleeved collared shirt, neckerchief, and pleated skirt.
* In her combat gear, she wears her smokestack, bridge, and mast like a backpack, and carries torpedo launchers strapped to both thighs. Her singletwin-cannon turret is carried on a purse-like strap mounted to her wrist. Her loafers are armored as well.
=== Personality ===
* Hatsuyuki has the most distinct personality of the 11th Destroyer Division, as she has a deadpan, listless voice, and a completely lazy personality. She constantly says that she'll "try tomorrow" instead of trying today. She's basically a hikkikomori, and her repair lines imply as much. Combined with her hairstyle, there are similarities drawn to a certain NEET-hime.
==Trivia==
*Her name means "First snow", as in, the first snowfall of the year.
**It was first carried by the twenty-fifth ship of the first Kamikaze class in 1906.
*Built at Maizuru Naval Arsenal.
**Laid down 12 April 1927.
**Launched 29 September 1928.
**Commissioned 30 March 1929.
*Sunk in an air raid 17 July 1943 at [[wikipedia:Buin%2C_Papua_New_Guinea|Buin]], Papua New Guinea (<span style="position: relative; white-space: nowrap;">[http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Hatsuyuki&params=06_50_S_155_47_E_ 06°50′S 155°47′E]).</span>
