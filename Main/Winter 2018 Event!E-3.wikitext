==Phases==
*Unlocking Secret Shortcut Route between nodes {{Event/Route|J|orange}} and {{Event/Route|N|red}} '''(OPTIONAL)'''
*Defeating the {{ShipLink|Aircraft Carrier Princess}}

===Secret Shortcut Unlock===
[[File:【KanColle】 Winter 2018 Event E-3 Opening Hidden Shortcut|thumb|right|300 px]]
*A secret shortcut exists between {{Event/Route|J|orange}} and {{Event/Route|N|red}}.
**Opening this shortcut allows you to skip node K.
*You must achieve the following 3 conditions to open this shortcut:
**'''Reach Node''' {{Event/Route|H|lightblue}}
***Easiest way to do this is to use maximum 3 [[List of submarines by upgraded maximum stats/Sortable|Submarine]] equipped with either one {{Turbine}}{{EquipmentLink|Improved Kanhon Type Turbine|text=Turbine}} (On its [[Reinforcement Expansion]] applied Slot if possible) and 1 or 2 {{Turbine}}{{EquipmentLink|New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler|text=Boiler}}, or outright equipped with {{EquipmentLink|Emergency Repair Personnel}}.
***Route: {{Event/Route|A|red|B|red|D|orange|F|red|G|orange|H|lightblue}}
****The only threat in this part is node {{Event/Route|B|red}} with {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class/Elite|Light Cruiser Tsu-class}} and Enemy Destroyers with Anti-Submarine Equipment.
****You are recommended to send 1 LBAS attack towards Node {{Event/Route|B|red}} with All-Bombers to get rid of the threats.
****All other nodes will consist of Submarine Node and Air Raid Nodes, which cannot do anything towards the Submarine.
****Because of the above,''' '''it's okay to continue<span style="color:red">''' even if one of your submarines becomes heavily damaged on node B'''</span>.
***If you cannot use a Submarine due to lacking one, you must use a Fleet consisting of 1 CL 1 CA 4 DD.
***Route: {{Event/Route|A|red|B|red|C|red|D|orange|F|red|G|orange|H|lightblue}} '''(?)'''
****Using {{ShipLink|Kinu/Kai Ni|text=Kinu}}, {{ShipLink|Aoba}}, and {{ShipLink|Uranami}} in the fleet will skip {{Event/Route|B|red}} and {{Event/Route|C|red}},<br />leading to {{Event/Route|A|red|D|orange|F|red|G|orange|H|lightblue}}.
**'''Reach Node''' {{Event/Route|S|red}}
***This node can be reached easily while you attempt a Boss Kill Run (See the next information about the Boss Kill Phase for Fleet and Routing Information).
**'''Obtain Air Superiority''' (<span style="color:green">'''航空優勢! '''</span>) via LBAS Air Defense from an Enemy Air Raid Attack.
***Required in <span style="color:red"> '''HARD-MODE ONLY!'''</span>

===Defeat the Aircraft Carrier Princess===
*Recommended Fleets [[Combat/Combined Fleet|Carrier Task Force]]:
**2 CV(B) 2 CVL 2 BBV + 1 CL 2 DD 2 CA(V) 1 CLT
**1 CV(B) 3 CVL 2 BBV + 1 CL 2 DD 2 CA(V) 1 CLT
***Please note that if you are doing Normal(?)/Hard mode, you cannot form a Combined Fleet with Ships which have Yellow Tag from E-2.
*Route: {{Event/Route|L|lightblue|J|orange|N|red|Q|orange|S|red|U|red}}
**The Route will be {{Event/Route|L|lightblue|J|orange|K|orange|N|red|Q|orange|S|red|U|red}} if you haven't applied the Shortcut yet.
***You will have to go through this Route the first time you are trying to reach the Boss either way to have the Shortcut opened.
*You must meet the minimum amount of Historicals to skip Node {{Event/Route|P|red}}
**Required Number of Ozawa Fleet Historicals for shortest route:
***Easy: 4
***Medium: 6
***Hard: 8
*Required Air Power: 627+ for Hard Mode
====Special Notes====
*As displayed below, LBAS requires range of 8 to reach the Boss.
**To send Fighters into the Boss Node, you will require {{EquipmentLink|PBY-5A Catalina}} or {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Large Flying Boat}} to increase your range (Please be advised about the Range of your Fighters, as Short-Range Fighters will not reach the Boss Node even with the Two Equipment stated above).
*As stated above, due to the extremely high Air Power Requirement for this Map, you will most likely be needed to make your CVL only equipped with 1 Bomber and 3 Fighter, while your CV(B) may have to deal with the same setup in case you do not have a large quantity of Fighters with high Air Power.
**If even with 2 CV(B) and 2 CVL you cannot gain the required Air Power, you are recommended to either use {{ShipLink|Ise/Kai|text=Ise}} and/or {{ShipLink|Hyuuga/Kai|text=Hyuuga}} to use 1 {{Seaplane Fighter}} Seaplane Fighter each, though this will disable them from using {{RedAmmo}} AP Shells (Unless you give up use of [[Artillery Spotting]] instead by removing your Seaplane, but that is not recommended at all).
*The Anti-Air capabilities of the Enemies in this Map are very high. Please be advised that your Bombers' [[Aircraft Proficiency]] will have go down to 0 in many occasions (even in high capacity slot such as {{ShipLink|Zuikaku/Kai Ni A}}'s 1st Equipment Slot).
**This may also cause CV(L/B) to become disabled from attacking, or lose the ability to use CV Cut-In Attack if Either of Dive/Torpedo Bomber goes down to 0.
**This also means that you should refrain from trying to use any {{Seaplane}} {{EquipmentLink|Zuiun|Prototype Seiran|Zuiun (634 Air Group)|Zuiun Model 12|text=Seaplane Bomber}} on any BBV or CAV you bring to this map.
*As you are going through several nodes which consist of Powerful Enemy Carriers, you are highly recommended to bring 1-2 Anti-Air Cut-In Capable Ships (Ex. {{ShipLink|Akizuki}} and/or {{ShipLink|Hatsuzuki}}, who are also part of the Historicals for this Map)
