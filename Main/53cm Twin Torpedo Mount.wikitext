An old style 53cm twin torpedo launcher mount. Compared to the new model 61cm oxygen torpedoes, the obsolence of the range and firepower can't be denied, but it still sees active use in close-range torpedo combat. It was equipped on the slightly old Kamikaze-class destroyers among others.

* It will also be able to upgrade into another equipment in a future update. [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/953569449453395968]
