|Library/En = First of the Graf Zeppelin-class Carriers, Graf Zeppelin. Capable of undertaking three-dimensional commerce raiding, I am a heavily-armed genuine carrier. It seems that the technology of the Japanese carrier, Akagi, was also referenced in my construction. A Japanese fleet, huh. I'm looking forward to it.
|Library/Note = Germany had sent personnel to Japan in 1935 to inspect the carrier Akagi, using their observations as the basis of Graf Zeppelin's design.

{{Template:Shiphourly
| 00JP = Guten Abend. Admiral、今日の秘書艦はこの私が担当する。任せてもらって…いい。
| 00EN = Guten Abend. Admiral, I will be serving as your Secretary-ship today. Leave it... to me.
| 00Note = 
| 01JP = マルヒトマルマル。これでいいのだろう？任せておけ。問題はないはずだ。
| 01EN = 0100. This is fine, correct? Leave it to me. There should be no issues.
| 01Note = 
| 02JP = マルフタマルマル。うむ、完璧だ。Admiral. Admiral? 何かしてほしいものはないか？秘書艦として、ベストを尽くそう。
| 02EN = 0200. Yes, perfect. Admiral. Admiral? Is there anything you wish me to do? I will do my best as the secretary-ship.
| 02Note = 
| 03JP = マルサンマルマル。そうか！コーヒーだな？任せておけ。最高のコーヒーを味わうがいい。我々はコーヒーの香と味には自信がある。
| 03EN = 0300. Right! You desire coffee? Leave it to me. Be ready to taste the greatest of coffees. I am quite confident when it comes to aroma and flavor of coffee.
| 03Note = 
| 04JP = マルヨンマルマル。どうだ。これが本格ドイツコーヒーだ。あっ、まず先に香を十分味わってだな…。その後… まあいい。飲んでくれ。
| 04EN = 0400. How is it. This is what real German coffee is. Ah! First you should enjoy the aroma thoroughly, and after that... Whatever. Please, go ahead.
| 04Note = 
| 05JP = マルゴーマルマル。もう朝だな、Admiral. シャワーでも浴びてきたらどうだ。ここの執務は私がサポートしておこう。
| 05EN = 0500. It's already morning, Admiral. Why don't you go ahead and take a shower. I will support you with the work here.
| 05Note = 
| 06JP = Guten Morgen. マルロクマルマル。Admiral, 朝食はどうする？簡単なものでよければ、私が用意しよう。
| 06EN = Guten Morgen. 0600. What should we do about breakfast, Admiral? If you are fine with something simple, I will prepare something.
| 06Note = 
| 07JP = マルナナマルマル。Admiral, カイザーロール、チーズとハム、熱いコーヒー… ここに置くぞ。手が空いたら食べてくれ。
| 07EN = 0700. Admiral. I will leave the kaiser roll, cheese, ham and the hot coffee here. Please have some when you are free.
| 07Note = 
| 08JP = マルハチマルマル。さ、仕事にかかろうか。今日の艦隊の運用を始めよう。どうする。まず赤城との演習からか。
| 08EN = 0800. Well, let us get to work. Let's start today's fleet operations. What should we do? Start off by practicing with Akagi?
| 08Note = 
| 09JP = マルキュウマルマル。「赤城」、「加賀」… あれがこの国の第一線正規空母か。カタパルトがついていないな。主砲もないようだが…
| 09EN = 0900. Akagi, Kaga... So that is this country's first-tier standard carriers. They do not have any catapults. They also do not seem to have any guns...
| 09Note = Graf Zeppelin had been designed and fitted with two compressed air catapults for launching aircraft. Contrary to her observation, Akagi and Kaga have a standard array of medium calibre guns, the confusion is likely because of Graf's above-average number of dedicated anti-surface gun array. (hence her capability to engage in night battles)
| 10JP = ヒトマルマルマル。我がMesserschmittに似た機体もあるようだ。あれは艦載機ではないのか？空軍というわけか。何、違う？
| 10EN = 1000. I see aircraft that resemble my Messerschmitt. Are those not carrier aircraft? I guess they are the air force. What, that is not so?
| 10Note = While Japan did operate many airplanes, Imperial Japanese Forces did not have a fully separated branch for the air force, with their aircraft belonging to either the Army or the Navy. Possibly a reference to the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force's Ki-61 Hien which closely resembled the Bf-109.  
| 11JP = ヒトヒトマルマル。そろそろ昼になるな。Admiral、昼食はどうする。何？「マミーヤ」だと？噂は聞いている。ほお？
| 11EN = 1100. It is almost lunchtime. What would you want to do for lunch, Admiral? What? "Mamiya", you say? I have heard the rumors. Hmm...
| 11Note = 
| 12JP = ヒトフタマルマル。ほお？これが「マミーヤ」か。メニューは…豊富だな。Admiral、お勧めは何だ。カレーか。よし、それで。
| 12EN = 1200. Hmm? So this is "Mamiya". The menu... has variety. What do you recommend, Admiral? Curry, you say? Okay, I will take it.
| 12Note = 
| 13JP = ヒトサンマルマル。昼のカレー、かなり印象的な料理だった。ここの艦隊はあれを常に食べているのか。そうか。ふむ…
| 13EN = 1300. The curry from lunch was quite a memorable dish. So the fleet here gets to have that every day, correct? I see. Hmm....
| 13Note = 
| 14JP = ヒトヨンマル… ああ、ビスマルクか。あなたもここに来ていたのだな。私はまだ日が浅い。色々と教えてくれ。ああ… それは、いいかな。
| 14EN = 140... Ah, Bismarck. You were here as well. My time here is still short. Please teach me about things. Ah... That... is okay for now.
| 14Note = 
| 15JP = ヒトゴーマルマル。この国の文化は独特だ。Admiral, 私もなるべく勉強するように心がけよう。あのU-bootのように。
| 15EN = 1500. This country's culture is unique. Admiral, I will keep it in mind to study it as much as my efforts permit. Just like that U-boot.
| 15Note = "U-Boot" is a foreshortening of "Unterseeboot", also known in english as "U-Boat". The ship referred to in this case is U-511. 
| 16JP = ヒトロクマルマル。あれが「翔鶴」、「瑞鶴」か。盛観だな。あれがこの国の空母の「完成型」…というわけか。ふーん…
| 16EN = 1600. So is that "Shoukaku", and "Zuikaku". They are quite the sight. So that is the "apex" of this country's carriers... Hmph...
| 16Note = 
| 17JP = ヒトナナマルマル。日が落ちるな。夕日はどの海にも綺麗なものだ。Admiral, どうした。私の顔に、何か？
| 17EN = 1700. The sun is setting. The setting sun is beautiful in wherever sea you are at. What is wrong, Admiral. Is there something on my face?
| 17Note = 
| 18JP = ヒトハチマルマル。今日は夕食は… あ、私は「正規空母の会」とやらに呼ばれていて… Admiral, 一緒に行くかい？
| 18EN = 1800. Today's dinner is... Ah, I have been invited to a "Standard Carrier Banquet" or the like... Admiral, would you like to join me? 
| 18Note =RIP Bauxite. 
| 19JP = ヒトキュウマルマル。ああ、赤城。夕食会に招待してくれて感謝だ。Danke. それは何だ。「ナベ」だと？不思議な料理だな。
| 19EN = 1900. Ah, Akagi. My gratitude for inviting me to the dinner banquet. Danke. What is that? "Nabe" you say? 
| 19Note = 
| 20JP = フタマルマルマル。「ナベ」… ポトフのようなものか。 なぜ皆でナベを囲む。大鳳、教えてくれ。どうやって食べればいい。
| 20EN = 2000. "Nabe"... Is this similar to a pot-au-feu? Why is everyone surrounding the nabe? Teach me, Taihou. How should I eat it?
| 20Note = 
| 21JP = フタヒトマルマル。不思議な夕食会だった。だが… うん、楽しいものだ。Admiral, この艦隊は… ここはよいところだな。
| 21EN = 2100. That was a strange banquet. But... Yes, it was quite enjoyable. Admiral, this fleet... this place is a good place.
| 21Note = 
| 22JP =  フタフタマルマル。Admiral, すっかり夜も更けたな。さ、そろそろ今日の執務も終わりにしよう。コーヒー、淹れようか？
| 22EN = 2200. Admiral, the night grows deep. Let us start wrapping up today's work. Should I make some coffee?
| 22Note = 
| 23JP = フタサンマルマル。今日は疲れたな。また明日頑張ろう。Gute Nacht.
| 23EN = 2300. Today was quite a day too. Let us work hard tomorrow too. Gute Nacht.
| 23Note =

==Notes==
*Implemented in [[Fall 2015 Event]] on E-4 Boss as a drop.
*[[Spring 2016 Event]] E-6 Boss Drop.
*[[Winter 2016 Event]] E-3 Node L Drop.
*[[Summer 2017 Event]] E-7 Boss Drop.
*Graf Zeppelin is the first aircraft carrier in-game to have a base attack range of Medium. While preceded by both [[Shoukaku]] and [[Zuikaku]] in having said feature, both the latter carriers require remodeling to Kai Ni form to attain said range.
*She is also the first playable aircraft carrier capable of attacking at night. She does not use planes to attack at night, instead performing a shelling attack.
**Can attack at night even at medium damage (cannot attack during day battle if medium damaged).
***Equipping two secondary guns allows her to initiate double attacks during the night battle phase.

==Trivia==
*Named after Graf (aka Count) Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who is best known as the founder of the Zeppelin Airship company. 
*Graf Zeppelin has the distinction of being the only aircraft carrier ever launched by Germany in its entire history. Launched in 1938, she was 85% complete when work on her was suspended due to the Kriegsmarine's shifting priorities in the Atlantic that aimed to improve coastal defenses. Unceremoniously towed between different harbors, the carrier remained incomplete owing to the rapidly changing advances in carrier aviation technology and doctrine that prevented any work on her from progressing, until all work on the Kriegsmarine's surface ships were halted in 1943. She languished in harbor until she was captured by the Soviet Union as a war prize, and sunk in weapons tests off Poland in 1947.  
*Wreck later discovered by the Polish research ship RV St. Barbara in July 2006, 34 miles north of Władysławowo and in more than 260 ft of water.  
*Currently, Graf Zeppelin and Aquila are two shipgirls whose real life counterpart was incomplete.  

===CG===
*According to comment by the illustrator, Graf Zeppelin stores her planes in the form of laser-cut metallic cards in her pouch.  These cards have sections that can be cut away from the card itself, and can combine with other sections to construct a scale model.  When a card is inserted to her flight deck's card slot, her rigging will automate the disassembly and construction process, resulting in an aircraft that is launched out the other end.

|title = Graf Zeppelin's Design
|link01 = https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668509129573400576
|JP01 = 18日のイベントから実装の独航空母艦、グラーフ・ツェッペリンを担当しました。外観周りについてぼちぼち書いてみようと思います
|EN01 = I was in charge of designing the German aircraft carrier ''Graf Zeppelin'' that implemented with the event on the 18th. I think I'll write about her design a bit.
|TL01= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link02=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668509970208460801
|JP02=ノーマル状態は、39年に艦首をアトランティックバウに改修後（進水時は垂直ぽい）、建造中断にならずにそのまま実戦化されたところを想定しています。改では工事再開後に追加されたバルジを艦娘状態でも再現しました。
|EN02 = For her normal version I assumed that after her bow was replaced with an Atlantic bow in 1939 (when she was launched it was kinda perpendicular) her construction wasn't put on hold and she was made combat-ready as she was back then. For her remodelled version I reproduced the bulge that was added to her after construction resumed.
|TL02= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link03=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668511031103131648
|JP03=塗装に関してはなにぶん未成艦であるため、42～3年ごろ、ノルウェーにいたティルピッツと同系統の塗装を施しています。それ以外には、甲板パーツ先端の機銃を、3.7cm SKC/30（ノーマル）から3.7cm flak42（改）に変更しています 
|EN03= Regarding her coating, since she was an incomplete ship I gave her the same coating as Tirpitz who was in Norway around 1942~43. Apart from that the machine guns at front end of her deck change from 3.7cm SKC/30 (normal version) to 3.7cm Flak 42 (remodelled version).
|TL03= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link04=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668511827194572800
|JP04=艦載機は､腰のポーチに金属エッチングカードの状態で格納されています。このカードを甲板エレベーター部裏のカードスロットにセットすると、不思議パワーで組み上がりカタパルト発進後実体化します。
|EN04=Her planes are stored as metal cards inside a waist pouch. By inserting those cards into a slot behind the deck elevator a mysterious power allows them to materialise after being launched by the catapult.
|TL04= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link05=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668512961292447744
|JP05=実物は、カタパルト使用時に機体を乗せる台があるんですが、絵だと小さすぎてわからないので省略してます。　基本的にこれまでの独艦フォーマットを踏襲しつつ、肩から甲板パーツを下げたシルエット、船体を模した靴部分は気持ち日本空母のテイスト
|EN05= The actual ship had a pedestal for planes that were about to use the catapult, but since it would have been too small on the artwork I omitted it. Basically I followed the format I've been using for German ships so far, but at the same time the silhouette of the deck parts on her shoulders as well as the boot parts that were modelled after the ship hull were somewhat inspired by Japanese carriers.
|TL05= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link06=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668513422229635072
|JP06=かかと部分には、実物に搭載されていたらしい、シュナイダープロペラを描いています。
|EN06= For her heels I drew Schneider propellers that the actual ship was equipped with apparently.
|TL06= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link07=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668515423361462272
|JP07=ツェッペリンが実際どこまで赤城の設計を参考にしてるか知識がないのですが、エレベーターの設計がそうらしい、との記述をみました。エレベーターを「艦載機を格納位置から発進位置まで運ぶ機構」とすれば、艦娘においては手がそうなります。二人の手はちょっと似てるのかもしれませんね。
|EN07= While I don't how much of Zeppelin's design is based on Akagi, the former's elevator layout actually is based on the latter, or at least that's what I read. Assuming that the elevator is a mechanism that transports a plane from the storage to its takeoff position, I suppose a ship girl's hands will be like this. Maybe it's those two have similar hands.
|TL07= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link08=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668515789197017088
|JP08=手、というか手相かな 
|EN08= Hands, or perhaps I should say palm reading.
|TL08= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
|link09=https://twitter.com/humikane/status/668683227582730240
|JP09=そういえば、日本空母が弓や符術などファンタジー寄りの要素があるので、ツェッペリンのケープも西洋マジシャンの衣装ぽいテイストとして描きました。入ってる模様はケルト結び
|EN09= Come to think of it, Japanese carriers tend to have fantasy elements like archery or talismans, so I drew Zeppelin's cape like that of a Western magician. The pattern on it is a Celtic knot.
|TL09= [[User:Admiral Mikado|Admiral Mikado]]
