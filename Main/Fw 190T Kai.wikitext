It was the second Standard Airplane of the German Luftwaffe after the BF109 and had the nickname "Würger von Bremen". (Literally "Strangler from Bremen", the homecity of the plane developers) The nickname originated from a small local shrike bird species, which were called "Würger". The FW190 was the best plane the German engineers could come up with during the Deusches Reich era. It was a very versatile, multipurpose air plane. But in the later stages of the war, it was surpassed by the American-made P51 Mustang.

The fairy is holding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_roll Kaiser roll] (a funny shaped German/Austrian bread bun). Buns in this shape were more popular in southern Germany because they originated from Austria. They are probably just a "German thing" the artist wanted to include. There is no known relation between the buns, developers, pilots and the planes whatsoever.
