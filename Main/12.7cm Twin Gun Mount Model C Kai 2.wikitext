*Can be obtained from quest [[Quest#A88|A88]] (choice between 2 rewards), [[Quests#B109|B109]] (choice between 3 rewards) and from quarterly quest [[Quest#Bq5|Bq5]] (choice between 3 rewards).
*Can be upgraded from [[12.7cm Twin Gun Mount Model B Kai 2]] through [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]].

|trivia = This gun is the modified version of the twin gun which was used [[Shiratsuyu]], [[Asashio]] and {{Class|Kagerou}}-Class destroyer. The main difference between the Type B and Type C is that instead of the former's elevation range of −5° to +75°, type C's range is reverted back to +55° of the A's model but with a new -7°; which is required for flat-nosed anti-submarine shell developed during that time (1943). Type C armor, however, was reduced to save weight, but they still prove effective enough to withstand heavy sea and splinter.
