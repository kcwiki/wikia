==Character==

===Appearance===
*Maikaze wears a black vest with a short-sleeved white shirt underneath it, similar to some members of the Kagerou-class. Her rigging is located on her back, and has her anti-aircraft turrets secured to her thighs. She has short yellow hair done up into a small ponytail held in place by a black hair tie, has green eyes and wears brown shoes with black stockings.
===Personality===
*Maikaze is very cheerful compared to other members of her class. As her name includes the kanji for "dance" (even though her name means "whirlwind"), she loves to dance, and will sometimes even ask the Admiral or even [[Nowaki]] to dance with her, with many of her lines reflecting her love for dancing. [https://youtu.be/-aE1-lYwSvw?t=12s In her animations in ''Kancolle Arcade''], she is shown to be very expressive through her body movement, even dancing while she is talking to her Admiral.
**Even if Maikaze is very ecstatic and joyful, that doesn't mean she can't feel sadness. As seen in [[Akagi|Akagi's]] flashback in the beginning of Episode 11 of the [[anime|anime adaptation]], Maikaze notably weeps as she's forced to scuttle her. 

==Trivia==
*Her name means "whirlwind", but is literally read "dancing wind".
*Known for being one of the destroyers who scuttled [[Akagi]] during the Battle of Midway.
*Sunk in action, 17 February 1944.
