==Trivia==
*After May 24 noon, enemy formations were weakened.<ref>June 12, 2013 update notice</ref>
**So far it's the only event that the difficulty was adjusted during the event.
**[[Suisei Model 12A]] were given to those early clearers as a compensation item, before it was available normally.
*A 70% victory rate was needed to participate in this event.
*The first two maps of the event featured high drop rates for [[Tenryuu]] and [[Sendai]] which helped people complete the quests that unlock the third fleet.
*The first three event maps were grayed out once cleared, so you couldn't farm for drops in those maps after clearing them.
