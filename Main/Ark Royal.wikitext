|Library/En = Her Majesty's ship, Ark Royal. I was commissioned as a full fleet carrier.

|00JP = Admiral. そうだ、今日は私が担当しよう。ん、なんだ？まさか、不服なのか？
|00EN = Admiral. That's right, I'll be in charge today. Hmm, what is it? It can't be that you're not happy with that?
|01JP = It’s 1. なに？
|01EN = It’s 1. What?
|02JP = It’s 2. What?まさか、なにか不服があるのか？
|02EN = It's 2. What? You couldn't be unhappy about something?
|03JP = It’s 3. そうか、ならいいんだ。Sorry。疑って悪かった、Admiral。そうか・・・
|03EN = It's 3. I see, that's fine then. Sorry. I'm sorry I doubted you, Admiral. So that was it...
|04JP = It's 4. もうすぐ朝か。紅茶を入れよう。Darjeelingでいいか？よし。
|04EN = It's 4. Almost morning huh. I'll get some black tea. Are you fine with Darjeeling? Alright.
|05JP = おはよう、Admiral. It's 5. 朝は好きではないが、ここの朝は、いいな！
|05EN = Good morning, Admiral. It's 5. I don't really like mornings but, the mornings here are nice!
|06JP = It's 6. Good morning. ・・・艦隊、ソウインオコシ！よし、覚えたぞ。
|06EN = It's 6. Good morning. ...Fleet, all hands assemble! Alright, I remember now.
|07JP = It's 7. Breakfastはtoastにmushrooom, tomatoとbaked beans, hashed brownにblack puddingと・・・卵はどうしたい？
|07EN = It's 7. Breakfast is toast with mushrooms, tomato and baked beans, hashed brown with black pudding and... How would you like your eggs?
|08JP = It's 8. よし、そろそろ艦隊出撃の準備だな？ん・・・お、まて、あれは・・・
|08EN = It's 8. Alright, it's almost time to begin prepartions for the fleet to sortie right? Hmmm... Oh, wait... That's....

|09EN = It's 9. There's big trouble, Admiral! Isn't that a U-boat!? It's dangerous! Fleet, prepare for anti-sub combat! My planes, begin evacuation procedures!
|09Note = Ark Royal is apparently paranoid about submarine attacks given her historical experience.
|10JP = It's 10. 何？違う？伊号？友軍の、伊号潜水艦だというのか？な、なるほど。言われてみれば、違うようだ。そ、そうか・・・
|10EN = It's 10. What? I'm wrong? I-type? It's a friendly I-type submarine you say? I-I see. Now that you tell me, I can see the difference. S-so that's it...
|11JP = It's 11. ちょっと待て、あれはどうなんだ？あれこそ、U・・・何？我が艦隊の呂号潜水艦だっと？なんだと？
|11EN = It's 11. Wait a minute, what about her? Isn't she a U... What? She's a Ro-type from our fleet you say? What?
|11Note = She's most likely talking about Ro-500. While Ro-500 technically is a U-boat, the Admiral most likely bent the truth to avoid any conflict.
|12JP = It is noon. 少々驚きすぎて、お腹が減ってしまったな。いや、大丈夫。こんなときのために、sandwichを持ってきたんだ。Warspiteが作ってくれた。ほら、let's eat!
|12EN = It is noon. I got hungry after being surprised around every corner. No, it's fine. I brought some sandwiches along just for this occasion. Warspite made them. Come on, let's eat!

|14EN = It's 2. Isn't that... Isn't that Bismarck? Did she join us here on this sea too? She's an ally! Oi, Oiii~! Ah, why's she running away!? Wait!
|15JP = It's 3. おいBismarck、なぜ逃げる？仕方ない、Swordfish隊、発艦！やつの足を止めろ！行きなさい！
|15EN = It's 3. Oi Bismarck, why are you running away? I got no choice, Swordfish squadron, take off! Stop her in her tracks! Go!
|15Note = A Swordfish from Ark Royal doomed the Bismarck by torpedoing her astern and crippling her steering gear before she could escape from superior British forces pursuing her.
|16JP = It's 4. 今度は逃げられた。やつめ、随伴艦に直援機を頼むとは、味な真似を・・・まぁ、いい。
|16EN = It's 4. She got away this time. That Bismarck, having her escorts covering her with CAP planes... how clever... Well, I guess it's fine anyway.
|16Note = Historically, Bismarck was without air cover and poorly defended against carrier air attack.
|17JP = It's 5. 夕日か？ここの夕日もいいな。地中海の夕日もそれはきれいなものだが・・・しかし、ここも、きれいだ。

|19EN = It's 7. This is delicious! Souryuu, what dish is this? Is it chicken? Oooh, it's turkey. Oooh... and this is? Curry? Ah, Indian food?
|19Note = IJN's tradition of serving curry actually derives from Royal Navy practice, and Japanese "curry" is doubly remote from traditional Indian food. [[Zuikaku|Someone]] isn't going to like the sound of "turkey"...
|20JP = It's 8. 飛龍、美味しいからって食べ過ぎじゃないのか？お、運動するからこのくらいは問題ない？そうなのか？So great!
|20EN = It's 8. Even if it's delicious, aren't you eating a bit too much, Hiryuu? Oh, you'll be getting some exercise after this so this much is fine? Is that so? That's great!
|21JP = It's 9. 美味しかったけど、少し食べ過ぎた。飛龍、あいつ、すごいな。見習いたくはないが。ああ、あそこ、Italia娘が騒いでるな。少し黙らせておくか？そうか？
|21EN = It's 9. That was delicious, but I ate a bit too much. Hiryuu was amazing. But I'm not going to follow her example. Ah, the Italian girls are making a fuss over there. Shall I go tell them to keep it down? No?

|22EN = It's 10. The Torpedo Squadrons in this fleet are really active at night. They're being hunter-killers huh. What? I'm wrong? Then what are those girls doing?
|23JP = It's 11. Admiral、今日は一日お疲れだった。少し休んでくれ。Good night. Sleep Well.
|23EN = It's 11.You work hard every day, Admiral. Please get some rest. Good night. Sleep well.

===Seasonal Quotes===
{{ShipSeasonalQuotes}}

==Character==
===Appearance===
===Personality===
Ark Royal can be firm and strict, particularly with contact with the Admiral, going as far as actually attacking the Admiral with her own planes. On the other hand, she can be particularly concerning and doting upon marriage.

==Notes==
* Ark Royal is capable of attacking during night battles, provided that she is equipped with any variant of the Swordfish Torpedo Bomber ([[Swordfish]], [[Swordfish Mk.II (Skilled)]] and [[Swordfish Mk.III (Skilled)]]).
** Normal attacks use plane animation.
** Equipping two secondary guns allows her to initiate double attacks, using gun animation.
** In both cases, [[Damage_Calculation#Basic_Attack_Power|night battle formula]] is used for damage:
*** Only equipment stats from Swordfish bombers will be taken into account (secondary guns, other bombers, equipment upgrades, etc. are ignored).
*** [[Aircraft_Proficiency#Critical_Hit|Aircraft proficiency]] (from any bomber) and double attack modifiers are applicable.
** Can't perform night attacks if at medium (orange) damage.

==Trivia==
===In-game===
* On account of being a British ship and also voiced by Shuu Uchida, whose voice acting debut with Kantai Collection highlighted intersentential [[wikipedia:Code-switching|Code Switching]] with [[Warspite]], Ark Royal also codeswitches and has a notably improved English diction. However, due to Uchida being Australian-Japanese, there are parts of British English words that she has some trouble with in terms of reproducing British English.

===Historical Trivia===
* Launched in 1937, ''Ark Royal'' was the first carrier designed with her hangar deck integrated into the main hull structure as a strength deck. Design lessons learned from her construction would be used in future British carrier designs like the ''Illustrious''-class.
* She saw heavy use during her life, from bombing raids in Norway to chaotic convoy escort missions in the Mediterranean. She helped hunt for ''Admiral Graf Spee'' and other German raiders, and took part in the attack on Mers-El-Kebir where she crippled the French battleship ''Dunkerque'' to prevent her use by Vichy forces. 
* She was torpedoed by ''U-81'' in November 1941, and despite determined attempts to save her, she sunk on the 14th. Only one crew member was lost in the sinking. Her sinking was at first blamed on crew negligence, but discovery of her wreck and navy investigations indicated that she succumbed to design flaws, particularly at her boiler systems.
* Her wreck was discovered by an underwater survey company, C & C Technologies, Inc, using a sonar-equipped autonomous underwater vehicle, 30 nautical miles (35 mi; 56 km) from Gibraltar, at about 1000 meters depth in December 2002. The company had been contracted by the BBC as part of a documentary on maritime archaeology related to major battles of the Royal Navy.
* She is best known for her role in crippling the battleship [[Bismarck]], with her aircraft - consisting of old Fairey Swordfish torpedo planes - dealing the debilitating blow to the battleship's rudder that allowed the British Home Fleet to finally sink the German ship.
