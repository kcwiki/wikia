==Special mechanics==
===Difficulty Selection===
{{for|more information about the mechanic|Events#Difficulty Selection}}
Starting from Winter 2015 Event, players can choose from the difficulty they want to play on each event map among three available difficulties: easy (丙), medium (乙), and hard (甲).

Different difficulties yield different rewards with harder ones either giving more items, or better version of the same item. However, ship rewards are always given regardless of difficulty. Drops also differ with some ships available only on medium to hard maps, and drop rates are believed to be better. Enemy compositions also differ with bosses and their escorts are usually weaker on easier difficulties.

Clearing the last map on Hard (甲) mode will reward a First Class Medal.

<div style="width:90%; border:2px solid darkblue; background:lightblue; text-align:left; margin:15px auto 20px;padding:5px;">
;Special note!
:The '''[[Prototype Flight Deck Catapult]]''' item that is a requirement for [[Zuikaku]]/[[Shoukaku]]'s second remodel will drop only on Medium or Hard difficulty settings in Area-E6. '''Even if completing all other maps on Easy, consider completing E6 specifically on Medium with your best fleet in order to obtain this item.'''
:If you have limited resources, check the rewards for a map in advance to decide for yourself what is the most efficient way to get maximum resources while still reserving enough resources to complete Area-E7.</div>

===Shiplocking===
{{for|more information about the mechanic|Events#Ship Locking}}

Ship-locking means that the maps are divided into multiple operations, and ships that you sortie to one operation could not be used on other operations. For example during the [[Summer 2014 Event|2014 Event]], a ship used on AL (E-1 and E-2) cannot be used on MI (E-3 and E-4).

This means that as you go further into the event, you will have less available ships for sortie. This is why it is recommended to have multiple ships properly raised for each ship type, e.g. using your best CAVs on early maps will lock it there, thus you'll have no more CAVs for later maps, which might even be required for branching.

;How to read the table
Each ship is given a color stamp in each area, ships with that color stamp can only sortie to an area of the same color stamp (e.g. blue ships cannot sortie to an orange area). Ships will be marked as soon as you enter the map.
*For E-7, every ship can be used except the ship that you sent to E-5.
*For E-1 and E-2: REMEMBER! E-2 is a [[Combined Fleet]]! Your ships in E-1 can still be used in E-2 just remember to make it a combined fleet!
