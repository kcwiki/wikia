[[File:Anime akatsuki.png|thumb|250px]]

*She and [[Hibiki]] wear navy hats that also bear an anchor emblem.
*She has dark purple hair that is lightly disheveled in a similar manner to her sisters. 
**Another trait shared with her sisters is the matching colour of her eyes and hair.
*Wears a III-pin, indicating that she (and her sisters) are the third sub-class of the Fubuki main class.

==Trivia==
*Sunk on action off Guadalcanal on the Iron Bottom Sound, on the night of November 13, 1942. 
**Her sinking location is possibly identified by RV Petrel in a February 2019 expedition as being between the wrecks of [[Yuudachi]] and [[Takanami]].
*Her name means "dawn".
**The first Akatsuki class was a two vessels Torpedo Boat Destroyer class ordered by Japan in 1897 (simultanously with 1898 Ikazuchi class and 1898 Murakumo class) and completed between 1900 and 1901. 1901 Akatsuki's sister was named Kasumi.
**This makes Akatsuki one of the only two names carried twice by leaders of destroyers class, the other being Kamikaze.
* Although her CG has a [[61cm Quad Torpedo Mount]], she instead starts with a [[61cm Triple Torpedo Mount]].
* In episode 6 of the anime series, she mispronounces "elegant" as "elephant," which is the source of the "elephant lady" meme.
