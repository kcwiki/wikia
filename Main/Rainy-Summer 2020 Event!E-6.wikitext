===Phase 1: Defeating Lycoris Princess===
This part is very straightforward. You just need to defeat the boss at node {{Event/Route|X|Red}} with a Surface Taskforce.<br />


'''Route:''' {{Event/Route|A|Blue|C|Red|G|Red|K|Blue|N|Red|S|Purple|X|Red}}<br />
'''Fleet:''' 2FBB 3CA(V) 1CL + 1CL 1CA 4DD or 2FBB 3CA(V) 1AV + 1CL 1CA 4DD
*Fleet must be fast
*Slow fleets will go through one extra fight at node Q
*Lycoris Princess is an Installation type enemy. Anti-Installation equipment is required to kill her.
*An AACI is recommended for the route and Anti-PT Imp setup for the 2 Imps accompanying the Princess.

===Phase 2: Unlocking the 2nd Boss Node===
Do the following to unlock the 2nd boss node

'''Route:''' {{Event/Route|A|Blue|B|Red|H|Blue|M|Red|P|Red|R|Red|T|Red|V|Red}}

*Ex. Slow CTF: 2FBB 2CV CA(V) 1CL + 2CA 1CL 3DD

*Ex. Slow CTF: FBB 2CV 2CA(V) 1AV + FBB 1CA 1CL 3DD

*Ex. Slow CTF: 2FBB 2CV 2CVL + 1CL 3DD 0-2CA 0-2 CLT
*Must be a''' slow fleet '''or compass will offroute to Node L
*Node M has a New Submarine Princess which you will have to pass on the way to V
**1 base of Toukais to M helps pass rate, and/or heavy OASW in 2nd fleet
*Node V contains a Abyssal combined fleet with Ne-class Kai Summer mode in every difficulty except for Casual
**Bringing one TCI for a finisher is an option, although historical DA is very powerful as well
'''Route:''' {{Event/Route|A|Blue|B|Red|H|Blue|M|Red|L|Red|O|Red}}<br />
'''Fleet:''' CTF with 2FBB 2CV 1CA(V) 1CL + 1CA 1CL 4DD or STF with 2FBB 3CA(V) 1AV + 1CA 1CL 4DD
*{{Event/Route|B|Red}}, {{Event/Route|L|Red}} and {{Event/Route|O|Red}} are Air Defense nodes. Bringing at least one strong AACI is recommended.

'''Phase 2.5:''' Optional unlocking of the Shortcut {{Event/Route|C|Red}} -> {{Event/Route|K|Red}}<br />
Use the same fleets as above and in Phase 1 to reach the different nodes required.

'''C, G & O'''

Slow CTF: 2(F)BB 2CV 2CVL + 1CL 3DD 0-2CA 0-2CLT
<br>
Route: {{Event/Route|A|Blue|C|Red|E|Red|I|Red|G|Red|K|Blue|N|Red|O|Red}}
*C and E are sub nodes
*I, G and O are air raid nodes
*About 550 air power needed on Hard

===Phase 3: Bringing the 2nd Boss to Last Dance===
Again a very straightforward mission. Hit the boss until you get her to Last Dance.<br />
'''Route:''' {{Event/Route|A|Blue|C|Red|K|Blue|N|Red|S|Purple|Z|Red}} with shortcut or {{Event/Route|A|Blue|C|Red|G|Red|K|Blue|N|Red|S|Purple|Z|Red}} without shortcut.<br />
*'''Fleet Option 1'''
**[[Nelson]], 2FBB 3CA(V) 1CL + 1CA 1CL 4DD (Use Touch Attack at boss node)
*'''Fleet Option 2'''
**3(F)BB 3CA(V) + 1CA 1CL 4DD (If you cannot use Touch Attack at boss node)
*Fleet must be Fast. If you bring the touch attack make sure to equip turbine + boiler for fast speed.
*Unlocking the shortcut will avoid the Air Defense node {{Event/Route|G|Red}}, the only node with enemy air power on the route. Thus you are able to obtain AS+ with a single Seaplane Fighter. Without the shortcut try to get at least AP on the Air Defense node.
*Hiei & Kirishima recieve large bonuses on this map and can be considered as BBs for it. However, keep in mind that they also have bonuses on E-7 and you might rather use them for one of the 3 shiplocking tags there.
*The 2nd boss is an Abyssal FBB. You can use regular equipment setups against her.

===Phase 4: Debuff the 2nd Boss===
Only do the following requirements when the Boss is in Last Dance:
{|class="wikitable" style="width:100%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"
|-
! style="width: 100%;" colspan="8" | Unlock Requirements

===Phase 5: Finish the 2nd Boss and clear the map===
'''Route:''' {{Event/Route|A|Blue|C|Red|K|Blue|N|Red|S|Purple|Z|Red}}<br />
*'''Fleet Option 1'''
**[[Nelson]], 2FBB 3CA(V) 1CL + 1CA 1CL 4DD (Use Touch Attack at boss node)
*'''Fleet Option 2'''
**3(F)BB 3CA(V) + 1CA 1CL 4DD (If you cannot use Touch Attack at boss node)
*Fleet must be Fast. If you bring the touch attack make sure to equip turbine + boiler for fast speed.

For last dance, Four [[Destroyer Na-Class Late Model II Elite]] appear and fire four opening torpedo attacks.
Four enemies that can be called Hime ( Battleship Princess and CA Ne-class Kai) attend as a main part of enemy combined fleet, and even if you use Nelson Touch attack, it's not easy to reduce the number of them.
It is highly recommended to use boss support shelling and add double chevron to your LB Attackers. Before opening torpedo phase, if you couldn't exterminate Na Class DDs, you have a slim chance to beat the boss, [[New Southern Battleship Princess]].

Fleet composition and LBAS conposition are same as in Pre-Final state. In your combined fleet escort part, you should put 4 to 5 Historcal-ships that can use the Torpedo Cut-in Attack. If you want to use ships with low luck status, consider using [[Reinforcement Expansion]] and [[Skilled Lookouts]]. Give finish blows to the boss in night battle phase.

===[[Friend Fleet]]s===
[[File:Friend Fleet Usage.png|thumb]]

'''NOTE:''' friend fleets are disabled by default! Please toggle it on before proceeding!

Friend fleet must be manually toggled from the Home port (see the image) in order for it to appear at the boss node. You can request for a stronger friend fleet at the price of 6 flamethrowers; however, the definition of "stronger fleet" is still unknown.
