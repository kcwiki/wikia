===Tips===
*Killing the boss will bring down the map meter 25%. After defeating the boss 3 times, she will turn into her final form in the last battle, for a total of 4 kills. The boss HP gauge does not regenerate.
*2 CV and 1 CVL (no extras) guarantees boss routing.
*The boss will attack submarines, making them useful for tanking when running the map repeatedly.
*Node B and F are Submarine Nodes.
