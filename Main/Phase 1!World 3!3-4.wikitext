*There are no branching rules for this map. All paths are random.
*Bearing a 9 star difficulty compared to 4-4's 8 stars, it is one of the hardest maps to clear. Almost every node past the first nodes contain Flagship BBs and/or Elite BBs. The boss node, however, has a small chance of a fleet without BBs at all.
===Tips===
*'''Recommended compositions''':
**4BB 2CV
**With the implementation of the [[Aircraft Proficiency]] system, a fleet consisting of 4~6 CV and 0~2 BB is also recommended. This fleet focuses on an extremely powerful opening strike and equally strong shelling phase, which most likely will deal high damage. The detailed equipment setup follows:
***5~6 fighters to achieve AS+, one put in each CV's smallest slot. 5 [[Reppuu]] should be enough, but lower quality fighters may require more. Also, using reward/stock equipment fighters which gives less {{AA}} but more {{evasion}} and {{hit}} are also preferred.
***The rest of the slots are filled with torpedo bombers and dive bombers, with the best torpedo bomber on each CV be placed in her largest slot. Recommended planes are [[Ryuusei Kai]] and [[Suisei Model 12A]], but planes acquired from quests and stock equipment of {{ShipLink|Unryuu|Katsuragi|Amagi|text=Unryuu-Class|link_class=Unryuu}} CVs are also good -if not better- replacements.
****The first slot of each CV <b> has to be</b> filled with a torpedo/dive bomber to gain the x1,2 proficiency bonus, twice of that of other slots.
***Saiun may be brought, depending on one's choice.
***It goes without saying that all these planes be at rank [[File:Aircraft Proficiency Gold Chevron.png]]
*Clearing this map with only submarines is possible but requires incredible luck as there are golden CLs equipped with both sonar and depth charges that will hit your subs hard even with turbines equipped. Recommended to use remodeled SS.
