===Tips===
* This map uses the [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=3)]] formula, this means that '''LoS from equipments weights 3 times more''' than usual.
===Possible Fleet compositions===

*** There is a LoS check for E -> J. Using either composition that fails this LoS check will to go to I instead. However, I does not contain any Flagship Kai-grade enemies, so failing this LoS check may be preferable. There is also a LoS check for I -> K. When the [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=3)]] LoS value is between 41 and 43, it guarantees going I and passing the second LoS check.
