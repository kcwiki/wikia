Nonaka Goro was a highly skilled medium bomber pilot and veteran torpedo bomber pilot who could reportedly maneuver wildly in the Type 1 bomber and still strike his targets effectively. Near the end of the war, he was assigned the leader and teacher of the 721st Naval Air Group (nicknamed Thunder Gods) for his experience with land bombers to specialize in ''kamikaze'' delivery strikes with the ''Ohka Model 11''. This was the first time the kamikaze units were used in the war. He was later killed in action by Task Force 58 of the USN.
* He called his squad mates "his family" and was seen as more of a yakuza boss rather than a lieutenant-commander.
* He served a very short time on [[Souryuu]] before permanently moving to land units.
* This version represents his time as a regular bomber pilot and not the kamikaze version.
