|en = This is the carrier-based bomber Suisei, which contains a high-performance, water-cooled engine, and was developed as a successor to the Type 99 Dive Bomber. This Suisei 12 has been specially equipped with the No.31 Photoelectric Bomb for field testing. The bombs on this Suisei contain a photoelectric fuse which reacts to reflected light, causing it to detonate. It is said that the Fuyou Squadron, which stubbornly pressed their frontal attacks until the bitter end, actively used this weapon.
