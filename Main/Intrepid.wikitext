|Library/En = I'm the 5th ship of the Essex-class carriers, Intrepid! That's right, I'm one of the strongest carrier sisters of that war, mass-produced to serve as fleet carriers!

==Character==
===Appearance===
*Like [[Saratoga]], and unlike the majority of the carriers in-game, Intrepid uses a gun: In her case, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1903_Springfield M1903 Springfield Rifle], which was a bolt-action rifle in service with American forces in the Pacific, most notably the United States Marine Corps during the Guadalcanal Campaign until being mostly replaced by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand M1 Garand] for the rest of the war. She carries two five-round stripper clips in her left hand. The rifle's muzzle also expands from her base form in her Kai form.

===Personality===

She is a high-spirited, childish-yet-mature girl. She often mentions the modern equipment she carried in her hourly notifications, which she seems to take pride in. She also refrences ''Area 88, ''a japanese Manga series by Kaoru Shintani.

==Notes==


Even though Intrepid is just a standard carrier, she has more armor than any other playable Armored Carrier in the game, however, her Hitpoint is quite low in comparison to other CV in the game.
She also has the highest Luck stat of all playable Carriers in the Game, reflecting the fact she's the only Carrier to live till this day.

==Trivia==
*Launched on the 26th of April, 1943, and commissioned on the 16th of August as the 4th ship of the ''Essex''-class.
*During the Battle of Leyte Gulf her planes helped sink [[Musashi]] and [[Zuihou]], and possibly [[Zuikaku]]. During the Okinawa invasion, her planes helped sink [[Yahagi]] and possibly damage [[Yamato]].
*She was decommissioned after the war but re-activated in 1952 and modernized as an attack carrier capable of launching jets.
*After being moored for several years in the Philadelphia Navy Shipyards, she was brought to New York City in 1982 to become the floating centerpiece of the ''Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum'', and was later designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.
**This also makes Intrepid the second ship in-game whose real life equivalent is still floating as a museum, with the first being [[Iowa]].
