==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* She wears a bottomless gray, black and red uniform which slightly changes after each remodels based on her historical paintjobs which features a chestplate, thighhighs, detached sleeves as well as a peaked cap.

=== Personality ===
* Normally, she has a dignified personality but artists tend to give her a silly, dorky personality similar to Nagato/Nagamon. She is also given the tag "Big Akatsuki" for these same reasons.

==Notes==
* She received her ''Zwei'' remodel in the [http://pastebin.com/txwvdFfC April 23rd, 2014 update] along with [[Tone]] and [[Chikuma]]'s Kai Ni remodel as the first few ships to require a [[Medal|blueprint]] for their remodel.
* She received ''Drei'' remodel in the September [[Thread:120420|26th, 2014 update]].
** She is the second battleship capable of launching torpedoes (the first being the [[Battleship Re-Class|Re-class battleship]]), and the first battleship on the player side to do so in-game. This includes the ability to use ship-mounted torpedo equipment. 

==Trivia==
* ''Bismarck'' is named after the German chancellor, [[wikipedia:Otto von Bismarck|Otto von Bismarck]].
* Unlike most ships, the Bismarck (name ship only) was always referred to as a 'he' in German documents, at the insistence of his captain, Ernst Lindemann.
* The [[:Category:Bismarck Class|Bismarck class]] was the largest built by the European powers.
** 'Super Dreadnought' described [[wikipedia:Battleship|battleships]] designed during the [[wikipedia:Interwar period|interbellum]] that surpassed the specifications of earlier 'Dreadnought'-type warships. The term fell out of favor as increasingly larger vessels were commissioned.
** Historically, ''Bismarck ''was not equipped with torpedo tubes. Her sister ship, [[wikipedia:German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], had them installed after ''Bismarck ''sank.
* She sank the world's largest battlecruiser, [[wikipedia:HMS Hood (51)|''HMS Hood'' (51)]] in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Denmark_Strait|Battle of the Denmark Strait], the wars' only equal engagement of large battleships (Bismarck and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Prinz_Eugen Prinz Eugen] vs HMS Hood and Prince of Wales).
* She was sunk on her first operation, [[wikipedia:Operation Rheinübung|''Operation Rheinübung'']], on May 27, 1941 in the North Atlantic Ocean ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=German_battleship_Bismarck&params=48_10_N_16_12_W_ 48°10'N 16°12'W]).
** Having sunk Hood it was decided not to chase the damaged Prince of Wales, who had scored hits on Bismarck, severely depleting her fuel load and forcing her to pull out of the operation. 
** [[Swordfish|Fairey Swordfishes]] launched from [[Ark Royal]] eventually scored a torpedo hit on the rudder, jamming it to starboard & ending Bismarck's retreat to [[wikipedia:Brest, France|Brest, France]]. 
** She was finally cornered and engaged by HMS King George V, HMS Rodney and two cruisers, in which she was pounded to an almost unrecognisable state by over 400 hits but remained afloat, finally sinking with assistance from a torpedo strike. 
** Her wreck was discovered in 1989 by [[wikipedia:Robert Ballard|Dr. Robert Ballard]].
** Subsequent expeditions have shown a crew-initiated scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later. <!-- Phrasing is a reflection of the discussion regarding her sinking -->
* Her ''kai'' art is based on her Baltic camouflage applied at [[wikipedia:Kiel_Bay|Kiel Bay]]. Her ''zwei'' art represents her repainting before departing Norway to the Atlantic Ocean during ''[[wikipedia:Operation Rheinübung|Operation Rheinübung]]''.
* '改' means 'remodelled' (for the first time), '改二' means 'remodelled a second time', etcetera. However, German ships use ''zwei'' (two) & ''drei'' (three) for '改二' & '改三', respectively, omitting the '改'.
