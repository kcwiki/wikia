*She can be described as a laid-back girl who is constantly busy making battle preparations. She also has a tendency to emphasize her speeches with {{nihongo|"Seriously!"|もち！|Mochi!}}

==Trivia==
*Fujinami was one of several destroyers present at the Battle of Samar on October 25, 1944, where she rescued the crew of [[Choukai]] before scuttling the stricken heavy cruiser with a torpedo attack. She would ultimately be lost with all hands, including Choukai's survivors, two days later while attempting to assist the destroyer [[Hayashimo]] from an air attack by the USS Essex.
