===Naval District [[Mackerel|Saury &amp; Sardine]] Festival===
*The Saury Festival has returned for 2019, but in a slightly different form - this year, one can fish for both Saury and Sardines.
*Saury
**Can be found in areas near the naval base and in northern waters.
**Equipment that can be used to increase saury catches include:
***A strong light source that illuminates the sea and spots schools of fish ({{EquipmentLink|Searchlight}}).
***Equipment that can detect fish under the water ({{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|text=Active Sonars}}).
***Aircraft that can spot saury from the sky ({{EquipmentLink|Type 0 Reconnaissance Seaplane|text=Seaplanes}}).
**After collecting enough saury, they can be cooked into the following dishes:
***Sashimi: For resources
***Grilled: For materials
***Kabayaki: For producing {{EquipmentLink|Canned Saury}}
*Sardines
**Can be found in areas near the naval base.
**Equipment that can be used to increase sardine catches include:
***Equipment that can detect fish under the water ({{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Active Sonar|text=Active Sonars}}).
***Slow seaplanes that can support sardine fishing through use of nets ({{EquipmentLink|Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane|text=Ro.43?}}).
**Sortieing multiple [[DE|Coastal Defense Ships]] with your fishing fleet can also improve sardine catches.
**After collecting enough sardines, they can be cooked into the following dishes:
***Sardine Sashimi
***Sardine Balls
***Sardine Sushi
*The overfishing mechanic applies to both saury and sardines like in previous saury events. One can avoid overfishing by:
**Refraining from using [[List_of_Anti-Submarine_Equipment_by_stats#Depth_Charges|depth charges]] while fishing.
**Not fishing within the same map for too long.
*This event comes with 5 related quests:
