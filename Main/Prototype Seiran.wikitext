*This is the first equipment that have to have the ( 試製 lit: Prototype ) designation in their name, with the stats far beyond that of conventional equipment.
*The Seiran was designed as a submarine-carried seaplane bomber for use against the Panama Canal to disrupt US Navy logistical capability between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Seiran never saw any action however due to Japan's surrender, and most of them were destroyed at the end of the war to protect the IJN's secrets.
