{{Equipment

|en = The prototype Type 4 Rocket was developed by the Japanese Army as a surface-to-surface weapon. It was designed to suppress and destroy enemy ground forces and encampments using a concentrated projection of overwhelming force, and also saw use in defensive engagements. This is a hypothetical shipborne version of that weapon, to be installed in high densities on ships to strike enemy ground forces. *This equipment will display improved performance when used in high concentrations.

|trivia = Although introduced late in the war, Japanese development in rocket technology was rapidly advancing with the assistance of German experiments and rocket designs influencing developments. First evidence of clear influence was in the rockets themselves featuring spin-stabilizers that greatly increased accuracy instead of the previous fin stabilizers. The Army also developed a more proper launching mechanism, a crude tube that improved the rocket's initial accuracy and direction instead of the Navy's frame ramp version. Although it looked visually like a mortar, rockets had to be loaded from the side by opening the hatch and it also used typical mortar equipment like a bipod and base plate. It was also found to be pretty accurate even among conventional mortars, consisting hitting the same 100 yard area from 3000 yards away enough to start fires. It was deployed in 1943 successfully during the Battle of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and was being prepared to be used in the defense of the home islands.
*The rockets themselves could actually be launched from almost anything, including makeshift ramps, hollowed out wood cylinders, pipes, gutters and slopes on the ground.
*The infighting between the IJN and IJA was getting so ridiculous, both developed pretty much the same rocket for double the cost. Only the IJA rocket was slightly longer for better range.
*The rocket launcher required a crew of 10 men to operate.
*It was considered a heavy mortar type by the IJA.
*The base plate in the card art is positioned backwards just like it appears in a few historical pictures.
