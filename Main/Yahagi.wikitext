|Introduction = 軽巡矢矧、着任したわ。提督、最後まで頑張っていきましょう！
|Introduction/En = Light Cruiser Yahagi, reporting for duty. Let's work at it together to the end, Admiral!

|Library = 阿賀野型軽巡の三番艦、矢矧よ。<br>マリアナ、レイテ、坊ノ岬と、後半の大きな海戦には殆ど参加したわ。<br>そうよ、最後の最後まで暴れてみせたの。私の記憶の途切れた後、大和はどうなったのかしら。<br>ま、いいわ…今度は全てを護りきるから！
|Library/En = Yahagi, the third ship of the Agano-class light cruisers.<br>I've participated in most of the major sea battles during the latter part of the war, including the Mariana Straits, Leyte Gulf, and Bonomisaki.<br>That's right, I fought it out to the very end. I wonder what happened to Yamato, after my memories trailed off.<br>Oh well... This time, I'm going to protect everything!
|Library/Note = Yahagi, along with her sisters, were launched well into the war. On her final mission, she escorted [[Yamato]] on the way to Okinawa.

|Idle = そうね。この次の人生がもしあるのなら、今度は軍艦じゃないってのもいいかもね。

|Secretary Married/En = Admiral… The fleet girls are complimenting you for your hard work, you know? ...he isn't listening...

|Secretary Married/Kai/En = Admiral, what the matter? You looked reddish. Taking care of yourself is important, you know. Hmm... You had slight fever. Right, I'll make you something nutritious. I'm off using Mamiya's kitchen for a while. Wait for me, okay?

|Wedding = 何っ、提督、あなた…どうしたの？そんな顔で……なんか真剣な表情ね。…えっ、これ、私に？大和とか、雪風とかじゃなくって？わ、私に！？…っ、どうしよう…あ、あの…どうしよう…わ、私……っ
|Wedding/En = Wha-, Admiral, you.. What's wrong? Your face... you have a rather serious expression. ...Eh, this is for me? Not for someone like Yamato or Yukikaze? For me!? W-what should I do... hu-hum.... What should I do..I-I...

==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
*Yahagi has a slightly laid-back but determined personality. She speaks rather informally (but not as informally as [[Agano]]) but is serious when required. She seems to be rather ticklish as she starts to giggle when poked too many times.

==Trivia==
*Named after Yahagi river in Chubu region.
*Her remodeled version is the one of the few kanmusu to have a sakura holographic background. The others are [[Yamato]], [[Musashi]], and [[Hiryuu|Hiryuu Kai Ni]].
**That name was first carried by the second protected cruiser of the Chikuma class in 1912.
*Takekuni Ikeda, 90 at the time of the interview in January 2014, is a war veteran who once served as a crew of the Yahagi in WWII. After being presented with the picture of Yahagi's KanColle counterpart, he gave a comment that [http://sgcafe.com/2014/01/original-battleship-yahagi-crew-member-meets-ships-kantai-collection-counterpart/ she is cute and looks like a good girl].
*Sunk on April 7 1945, by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USN USN] [[wikipedia:Fast_Carrier_Task_Force|Task Force 58]] aircraft south of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB Kyūshū] <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion" style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:sans-serif;font-size:11.333334922790527px;line-height:17.270835876464844px;"><span style="white-space:nowrap;">[http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Yahagi_%281942%29&params=30_47_N_128_08_E_ <span class="geo-default" style="display:inline;"><span class="geo-dms" style="display:inline;" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude" style="white-space:nowrap;">30°47′N</span> <span class="longitude" style="white-space:nowrap;">128°08′E</span></span></span>]</span></span>, while she was taking part of [[wikipedia:Operation_Ten-Go|Operation Ten-Go]] as the flagship of DesRon 2. She was hit by 12 bombs and 7 torpedoes. TBM Avengers from VT-10, based on [[Intrepid]], were among those who took credit for sinking her.
**Isokaze tried to rescue Yahagi's survivors, this made Isokaze the target of air attacks.
