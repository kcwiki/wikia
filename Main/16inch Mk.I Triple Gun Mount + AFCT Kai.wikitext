|en = The Nelson-class was a class of super-dreadnoughts that were built with 16 inch guns in the land of black tea as part of the Big Seven under the naval treaty. These large-caliber triple battleship guns were used as their main armament and carried entirely in the front. Their shelling accuracy has been increased by improving the Admiralty Fire Control Table, their latest analogue computer fire-control system. Using them on ships like the Nelson-class should allow them to demonstrate their high combat efficiency.
