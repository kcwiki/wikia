===Instructions for Beginners===

Welcome to your first Sortie Beginner Admirals!

Although you may try to sortie with your Starter Ship alone, she will be too scared to face multiple enemies alone!

Try to make her some new friends through [[Construction]], and construct some new Destroyers via 30 {{Fuel}} / 30 {{Ammo}} / 30 {{Steel}} / 30 {{Bauxite}} Recipe! ('''Don't try to craft any BIG Ships for now...''' You will get there later when you progress through the game.)

You should try to bring at least 3 Ships as a start. Please note that the Compass Fairy may route you randomly to Node {{Event/Route|B|red}}, but just try again until the Compass takes you to the Boss.

===Sample Fleet for Beginners===

===Ship Sparkling===

World 1-1 is perfect for Sparkling Ships for [[Expedition]] to obtain Great Success or Battles. Please read [[Morale/Fatigue]] Page for more information if you are not familiar of the effects of Sparkling Ships.
