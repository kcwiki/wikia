Radars during WW2 were a recent innovation that greatly aided/changed naval warfare. It allowed surface ships to detect aircraft, far-away objects, and more importantly, enemy ships.

There are three types of radars in the game: small, large, and large (II). If a radar has 2+ AA, it is considered an air radar. If a radar has 5+ LoS, it is considered a surface radar. A radar can act both as an air and as a surface if both conditions are met.

With certain set-ups, Air Radars can trigger Anti-Air defense during the Air Phase as well as increasing the trigger rate of Anti-Air Cut-ins.
