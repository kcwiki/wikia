==Character==
===Appearance===
*Murasame wears a black serafuku shared with the first four ship girls of her class, including herself. She has long brown hair in twintails with a slight ahoge and orange-brown eyes. While not very obvious in her normal CG, some seasonal CG of her reveals that she has rather large breasts.
*On her first remodel, she gains an anchor like [[Mutsu]]'s, new hand-held cannons, black bows like [[Yuudachi]]'s securing her twintails in place and slightly updated rigging.
*On her second remodel, her outfit changes entirely; this time, her outfit is somewhat based on the outfit she wore pre-second remodel, although there are some very major differences between said outfits. Her anchor also becomes noticeably longer with the chain being wrapped around her left arm.
**A rather hard-to-notice trait is that Murasame's eyes also are of different colors after her second remodel; her left eye remains brown while her right eye becomes red à la Yuudachi.

===Personality===
*Murasame is high-spirited, easygoing and speaks very casually, probably even more so than [[Yuudachi]] or [[Shiratsuyu]]. She is the only Shiratsuyu-class destroyer to sometimes integrate short English phrases (albeit poor) into her dialogue, as seen in her construction, supply and some of her secretary lines. She is usually looked up to by [[Harusame]] as a big sister figure.
*She, like some other kanmusu, has a catchphrase, with hers being "はいはーい!" (Yes, yes!).

==Notes==
*Murasame Kai Ni is able to equip [[:Category:Landing_Craft|Landing Craft]] and [[:Category:Command_Facilities|Command Facilities]].

==Trivia==
*Sunk in March 5 1943 in the {{wikipedia|Battle of Blackett Strait}} ({{geo|08°03′S 157°13′E|for_page=true|pagename=Japanese destroyer Murasame (1935)}}). Her wreck is near to the Kolombangara Island.
*Her name literally means "village rain", and is used for general occurrence of rainy shower, such as "passing shower" and "forest shower".
**It was first carried by the second Torpedo Boat Destroyer of the Harusame class in 1903.
**Predecessor of the existing JMSDF Ships along with the ships names from [[:Category:Shiratsuyu Class|Shiratsuyu class]] and [[:Category:Akatsuki Class|Akatsuki class]] (except [[Hibiki]]) in present currently active in the Maritime Navy.
