This map contains 1 TP bar and 2 HP bars that must be depleted in order to complete the map.
*Phase 1: Deplete the TP bar by securing multiple A or S ranks at Node I
*Phase 2: Deplete the first HP bar by damaging (then sinking) the [[Supply Depot Princess B]] at Node J
*Phase 3: Open the shortcut Q-T
*Phase 4: Deplete the last HP bar by damaging (then sinking) the [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] at Node T.
2 LBAS is available for you to sortie (Airbase defence can also occur)
===Phase 1: Transport Operation===
Transport Combined Fleet '''1CAV 1CL/CAV 4DD + 1CL 2CA(V) 3DD'''<br />
Transport Combined Fleet '''1CVE 1AV/CAV 4DD + 1CL 2CA(V) 3DD'''
*Routes {{Event/Route|B|blue|A|red|D|red|F|black|H|green|I|red}}
*As this is a Transport Operation, you are recommended to bring as many Drum Canisters and Daihatsu Landing Craft as possible
*LBAS: 1 Base of ASW bombers to Node D , another base of all bombers to Boss Node
'''E -> J''' route will be revealed once this phase is over
====Phase 1 Boss post-clear farming====
On Hard mode, once this phase is over, you can alway go back to this boss node to farm a lot of DE such as [[Sado]], [[Tsushima]] and [[Maruyu]]. A '''single fleet such as 1CVL 2CLT 1CL 1CL/(F)BB(V) 1AV''' should be strong enough to S rank the boss node reliably (Routes {{Event/Route|A|red|D|red|F|black|H|green|I|red}})
===Phase 2: Defeating Supply Depot Princess B===
Single Fleet '''1CA 1CL 4DD''' (Not CAV)
*Routes {{Event/Route|A|red|D|red|G|orange|J|red}}
*This comp goes through [[New Submarine Princess]] node and an air raid node. Consider OASW and AACI if you have trouble bypassing
*There are PT Imp Packs at the boss node, a certain equipment such as {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Lookouts}} may be required to counter them
*LBAS: 1 Base of ASW bombers to Node D , another base of all bombers to Boss Node
**If node A forces retreats a lot, consider sending LBAS of all bombers to this node instead
===Phase 3: Opening the shortcut===

*<u>1. Single fleet</u>

**'''S rank node J''': Same comp as Phase 2
**'''AS node G''':
***Not required for Easy.
***Heavy comp '''1BB 2CAV 3CV(B)''', '''2 BB 4 CV(B)'''
****Route {{Event/Route|A|red|D|red|E|red|G|orange|}}
****This comp will go through both [[New Submarine Princess]] and CA Ne-Class Kai node. LBAS can be sent to these two nodes to increase the passing rate
****Node G has one formation that requires 550+ air for AS. It's recommended to bring 600 air or more to counter it
***Light comp '''1CA 1CL 4DD (Same as Phase 2, with CL being {{ShipLink|Yura/Kai Ni}} and CA being {{ShipLink|Zara/Due}})'''
****Route {{Event/Route|A|red|D|red|G|orange|}}
****Skipping CA Ne-Class Kai node, requires several Seaplane Fighters to gain AS at node G (May have issue with the comp that requires 550+ air, but LBAS can be sent here to fighter sweep and lower the air down)
*<u>2. Carrier Task Force</u>

**'''AS node C''': '''2BBV 4CV(B) + 1CL 2DD 3XX'''
***Not required for Easy.
***Route {{Event/Route|C|red|}}
**'''AS node O''': '''1FBB 2CAV 2CV Akitsushima Kai / Akashi Kai + 1CL 2CA 3DD (All Fast)'''
** Can be combined with requirement to S rank node R below
***Route {{Event/Route|B|blue|D|red|K|blue|L|red|M|black|O|red|}}
***Node O has one formation that requires 900+ air for AS. It's recommend to bring around 750 air and use one of the LBAS to fighter sweep this node, lowering it's air power for easier AS
***Using a Fleet Command Facility helps with Node L
*<u>3. Transport Combined Fleet</u>

**'''S rank node D and I''': Same comp as Phase 1
***There is an alternative way of doing the Node D requirement via Carrier Task Force, with a fleet of '''2 CVL (1st Fleet) + 1 CL 5 DD (2nd Fleet) (FAST FLEET)'''. Route: {{Event/Route|B|blue|D|red}}
***Single fleet used for farming can also be used to finish both requirements in one run
*<u>4. Either Surface Task Force or Carrier Task Force</u>

**'''S rank node R''':
***CTF Route {{Event/Route|B|blue|D|red|K|blue|L|red|M|black|O|red|P|blue|Q|red|R|red}}
****'''1FBB 2CV 2CAV Akitsushima Kai / Akashi Kai + 1CL 2CA(V) 3DD (All Fast)'''
***STF Route {{Event/Route|B|blue|A|red|D|red|K|blue|L|red|M|black|O|red|P|blue|Q|red|R|red}}
***Either combined fleet will work. Using CTF will skip node A, but escort fleet might cause issue pre-boss and get more retreat. On the other hand, STF can fight the pre-boss nodes better, but have to go through the extra node A
*<u>5. '''Score AS during the airbase defence'''</u>

**Not required for Easy.
**Due to the presence of [[Abyssal Sky Fortress Ace (Heavy Bomber Model)]], it's recommended to equip multiple high attitude interceptors such as {{EquipmentLink|Shuusui}} to be able to gain AS

===Phase 4: Defeating Aircraft Carrier Princess===
Carrier Task Force '''2(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 1CA(V)/CL Akitsushima Kai / Akashi Kai + 1CL 2DD 3CLT/CA(V) (All Fast)'''
*Routes {{Event/Route|B|blue|D|red|K|blue|L|red|M|black|O|orange|P|blue|Q|red|T|red}}
*On Hard mode, boss node has very high air power. You may need 700 air or more to be able to score AS there
*M node is the anchorage repair node
*L node contains a lot of PT Imp Pack, a certain equipment such as {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Lookouts}} may be required to counter them
*LBAS: 1 Base of ASW bombers to Node D , another base of all bombers or fighter sweep to the boss node
Carrier Task Force '''2(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 2CA(V)/CL + 1CL 2DD 3CLT/CA(V) (All Fast)'''
*Routes {{Event/Route|B|blue|D|red|K|blue|L|red|N|orange|O|orange|P|blue|Q|red|T|red}}
*Same idea as the above comp, but will go through one more air raid node, skipping the anchorage repair node completely
Surface Task Force '''3(F)BB(V) 1CV(B) 1CA(V) (Akitsushima Kai or Akashi Kai) + 1CL 2DD 3CA(V)/CLT'''
*Routes {{Event/Route|B|blue|A|red|D|red|K|blue|L|red|M|black|O|orange|P|blue|Q|red|T|red}}
*Going through one more surface node which will cause ammo penalty at the boss node, in exchange you can bring slow ships
*As you will arrive at the boss node with 36% ammo left, AO with [[Underway Replenishment]] can be considered for the Final Kill to restore the damage modifier back to 100%

===[[Friend Fleet]]s===
[[File:Friend Fleet Usage.png|thumb]]

'''NOTE:''' friend fleets are disabled by default! Please toggle it on before proceeding!

Friend fleet must be manually toggled from the Home port (see the image) in order for it to appear at the boss node. You can request for a stronger friend fleet at the price of 6 flamethrowers; however, the definition of "stronger fleet" is still unknown.
