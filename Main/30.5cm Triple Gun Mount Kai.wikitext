A battleship main battery from a northern country.<br>
As far as battleship main guns are concerned its scale was considered behind the times during the age of superdreadnoughts, but nevertheless it was mounted as triple-barrelled main battery on at the time modern dreadnoughts. This armament is an improved version of said gun that was modified for the modernised and remodelled battleship from the country up north.
