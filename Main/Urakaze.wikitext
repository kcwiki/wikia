==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* Urakaze, wears a white and blue button-up serafuku with a yellow neckerchief (similar to Yukikaze) and rolled up sleeves on top of a Kagerou-class standard pleated skirt with simple white socks under everything. On her back is her rigging which she wears sideways. Unlike most of the Kagerou-class, she wears elbow gloves. She wields two pistol-like guns, one resembles the standard 12.7 cm twin gun, the other resembles an Anti-Air gun.
* She has medium-length blue hair with twin buns topped with a sailor hat, and blue eyes.
* Similarly to Hamakaze, she is noted to have unusually large breasts for her ship class.

=== Personality ===
*Urakaze speaks in the Hiroshima dialect. She is very friendly with her Admiral/Commander and is always helping them with their work; in battle, however, she is one of the more aggressive members of the Kagerou-class destroyers. In some of her seasonal lines, it is revealed that she is very good at cooking, and she even helps [[Isokaze]] in cooking dinner for the Admiral as mentioned in the latter's 6pm hourly line, due to Isokaze's terrible cooking.

==Trivia==
*Sunk by ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Sealion_%28SS-315%29 USS Sealion]'' 65 miles (120 km) north-northwest of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelung Keelung], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan Formosa] (<span style="position: relative; white-space: nowrap;">[http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Urakaze&params=26_09_N_121_23_E_ 26°09′N 121°23′E]</span>), on 21 November 1944. She sank with all hands.
*She was hit on her magazine by one of 3 torpedoes that were fired against Nagato. Nagato avoided them after noticing the 3 torpedo hits that subsequently sank Kongou.
*Her name means "sea breeze" or "sea wind".
**Her name was first carried by a 1915 two-destroyer class leader. Urakaze was the only Urakaze class ship to serve Japan in 1915, her sister (Kawakaze) being sold before completion.
