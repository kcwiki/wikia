==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
*Jervis is a cheerful and enthusiastic girl.

==Notes==
*Jervis Kai is capable of performing [[Partials/Opening ASW|OASW]] attacks, regardless of her ASW stat. 

==Trivia==
*Launched in September 1938, HMS Jervis was designed as the flotilla leader for the J-class destroyers, and saw action throughout all of WW2.
*She is jointly (with Orion and Nubian) one of the most decorated ships for Battle Honours in the Royal Navy, second only to [[Warspite]]. She was seen as a lucky ship, as despite all the action she saw she never lost a crew member in the whole war to enemy action. Her sister Kelly, leader of the K-class, meanwhile was very much an unlucky ship.
*She spent much of her career in the Mediterranean, escorting convoys and attacking land targets, as well as attacking several Italian convoys. She was present at the Battle of Cape Matapan where she assisted in the sinking of [[Zara]], and finished off [[Pola]] after taking off her remaining crew. She also took part in the D-Day landings.
*Post-war she helped police the Italian waters, before being used as an explosives test ship and then scrapped in 1949.
