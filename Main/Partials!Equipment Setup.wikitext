There is no "Equipment Setup You Should Always Have". Admirals have the freedom to choose among different setups, depending on preference and situation. 
<tabber>Destroyer DD = 
=== Destroyer (DD) ===
Points for equipment selection:
* Do you need a Double Attack or a Cut In setup for night?
* Do you need a dedicated destroyer for (O)ASW duties?
* Is an Anti-Air Cut-In necessary?
* Are you fighting against an installation?

====Standard Setup====
* {{RedGunLight}}'''OR'''{{GreenGunDP}}Main Gun x2 + Wildcard
* Using 2x Main Guns allows Double Attack for destroyers in night battle.
* '''Wildcard''' can be anything except a {{RedGunLight}},{{GreenGunDP}} or {{TorpedoWeapon}}
** Adding '''any''' {{TorpedoWeapon}} or a 3rd {{RedGunLight}}/{{GreenGunDP}} to this setup will turn it into an inferior cut-in attack.
* Allows AACI as well if you combine 2x{{GreenGunDP}}[[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|10cm HA+AAFD]] + {{Radar}}[[List of Radars by stats|Air Radar]]
* For Anti-Installation duties, you can use a {{LandingCraft}} or {{WG42}} depending on the type of installation you're facing.


====Night Battle Cut-in type====
*{{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Torpedo]] x2 + any, {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Torpedo]] x3
* Setup for strong torpedo cut-in attack at night (150%*2)
* This setup is reserved for only high {{Luck}} destroyers such as {{ShipLink|Yukikaze/Kai}}, {{ShipLink|Shigure/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Hatsushimo/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Ayanami/Kai Ni}} and those with luck increased via modernization.
* Because such attacks have a {{Luck}} factor and are mostly inconsistent, unlike the Double Attack, you are not recommended to use this setup unless you are facing high armor targets.
** This applies to high luck destroyers as well. If a Double Attack is capable of defeating your enemies, then you have no reason to use a Cut In either.
* You can improve your Cut In trigger rate with night battle gear like {{Searchlight}}[[Searchlight]] or {{StarShell}}[[Star Shell]]. Flagships also have a higher trigger chance.
* Any other [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Night_Battle_Special_Attacks Cut In] setups are inferior to the Torpedo Cut In and are not recommended.

====Anti-Submarine type====
*{{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] x2 + {{DepthCharge}}[[Depth Charge]] '''OR''' {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]]
* Setup for destroyers hunting submarines.
* Ships can perform pre-emptive OASW attacks on submarines if they have at least 100 {{ASW}} '''AND''' they have at least a {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] equipped.
* There is a synergy effect when equipping at least a {{Sonar}} '''AND''' {{DepthCharge}}, which improves ASW damage by 15%
** Note that while synergy effect is important, being able to perform OASW is even more important. If you can only perform OASW by equipping 3x {{Sonar}}, simply do that.
* Useful for maps in World 4 and World 5
* As some maps have boss nodes which contains an enemy submarine, an OASW is especially useful to be able to efficiently eliminate it. This is especially important as some quests demands that you clear such boss nodes with a S rank.
* You can utilize the 3rd slot as a '''Wildcard''' if the destroyer can reach OASW requirements with only 2 ASW equipment. This allow the destroyer to have an utility role aside from carrying out ASW duties.
** As ASW damage is heavily reliant on equipment, be careful that your damage output doesn't suffer too much by using your 3rd slot as a '''Wildcard'''.



|-|Light Cruiser CL = 
=== Light Cruiser (CL) ===
'''Note:'''
* In addition to what destroyers can equip, light cruisers can also equip medium caliber guns, large radar, and recon seaplane.
* Light Cruisers can increase their range by equipping Main Gun or Secondary Gun with Range Medium, if their range is Short.
* Fundamentally a strengthened destroyer, please refer to the destroyer section as well.
* {{ShipLink|Yuubari}}, {{ShipLink|Ooyodo}}, {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Kinu/Kai Ni}} and {{ShipLink|Isuzu Kai Ni}} have special properties.
* Take note that ships with no plane slots can not utilize [[Artillery Spotting]].
* Take note that some guns give [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|fit bonuses]] for CL.

'''Points for equipment selection:'''
* Can you utilize artillery spotting?
* Do you want a Double Attack or a Cut In during day?
* Do you need a Double Attack or a Cut In setup for night?
* Do you need a dedicated light cruiser for (O)ASW duties?
* Is an Anti-Air Cut-In necessary?
* Are you fighting against an installation?
* Are you using {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}}?
* Are you using {{ShipLink|Kinu Kai/Ni}}?
* Are you using {{ShipLink|Ooyodo/Kai}} or {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai}}?

====Standard Setup====
* {{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun x2 + {{Seaplane}}Recon Seaplane '''OR''' Wildcard
* Standard setup for light cruisers which enables Artillery Spotting.
** A seaplane is mandatory for artillery spotting.
* Allows for double attacks during day and night, great damage can be expected at night.
* Requires getting [[Aerial Combat|air superiority]].
** In case you cannot utilize Artillery Spotting or you want to use the 3rd slot for something else, feel free to use the 3rd slot as a wildcard. The wildcard can be anything except a {{RedGunMedium}}, {{GreenGunDP}}, {{YellowGun}} or {{TorpedoWeapon}}.


====Night Double Attack (No AS)====
* {{TorpedoWeapon}} + {{YellowGun}} '''OR''' {{GreenGunDP}} [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Secondary_Guns_by_stats Secondary Guns] x2
* Make sure it's a '''Secondary Gun''' and not a '''Main Gun''', as {{GreenGunDP}}Small Caliber Guns are treated as '''Main Guns''', while {{GreenGunDP}}Medium Caliber Guns are treated as '''Secondary Guns'''.
* Mainly used when [[Artillery Spotting]] is not possible.
* Maximizes firepower while maintaining double attack.
* This setup is not recommended if you only have access to {{YellowGun}}[[15.2cm Single Gun Mount]], because of the terrible stats. You are better off using the standard setup instead.


====Night Cut In====
* 2x {{TorpedoWeapon}} + Wildcard; 3x {{TorpedoWeapon}}
* Setup for strong torpedo cut-in attack at night (150%*2)
* As no CL has a high base {{Luck}} to efficiently utilize Cut In attacks, this setup is mostly reserved for ships that have their luck increased through modernization.
* Because such attacks have a {{Luck}} factor and are mostly inconsistent, unlike the Double Attack, you are not recommended to use this setup unless you are facing high armor targets.
** This applies to high luck light cruisers as well. If a Double Attack is capable of defeating your enemies, then you have no reason to use a Cut In either.
* You can improve your Cut In trigger rate with night battle gear like {{Searchlight}}[[Searchlight]] or {{StarShell}}[[Star Shell]]. Flagships also have a higher trigger chance.
* Any other [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Night_Battle_Special_Attacks Cut In] setups are inferior to the Torpedo Cut In and are not recommended.


====Anti-Submarine====
*{{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] x2 + {{DepthCharge}}[[Depth Charge]] '''OR''' {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] '''OR''' Wildcard
* Setup for light cruisers hunting submarines.
* Ships can perform pre-emptive OASW attacks on submarines if they have at least 100 {{ASW}} '''AND''' they have at least a {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] equipped.
** Exception is {{ShipLink|Isuzu/Kai Ni}}, she can always perform OASW attacks regardless.
* There is a synergy effect when equipping at least a {{Sonar}} '''AND''' {{DepthCharge}}, which improves ASW damage by 15%
** Note that while synergy effect is important, being able to perform OASW is even more important. If you can only perform OASW by equipping 3x {{Sonar}}, simply do that.
* Useful for maps in World 4 and World 5. Especially useful in [[1-5]].
* As some maps have boss nodes which contains an enemy submarine, an OASW is especially useful to be able to efficiently eliminate it. This is especially important as some quests demands that you clear such boss nodes with a S rank.
* You can utilize the 3rd slot as a '''Wildcard''' if the light cruiser can reach OASW requirements with only 2 ASW equipment. This allow the destroyer to have an utility role aside from carrying out ASW duties.
** As ASW damage is heavily reliant on equipment, be careful that your damage output doesn't suffer too much by using your 3rd slot as a '''Wildcard'''.

====Anti-Installation Setup====
*{{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]] '''OR''' {{GreenGunMG}}{{Tooltip|CD|Concentrated Deployment}} + Wildcard + {{LandingCraft}}
*{{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun x2 '''OR'''{{YellowGun}}Secondary Gun x2 + {{LandingCraft}}
* Allows {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}} or {{ShipLink|Kinu/Kai Ni}} to have an anti-installation role.
* In case you want to use a {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]] or a {{GreenGunMG}}{{Tooltip|CD|Concentrated Deployment}}, it is not possible to give them a double attack setup.
** Guns qualified for Concentrated Deployment are {{GreenGunMG}}[[25mm Triple Autocannon Mount (Concentrated Deployment)|25mm CD]], {{GreenGunMG}}[[Bofors 40mm Quadruple Autocannon Mount|Bofors]] and {{GreenGunMG}}[[QF 2-pounder Octuple Pom-pom Gun Mount|Pom-pom]] guns.


====4 Slot CL====
* {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai}} and {{ShipLink|Ooyodo/Kai}} both have 4 equipment slots, unlike the other CLs.
* {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai}} has '''no''' plane slots. While it's still possible for her to equip seaplanes and gain stats and {{LoS}}, she cannot perform [[Artillery Spotting]] in any circumstances.
* Ooyodo has terrible base {{ASW}} stats, which makes it harder for her to reach OASW requirements, unlike {{ShipLink|Yuubari/Kai|text=Yuubari}}.
* Ooyodo has low {{Torpedo}} stats, but has better {{HP}} and {{Armor}}, which makes her excellent for Anti-Installation purposes.


=====4 Slot Anti-Submarine=====
*{{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] 3x + {{DepthCharge}}[[Depth Charge]] '''OR''' {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]]
* The same rules applies to the 4 slots light cruisers, the only difference is that you now have another equipment slot available.
* You only receive the synergy bonus once. Equipping 2x {{Sonar}} and 2x {{DepthCharge}} will not do anything extra.
* Because of how poor the base {{ASW}} stats is of Ooyodo, Yuubari is better suited for this role.


=====4 Slot Anti-Installation=====
*{{RedGunMedium}} Main x2 + {{WG42}}[[WG42]] x2
* A setup focused on destroying installations who are weak to [[WG42]] during night battle.
* As {{ShipLink|Ooyodo/Kai}} has better survivability, she is recommended for this role.


====CLT Abukuma====
* {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}} is unique in the way that she functions exactly like a CLT, while being classified as a CL.
* Check the CLT section for more information regarding {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}}

|-|Torpedo Cruiser CLT = 
=== Torpedo Cruiser (CLT) ===
'''Note:'''
* Torpedo Cruisers can equip {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]] to fire an opening torpedo. Torpedo Cruisers are recommended to always have at least a {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]] equipped.
* Note that {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]] is '''NOT''' treated as a torpedo. Equipping one of those will not turn your attacks into [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Night_Battle_Special_Attacks Cut Ins].
* CLTs have no plane slots.
* Because CLTs cannot utilize [[Artillery Spotting]], using {{YellowGun}} is perfectly acceptable.
* {{ShipLink|Abukuma Kai Ni}} functions exactly like a CLT, even though she is classified as a CL.
* Take note that some guns give [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|fit bonuses]] for CLT.

'''Points for equipment selection:'''
* Are you fighting a very tough surface boss?
* Do you need a dedicated torpedo cruiser for (O)ASW duties?
* Is an opening torpedo important?

|}

====Standard Setup====
*{{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun x2 '''OR'''{{YellowGun}}Secondary Gun x2 + {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]]
* Decent single attack during day battle and double attack during night battle
* Since [[Artillery Spotting]] is not a factor here, the only thing that matters are stats. It does not matter whether you use a {{RedGunMedium}} or a {{YellowGun}}.
* Because CLTs have innate very high {{Firepower}} and {{Torpedo}} stats, their double attack is incredibly powerful, being able to destroy most of the toughest enemies in the game.


====Torpedo Setup====
*{{TorpedoWeapon}}Torpedo x2 + {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki}}
* Maximizes torpedo damage while allowing a torpedo cut in attack (150%*2)
** This comes at the cost of having weaker shelling during day, since you're not using guns.
** Keep in mind that both {{ShipLink|Kitakami/Kai Ni|text=Kitakami}} and {{ShipLink|Ooi/Kai Ni|text=Ooi}} already hit the torpedo cap with only the {{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki}}. Equipping more torpedoes on them will not boost their torpedo attacks significantly, due to the soft-cap.
* This setup is generally reserved for high {{Luck}} ships, generally for those who are really close to 50 {{Luck}}. Equipping ships with this setup, especially {{ShipLink|Kitakami/Kai Ni|text=Kitakami}} who already has a base luck of 30, is generally bad practice if their luck nowhere near the 50.
* Torpedo cut-in is only marginally stronger than the double attack, but activates less often and is inconsistent. Use this only if it is truly necessary or if you know what you are doing.
** Exceptions are {{ShipLink|Kiso/Kai Ni}} and {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}}. Since their {{Torpedo}} stats are nowhere near {{ShipLink|Kitakami/Kai Ni|text=Kitakami}} or {{ShipLink|Ooi/Kai Ni|text=Ooi}}, they generally benefit from using this setup if they have a sufficiently high {{Luck}} and they are fighting against tougher enemies. Likewise, both {{ShipLink|Kitakami/Kai Ni|text=Kitakami}} and {{ShipLink|Ooi/Kai Ni|text=Ooi}} will not benefit as much, due to the soft-cap.


====Anti-Submarine Setup====
*{{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] + {{DepthCharge}}[[Depth Charge]] '''OR''' {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] + {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] '''OR''' Wildcard
* Allow torpedo cruisers to have an ASW role.
* Ships can perform pre-emptive OASW attacks on submarines if they have at least 100 {{ASW}} '''AND''' they have at least a {{Sonar}}[[Sonar]] equipped.
* There is a synergy effect when equipping at least a {{Sonar}} '''AND''' {{DepthCharge}}, which improves ASW damage by 15%
** Note that while synergy effect is important, being able to perform OASW is even more important. If you can only perform OASW by equipping 3x Sonar, simply do that.
* If it is possible to reach OASW requirements with 2 slots, you can use the 3rd slot for something else.
** It is definitely possible to use a {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]] in this scenario, which allows them to perform opening torpedo attacks aside from ASW duties.

|-|Heavy Cruiser CA =
=== Heavy Cruiser (CA) ===
'''Note:'''
* Certain guns give [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|night battle fit bonuses]] for CA(V).
* {{ShipLink|Zara/Kai}} and {{ShipLink|Pola/Kai}} are capable of equipping {{Seaplane Fighter}}[[Seaplane Fighters]] and {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Seaplane Bombers].
* {{ShipLink|Maya Kai Ni}} has the strongest AACI in the game, which requires a specific setup.
* Cannot attack submarines, even if you have {{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers|Seaplane Bombers]] equipped.

'''Points for equipment selection:'''
* Can you utilize artillery spotting?
* Do you want a Double Attack or a Cut In during day?
* Do you need a Double Attack or a Cut In setup for night?
* Are you using {{ShipLink|Maya/Kai Ni}} for her AACI?
* Are you fighting against an installation?

====Standard Setup====
*{{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun x2 + {{Radar}}Radar OR Wildcard + {{Seaplane}}Recon Seaplane
* Standard setup for heavy cruisers which allows day and night double attack.
* The wildcard can be anything as long as its not a {{RedGunMedium}}, {{GreenGunDP}}, {{YellowGun}} or {{TorpedoWeapon}}.
* Requires getting [[Aerial Combat|air superiority]].
** In case installations are involved, you can substitute the wildcard for a {{GreenAmmo}}[[Type 3 Shell]].
** In case you're using either {{ShipLink|Zara Kai}} or {{ShipLink|Pola Kai}}, you can substitute the wildcard with a <br />{{Seaplane Fighter}}[[Seaplane Fighters]] if you wish.
*** You are not recommended to use {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Seaplane Bombers], because of their very small slot sizes. Using {{Seaplane Fighter}}[[Seaplane Fighters]] however, is fine.


====Night Double Attack (No AS)====
*{{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun + {{YellowGun}} '''OR''' {{GreenGunDP}}Secondary Gun x3
* Mainly used when [[Artillery Spotting]] is not possible.
* Maximizes firepower while maintaining double attack.
* {{Firepower}} is what matters in the end with this setup, simply use your strongest guns to build this setup with your CA.
* This setup is not recommended if you only have access to [[15.2cm Single Gun Mount]], because of the terrible stats. You are better off using the standard setup instead.


====Night Cut In====
*{{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Torpedo]] x2 + '''Wildcard''' x2; {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Torpedo]] x4
* Setup focused on dealing heavy damage (150%*2) through a Torpedo Cut In during night battle.
* This setup is generally reserved for high {{Luck}} ships.
* Torpedo cut-in is only marginally stronger than the double attack, but activates less often and is inconsistent. Use this only if it is truly necessary.


====Maya AACI====
*{{GreenGunMG}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Anti-Air_Guns_by_stats Concentrated Deployment] + {{GreenGunDP}} + {{Radar}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Radars_by_stats Air Radar] + {{RedGunMedium}} '''OR''' {{GreenGunDP}}
* A special setup for {{ShipLink|Maya Kai Ni}} which allows her to use the best AACI in the game while retaining the ability to double attack during night. Note that this specific setup only works for {{ShipLink|Maya Kai Ni}}.
* Guns qualified for Concentrated Deployment are {{GreenGunMG}}[[25mm Triple Autocannon Mount (Concentrated Deployment)|25mm CD]], {{GreenGunMG}}[[Bofors 40mm Quadruple Autocannon Mount|Bofors]] and {{GreenGunMG}}[[QF 2-pounder Octuple Pom-pom Gun Mount|Pom-pom]] guns.


|-|Aviation Cruiser CAV = 
=== Aviation Cruiser (CAV) ===
'''Note:'''
* Basically a Heavy Cruiser with additional aviation equipment possible
* Certain guns give [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|night battle fit bonuses]] for CA(V).
* Can attack submarines with the use of {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Seaplane Bombers] and/or {{Autogyro}}[[Ka Type Observation Autogyro|Autogyro]]
* Each equipment slot have their own size, make sure you make the most of it by equipping {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Seaplane Bombers] on the largest slot sizes.
** {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Seaplane Bombers] on bigger slots does not increase your damage against submarines.
* Can equip {{Drum}}[[Drum Canister (Transport Use)|Drum Canister]].
* Can equip both {{GreenAmmo}}[[Type 3 Shell|Type 3]] and {{WG42}}[[WG42]].
* Can equip {{SCAMP}}[[SCAMP]].


'''Points for equipment selection:'''
* Can you utilize artillery spotting?
* Do you want a Double Attack or a Cut In during day?

* Good equipments for the wildcard are {{Radar}}[[Radar]], {{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane]], {{GreenAmmo}}, {{WG42}} and {{SCAMP}}[[SCAMP]].
* You cannot use a {{Seaplane Fighter}}Seaplane Fighter for [[Artillery Spotting]]. Use the Wildcard slot if you need to equip {{Seaplane Fighter}}Seaplane Fighters.
* If equipped with a seaplane bomber, your CAV will prioritize attacking enemy submarines. If this is not desired, switch to a {{Seaplane}}Recon instead.


====Anti-Installation====
*{{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun x2 + {{GreenAmmo}}[[Type 3 Shell|Type 3]] '''OR''' {{WG42}}[[WG42]] + {{WG42}}[[WG42]]
* Standard anti-installation setup for CAV, which also allows double attack during night.
* This setup does not utilize [[Artillery Spotting]], but instead focuses on dealing maximum damage during night against installations.
* Use {{GreenAmmo}} or {{WG42}} depending on the weakness of the enemy [[Installation]]. Do not stack {{GreenAmmo}}[[Type 3 Shell|Type 3]] as the bonuses do not stack.
** Multiple {{WG42}}[[WG42]] does stack, but each extra giving decremented bonuses.

====Seaplane Bomber Mule====
*{{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Seaplane Bomber] x4
* Pure {{Seaplane}}Bomber focus, no special attacks during day or night.
* Usage is extremely situational and restricted to circumstances where you can only use CAVs in a map full of submarines or if for some reason, having a {{Seaplane}}Bomber mule is much preferred.
* It is perfectly possible to replace {{Seaplane}}Bombers with {{Autogyro}}[[Ka Type Observation Autogyro|Autogyro]] if your goal is only ASW related.


====Seaplane Fighter Setup====
*{{RedGunMedium}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Main_Guns_by_stats#Medium_Guns Main] x2 + {{Seaplane Fighter}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Seaplanes_by_stats#Seaplane_Fighters Fighter] x2
* Allows you to establish [[Aerial Combat|air superiority]] with CAV while retaining double attack during night.
* This is an important setup to utilize if carriers are not available and you want to establish [[Aerial Combat|air superiority]].


====Night Double Attack (No AS)====
*{{RedGunMedium}}Main Gun + {{YellowGun}} '''OR''' {{GreenGunDP}}Secondary Gun x3
* Very rarely used on CAV, mainly because of the other utility options a CAV has in comparison to CA.<br />CA also generally have marginally more {{Firepower}} compared to CAV.
* Mainly used when [[Artillery Spotting]] is not possible and you cannot use CA for some reason.
* Maximizes firepower while maintaining double attack.
* {{Firepower}} is what matters in the end with this setup, simply use your strongest guns to build this setup with your CAV.
* This setup is not recommended if you only have access to [[15.2cm Single Gun Mount]], because of the terrible stats. You are better off using the standard setup instead.


|-|(Fast)Battleship (F)BB = 
=== (Fast)Battleship ((F)BB) ===
'''Note:'''
* BB have high firepower and use main guns to attack enemy ships.
* Day battle attack power cap can be reached easily with most battleships.
** The day damage softcap is 150. As most battleships can easily reach this cap, it is preferrable to focus on {{Hit}} stats instead.
* Can use artillery spotting to further increase attack.([[Aerial Combat|Air superiority required]])
** [[Artillery Spotting]] is a postcap multiplier that ignores the damage softcap. This allows you to deal even more damage during the day.
* [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|Fit gun mechanics]] are drastically different on battleships in the sense that aside from bonuses, there are also penalties included for using overweight guns. Each ship class also have their own set of guns that are fit and overweight, check out [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|this page]] for more information regarding this.
* Cannot attack submarines, even if you have {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Bombers] equipped.
* Can equip {{RedAmmo}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Shells_by_stats#Armor_Piercing_Shells {{Tooltip|AP Shell|Armor Piercing Shell}}]
* The {{ShipLink|Italia|Roma Kai|text=V.V. Class Kai|link_class=Vittorio Veneto}}, {{ShipLink|Nagato Kai|Mutsu Kai|text=Nagato class Kai|link_class=Nagato}} and {{ShipLink|Yamato Kai|Musashi Kai|text=Yamato class Kai|link_class=Yamato}} are capable of carrying {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Fighters Fighters]
* Only {{ShipLink|Italia}} and {{ShipLink|Roma Kai}} are capable of equipping {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Bombers].
** Because of their poor slots, you are not recommended to use any {{Seaplane}}[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Seaplane#Seaplane_Bombers Bombers].

'''Points for equipment selection:'''
* Can you utilize artillery spotting?
* Do you want a Double Attack or a Cut In during day?
* Are you fighting against an installation?

|-|Aircraft Carriers CV(L/B) = 
=== Aircraft Carrier (CV(B)) and Light Aircraft Carrier (CVL) ===
Because the way of how carriers works, there simply is no static setups available for them as each map demands a different setup depending on the situation. However, we will provide guidelines here on how you want to equip your planes on your carriers, so you can maximize your efficiency as much as possible.


'''Note:'''
* Aircraft are capable of [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranking up]], making them much more efficient in their role.
* Carriers are capable of launching an opening airstike when equipped with bombers.
* {{RedPlane}}Dive Bomber and {{BluePlane}}Torpedo Bomber can participate in shelling phase
* Carriers can '''NOT''' attack if they are not equipped with any bombers.
** Carriers can '''NOT''' attack either if all the bombers are shot down during the opening phase.
* Carriers cannot shell during day when they are medium damaged (<span style="color:orange;">'''中破'''</span>).
** Exceptions are armored carriers like {{ShipLink|Taihou}}, {{ShipLink|Shoukaku Kai Ni A}} and {{ShipLink|Zuikaku Kai Ni A}}, they only stop shelling when they are heavily damaged (<span style="color:red;">'''大破'''</span>).
* Carriers cannot participate in night battle.
** Exception is {{ShipLink|Graf Zeppelin}} and the base form of {{ShipLink|Saratoga}}, but since their planes are not capable of attacking during night, their uses during night battle becomes very limited.
* Do not use bombers in a PvP match, because the bauxite loss can be terrifying depending on your opponent setup.
* Take caution when you are facing enemies with high {{AA}} stats like the {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|text=Tsu-class}}.
* Establishing Air Superiority is your priority, Aerial bombing is just a bonus.
* Your opening airstrike damage is affected by the plane slots and whether you use a {{RedPlane}} or a {{BluePlane}}.
* Shelling damage is unrelated to plane count, as long as there is at least one plane.
** Default range is Short for most of the carriers, but it may be increased by equipping {{YellowGun}} Secondary gun with range Medium or {{AviationPersonnel}}[[Skilled Carrier-based_Aircraft_Maintenance_Personnel|SCAMP]] with range Long
* Light Aircraft Carrier can attack submarines
** Can equip {{SubPlane}}[[Type 3 Spotter/Liaison (ASW)]] and/or {{Autogyro}}[[Ka-type Observation Autogyro]] in addition for higher anti-submarine stat {{ASW}}
*** Keep in mind that {{SubPlane}} and {{Autogyro}} alone cannot allow you to attack submarines, you are still required to have at least a {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}} equipped.


====Guidelines====
Best practices when setting up your equipment where carriers are involved. Keep in mind that you can always freely switch slots around on the same ship, by holding your mouse for a few seconds and dragging it.
* Always try to prioritize getting at least AS and preferably AS+ with {{GreenPlane}}Fighters. Do not overshoot your fighter power target, fighter power itself only helps you achieve a specific air control, but does not do anything else extra. Do not make the mistake in believing that having more fighter power equals to more opponent planes being shot down.
* When equipping {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, prioritize equipping them on the '''smallest''' slots. Do not worry about the low plane slots, because fighters only suffer from proportional shot downs.
* After that, use either {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}}Bombers to fill in the rest of the slot. Always attempt to use bombers on the '''biggest''' slots or the first slot if possible.
** When trying to conserve bauxite, avoid using big slots and prioritize using plane slot numbers that are closer to 17. This is to minimize proportional shot downs. Do not attempt this though, if the map does not allow you to conserve bauxite.
* Now that your slots are loaded out, it is time to decide whether you want to use a {{YellowPlane}}Recon or not. Recons have a higher chance of initiating Contact, which increases the airstrike damage.
** {{EquipmentLink|Saiun}}, if you also want to prevent <span style="color:red">Red-T</span> during battles.
** Anything else, if you're not interested in preventing <span style="color:red">Red-T</span>, like {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft|text=Type 2 Recon}}, {{EquipmentLink|Prototype Keiun (Carrier-based Reconnaissance Model)|text=Keiun}}
* If you are using a CVL in an submarine infested map like [[1-5]] for example, you can choose to replace the bombers with {{SubPlane}} and {{Autogyro}}.

'''Example 1:'''
Note: Assume that all the planes are [[File:Aircraft Proficiency Gold Chevron.png]].<br />
Map [[2-5]] requires 35/69 to reach {{Tooltip|AS/AS+|Air Superiority/Air Supremacy}} respectively, if you use the south route. With 3 CVL, you can easily reach AS+ with the following setup:

Map [[4-5]] requires 207/414 to reach {{Tooltip|AS/AS+|Air Superiority/Air Supremacy}} respectively, while you're using a 2CV(B) setup. Since the boss is an [[installation]] and getting AS+ with only 2 carrier is unrealistic, we use {{RedPlane}}Bombers as well as try to aim for AS instead. As you're simply lacking slots on carriers while the engagement modifier is not a threat, a {{YellowPlane}}[[Saiun]] was not necessary.

====Fighters====
*{{GreenPlane}}[[List of Fighters by stats|Fighters]]
* Primarily used to increase your fighter power for establishing [[Aerial Combat|air superiority]].
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives more flat fighter power bonuses.
* Keep in mind, if your opponent has no {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, your own {{GreenPlane}}Fighters become useless as well.
* Having more fighter power than required will not do anything beneficial, avoid doing that to maximize the efficiency of your slots as much as possible.
*{{GreenPlane}}Fighters only participate in the first phase of [[Aerial Combat]]. This means that {{GreenPlane}}Fighters only lose planes proportional to the slot size and are immune to {{AA}} fire.
** This makes it very beneficial to equip fighters to very small slot sizes, because that will effectively prevent you from losing any planes provided you can consistently achieve air superiority or higher.
** Another reason why equipping {{GreenPlane}}Fighters in smaller slots works, is because the majority of your fighter power comes from [[Aircraft Proficiency]].


====Torpedo Bomber====
*{{BluePlane}}[[List of Torpedo Bombers by stats|Torpedo Bomber]]
* The primary bomber which you will always be using, except for a few exceptions.
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased critical hit rate and an increased critical damage up to 10%, while also providing minor boost to fighter power.
** {{BluePlane}}Bombers on first slots of a carrier receives double bonus and can reach up to 20% increased critical damage damage.
* Has a 0.8x or 1.5x multiplier during pre-emptive attacks.
* Bombers on bigger slots do more damage during the opening airstrike.
* Weaker in shelling compared to {{RedPlane}}Bomber, but irrelevant as you use stronger planes.
* Unlike {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, bombers participate in the first and second phase of the [[Aerial Combat]]. This mean that bombers are prone to being shot down by enemy {{AA}} fire. It is thus not recommended to equip bombers on very small slots if you know your enemy {{AA}} is going to be high.
* Performs weaker in [[Support Expedition]]s.
* {{BluePlane}}Bombers '''CAN''' attack [[installation]]s.
* Has a chance to trigger contact, unlike {{RedPlane}}Bomber.


====Dive Bomber====
*{{RedPlane}}[[List of Dive Bombers by stats|Dive Bomber]]
* The secondary bomber which you will be using, in scenarios where using a {{BluePlane}}Bomber is disadvantageous.
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased critical hit rate and an increased critical damage up to 10%, while also providing minor boost to fighter power.
** {{RedPlane}}Bombers on first slots of a carrier receives double bonus and can reach up to 20% increased critical damage.
* Has a static 1x multiplier during pre-emptive attacks.
* Bombers on bigger slots do more damage during the opening airstrike.
* Stronger in shelling compared to {{BluePlane}}Bomber, but irrelevant as stronger planes are obtained.
* Unlike {{GreenPlane}}Fighters, bombers participate in the first and second phase of the [[Aerial Combat]]. This mean that bombers are prone to being shot down by enemy {{AA}} fire. It is thus not recommended to equip bombers on very small slots if you know your enemy {{AA}} is going to be high.
* Prevents carriers from attacking [[installation]]s during the shelling phase if the carrier has at least 1 {{RedPlane}}Bomber equipped.
** This can be advantageous, because carriers lack the necessary anti-installation equipment to be able to efficiently deal with them. Instead, they can help assist in clearing out the other surface enemies.
* The primary bomber you will be using for [[Support Expedition]].
* Cannot trigger contact.



====Fighter Bomber====
*{{BluePlane}} or {{RedPlane}}Bombers with fighter properties.
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased critical hit rate and an increased critical damage up to 10%, while also providing minor boost to fighter power.
** {{RedPlane}} and {{BluePlane}}Fighter Bombers on first slots of a carrier receives double bonus and can reach up to 20% increased critical damage.
* Known fighter bombers are:
**{{RedPlane}}[[Type 0 Fighter Model 62 (Fighter-bomber)|M62 Fighter Bomber]]
**{{RedPlane}}[[Zero Fighter Model 62 (Fighter-bomber / Iwai Squadron)|M62 Fighter Bomber(Iwai Squadron)]]
**{{BluePlane}}[[Re.2001 G Kai]].
* Functions exactly like a bomber, while providing a reasonable amount of AA power.
** Because they function exactly like a bomber, they too are susceptible to enemy {{AA}} fire. It is thus not recommended to equip bombers on very small slots if you know your enemy {{AA}} is going to be high.
* While they have an unique mechanic, their stats are worse than the {{GreenPlane}}Fighters and genuine {{RedPlane}} and {{BluePlane}}Bombers.
* Unless you have no choice and you have to use those fighter bombers just to barely increase your fighter power above the AS/AS+ range, you generally should attempt to switch your carrier slots around to maximize your fighter power.


====Recon Aircraft====
*{{YellowPlane}}[[Saiun]]; {{YellowPlane}}[[Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft|Type 2 Recon]]; {{YellowPlane}}[[Prototype Keiun (Carrier-based Reconnaissance Model)|Keiun]]
* Higher [[Aircraft Proficiency|ranks]] gives increased [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Contact contact] chance.
* Does not participate in [[Aerial Combat]] phases and thus, cannot be shot down.
*{{YellowPlane}}[[Saiun]] is primarily used to prevent [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Engagement_Form_Modifier Red-T] while also giving you a decent modifier for [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Contact contact].
**Note that preventing Red-T is not always advantageous or necessary. As Red-T also affects your enemy, it is sometimes even better to get Red-T.
*{{YellowPlane}}[[Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft|Type 2 Recon]] or the {{YellowPlane}}[[Prototype Keiun (Carrier-based Reconnaissance Model)|Keiun]] is used to increase your contact rate and damage modifier in scenarios where you don't want to prevent [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Engagement_Form_Modifier Red-T].
* The use of a {{YellowPlane}}Recon should only be considered when you can efficiently achieve air superiority while also maintaining a lot of bombers to attack your enemy with it or if the {{LOS}} stats provided is necessary for the branching rules.


====Jet Aircraft====
* [[File:Jet-powered Fighter-Bomber Icon 1.png]]{{EquipmentLink|Jet Keiun Kai}}; [[File:Jet-powered Fighter-Bomber Icon 2.png]]{{EquipmentLink|Kikka Kai}}
* Can only be equipped by {{ShipLink|Shoukaku/Kai Ni A}} and {{ShipLink|Zuikaku/Kai Ni A}}.
* As of now, only Jet Fighter-Bomber variants exists. The [[Aircraft Proficiency]] ranks functions the same as their regular counterpart.
* Surviving planes uses {{Steel}} to resupply, while Jets that are shot down are replenished with {{Bauxite}} as normal.
* Jets are unique in the way that they have their own "[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Jet_Assault Jet Assault]" phase in which they can preemptively launch an attack on the enemy before the 1st phase happens. After the Jet Assault phase ends, they participate along with the regular aircraft in the 1st and 2nd phase.
* Jet Fighter-Bombers are susceptible to {{AA}} fire during the "Jet Assault" and the "2nd Phase". This means that they suffer twice the shot downs from the enemy and in theory, they can be attacked twice by [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Aerial_Combat#Anti-Air_Cut-In AACI]. They are however, more resistant to the proportional shot downs in the 1st phase of [[Aerial Combat]].
* Since they suffer twice the shot down rate from enemy {{AA}} fire, you are recommended to use them in bigger slots if you want them to be useful. You are not recommended to use Jets if the map features several high {{AA}} enemies like {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|text=enemy tsu classes}} or {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp|text=Artillery Imps}}.


====Anti-Submarine Aircraft====
* Primarily {{SubPlane}}[[Type 3 Spotter/Liaison (ASW)]] and {{Autogyro}}[[Ka Type Observation Autogyro|Autogyro]].
* Used in conjunction with a {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}} to increase your {{ASW}}.
* Keep in mind that {{SubPlane}} and {{Autogyro}} alone cannot allow you to attack submarines, you are still required to have at least a {{RedPlane}} or {{BluePlane}} equipped.


|-|Seaplane Tender AV =
=== Seaplane Tender (AV) ===
Seaplane Tenders are basically an even lighter and flexible version of {{Tooltip|CVLs|Light Carriers}}, with most of them having the ability to equip a {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]]. While they function pretty similar to a carrier, they perform their shelling without seaplanes, the aircraft they have access to are a lot weaker compared to standard aircrafts and they can attack as normal even when <span style="color:orange">'''中破'''</span>, which separates them from carriers.
<br />
Currently, {{ShipLink|Mizuho}}, {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}}, {{ShipLink|Chitose}}, {{ShipLink|Chiyoda}}, {{ShipLink|Commandant Teste}} and {{ShipLink|Kamoi Kai}} are the only members of this versatile, but fragile class. Chitose and Chiyoda remain as seaplane tender on first and second remodels and change class to light aircraft carrier on third.
{{ShipLink|Kamoi}} starts as a fleet oiler and changes class to seaplane tender on her first remodel, on her second remodel she reverts back to fleet oiler.
<br />
{{ShipLink|Akitsushima}}, while being listed as an AV, is actually a giant flying boat tender. Take note that {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}} may not be able to equip the same equipments as the other AVs do.

'''Note:'''
* Can participate in Aerial Phase when equipped with {{Seaplane}}Seaplane Bombers.
* Can participate in Opening Torpedo when equipped with {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]] and closing torpedo phase.
** Exceptions are {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}} and {{ShipLink|Commandant Teste}}, as they both have no {{Torpedo}} stats and are incapable of equipping a {{TorpedoWeapon}}[[Type A Kouhyouteki]].
* Can participate in shelling, regardless of whether {{Seaplane}}Seaplane Bombers are equipped.
** Can attack submarines, but requires {{Seaplane}}Seaplane Bombers to do so.
* Can perform [[Artillery Spotting]] when Air Superiority is achieved or better.
* Can participate in night battle.
* Can equip {{LandingCraft}}Daihatsu to increase resource gained from expedition.
** {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}} is incapable of equipping {{LandingCraft}}Daihatsus
* As {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}} is a flying boat tender, she is the only ship at the moment capable of equipping flying boats like {{Flying Boat}}[[Type 2 Large Flying Boat|Taitei]] and {{Flying Boat}}[[PBY-5A Catalina|Catalina]].


'''Points for equipment selection:'''
* Which AV are you using and how many slots does she have available?
* Is the air power requirement low?
* Do you want them to be able to perform [[Artillery Spotting]]?

====Standard 3 slot AV====
*{{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane|Fighter or Bomber]] / {{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane|Fighter or Bomber]] + {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki|text=Minisub}}
* This setup deals an airstrike as well as an opening torpedo attack against your enemies. This will be the most common setup you will be using.
* AV have small slots to begin with, so be careful of using bombers on small slots and prioritize them in big slots instead.
** However, there's no problem with fighters on smaller slots, as they are immune to {{AA}} fire from the enemies.
{{Clear}}

====Full Seaplane focus====
*{{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane|Fighter or Bomber]] / {{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane|Fighter or Bomber]] / {{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane|Fighter or Bomber]] / {{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane|Fighter or Bomber]] 
* The goal is to use as many seaplane fighters or bombers as you can to establish the air superiority. 
*You will be dropping the {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki|text=Minisub}} in favor of gaining more air power, so only consider this if a standard setup is not sufficient enough, or if you're using an AV that cannot equip the {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki|text=Minisub}} to begin with.
{{Clear}}

===={{ShipLink|Commandant Teste/Kai|text=Commandant Teste}} Double Attack====
*{{RedGunLight}}[[List of Main Guns by stats#Light_Guns|Main]] / {{RedGunLight}}[[List of Main Guns by stats#Light_Guns|Main]] / {{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane|Recon or Bomber]] / '''Wildcard'''
* Allows you to deal double attacks during day and night.
* A setup which is only realistic for those who either cannot equip the {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki|text=Minisub}} or if they have 4 equipment slots available, while also having reasonable plain slots and base {{Firepower}} stats. As of now, only {{ShipLink|Commandant Teste/Kai|text=Commandant Teste}} fits this criteria.
* You can substitute the wildcard with either a {{Seaplane}}Seaplane or a {{RedGunLight}}Main gun.
** Keep in mind while it is possible to equip a third main gun for increased shelling power during day, you will lose your double attack during night. If this is undesirable, avoid doing that.
{{Clear}}

===={{ShipLink|Akitsushima}}====
* {{Flying Boat}}{{Seaplane Fighter}}[[Seaplane Fighter]] or [[Flying Boat]] / {{Seaplane Fighter}}[[Seaplane Fighter]] / {{Seaplane Fighter}}[[Seaplane Fighter]]
* Allows you to use {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}} as a seaplane fighter mule, as she is literally pretty much useless in any other role.
* Since she has plane slot sizes of 1, she is the best fighter mule in the game as practically any fighter equipped on her is invincible, even during the 1st phase.
* She is also capable of carrying giant boats like {{Flying Boat}}[[Type 2 Large Flying Boat|Taitei]] and {{Flying Boat}}[[PBY-5A Catalina|Catalina]], which provides a reasonable amount of stats and {{LOS}}.
** You can freely use a seaplane fighter instead, if using a flying boat is not necessary at all.
* Do not under any circumstances attempt to use bombers on her 1 slots instead, as they are susceptible to {{AA}} fire from enemies.

|-| Amphibious Assault Ship (LHA) = 
=== Amphibious Assault Ship ===
The only ship class outside of carriers who is capable of equipping {{GreenPlane}}Fighters. While definitely not strong by any means, she has her uses in certain maps.

Characteristics:
* Can participate in Aerial Phase
** Can equip Fighters, though unremodeled Akitsumaru has 0 plane slots, so this is only effective after remodelling
* Can participate in shelling
* Can attack submarines when equipped with [[Ka-type Observation Autogyro]] or [[Type 3 Spotter/Liaison (ASW)]]
* Can participate in night battle, but cannot attack submarines at night
* Can equip Daihatsus to increase resource gained from expedition
Currently, {{ShipLink|Akitsu Maru}} and {{ShipLink|Shinshuu Maru}} are the only members of this class.

Firepower and Armor are lower than a Destroyer, and her plane count is lower than that of a Light Aircraft Carrier, she is not suited at all to fight against other ships. But, she can act as a fighter mule by equipping fighters. This can be useful for maps where LHA branching rules comes into play.

Recommended equipment for Amphibious Assault Ship:
* '''Aerial Support type''' ({{GreenPlane}}Fighter x3)
** To get higher Fighter Power for Air Superiority.
* '''Anti-submarine type '''({{GreenPlane}}Fighter + ({{Autogyro}}[[Ka-type Observation_Autogyro|Autogyro]] OR {{ASWPlane}}[[Type 3_Spotter/Liaison_(ASW)|Type 3 (ASW)]]) x2)
** Can attack submarines while also contributing fighters.



|-|Submarines SS(V) = 
=== Submarine (SS) Aircraft-Carrying Submarine (SSV) ===
Before level 10, can participate in opening torpedo only when equipped with midget subs. At Level 10 and higher, will always participate in opening torpedo.

Recommended Equipment for Submarines:
* '''Torpedo type''' ({{TorpedoWeapon}}Torpedo x2)
** Only setup for submarines that allows for night cut-in.
** For maps where night battle is important or to increase preemptive torpedo damage
* '''Aerial Bombing type '''({{Seaplane}}[[Seaplane]] x2)
** SSV are capable of equipping Seaplane fighters as well as bombers.
** As your plane sizes are really small, trying to use seaplane bombers is not recommended at all.
