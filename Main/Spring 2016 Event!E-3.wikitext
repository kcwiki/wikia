===Branching rules===
*This map is a [[Combined_Fleet|Combined Transport Fleet]] map.

All fleets start at node B.
*Fast fleet will route B → D directly.
*Slow fleet will route B → A → C.
**Two BBV will route C → E → D.
**Otherwise C → D.
***D → F → G is guaranteed.
***Slow fleet will route G → I → J → K.
***Fast fleet with large number of [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]] and [[Drum Canister (Transport Use)]] has higher chance to route G → H → J → K.
***Otherwise G → J → K.
***Offroute conditions for H → L and J → M unknown.

===Suggested compositions===
*2 CAV + 4 DD | CL + 3 DD + 2 CA/V will route B → D → F → G → H → J → K or B → D → F → G → J → K.  

===Tips===
*'''Note:''' [[Ka Mi]] / [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Landing Craft]] and [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]] will not be recognized as a Daihatsu, so it will not be counted and displayed when you reach the TP node (e.g., if you carry 4 Daihatsu and 1 T89 then it'll only display 4 Daihatsu). '''However''', they will still affect the TP bar (check the [[Events/Mechanics#Map-specific_Mechanics|Mechanics]] to see how much).
*Equip some Daihatsu or Drum to drain TP faster. 
*Node and boss shelling support is highly recommended.

===Note===
*Clearing E-3 unlocks the [[Land Base Aerial Support]].
*This map only consists of a TP gauge. By depleting the TP gauge, you can clear the map; final kill is not needed.
*An A rank is required to deplete TP, however A rank will only deplete TP by 70% of an S rank.
*While there was a bug between May 4th and May 6th when U-511 (or I-401) did not drop for Admirals who already possessed 2 or more U-511/Ro-500 (or I-401), this bug has been fixed [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/728386089006682112][http://kcvdb.jp/verification/2016/05/17/koshian001/]. However, the drop rate is still dependent on how many U-511/Ro-500 (or I-401) are in possession, e.g., on Hard (for nodes D and F) it is 2-3% with no U-511/Ro-500 in possession, 1% with one, and 0.5% with two or more (1.5%, 0.5%, and 0.25% for Easy).
