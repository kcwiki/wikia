Boasting high-speed performance, the successor of the "Type 99 Carrier-based Bomber", the "Suisei". It is equipped with a liquid-cooled engine. It is faster than typical fighters, even its Zero-fighter escorts. Although it is difficult to maintain, its excellence as a carrier-based dive bomber is undeniable. Please do use it as the core of your mobile squadron.

The Suisei was a single-engine carrier-based dive bomber and the successor to the Type 99 Dive Bomber. In 1938, the IJN imported a pair of He 118 dive bombers for evaluation by Yokosuka after losing to the Ju 87 for contract manufacturing rights. One example collapsed under the stress of the dive just like before, so Yokosuka decided to make an entirely new aircraft inspired by the He 118. Its final design ended up being smaller in every way possible, lighter, more maneuverable and much more faster that it became one of the fastest dive bombers of the war, even faster than its fighter escort, the Zero fighter. Though completed by 1940, its production was delayed because a fatal flaw in the airframe was discovered that would collapse in itself under steep dives just like the He 118, so it had to make its debut as a recon plane instead in mid-1942, the Type 2 Recon. The problem was finally fixed in early-1943 and debuted in battle the worst way possible during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, dubbed "The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot". Afterwards, it saw some success as a dive bomber by sinking USS Princeton and damaging several other ships due to the heavy payload it carried compared to the Type 99 Dive Bomber. By late-1944 however, the IJN realized the Suisei was a near perfect aircraft for their Kamikaze attacks with its high speed and payload capacity and was used to even greater effect than its intended dive bombing purpose, damaging several more carriers including USS Intrepid. Its last sortie was a Kamikaze mission and done after Japanese surrender by admiral Matome Ugaki who did not want to concede defeat, was shot down presumably by AA fire.

The Suisei had 4 main variants developed in its lifetime. The Model 11/21 were the first design with the Model 21 having catapult equipment installed for the Ise-class aviation battleships. The Model 12/22 upgraded the rear-firing machine gun to 13mm and also catapult equipment. The Model 33 was a land-based version after losing the majority of its carriers, it replaced the unreliable Aichi Atsuta engine with the Kinsei 62 engine and massively increased reliability. The Model 43 was the Special Attack Kamikaze Bomber which removed equipment to make room for the heavier 1,760lb bomb and had rocket boosters for either help with takeoff or a final boost before the crash. Other variants include the recon version of the Model 12 and night fighter versions of the Models 12 and 33, which featured upwards firing 20mm cannons but no radar, so it left much to be desired. In total, 2000 planes were built.

* Takashige Egusa was deeply involved in the development of Suisei for his valuable experience in dive bombing and to create a dive bomber he found satisfactory. 
* Although it can be equipped on CVLs in KanColle, the Suisei's high take-off and landing speed made it unsuitable for operation from smaller carriers due to the long flight deck required. Late model planes had to use RATO rockets to take-off properly from the Chiyoda and Hiyou-class.
* Like other Japanese planes, it was heavily hampered by the lack of armor. The Model 54 was under development in the final months of the war that addressed the armor issue and use the Homare engine.
