|en = These 16-inch dual guns were the first main guns used by the American-built Big Seven, the Colorado class. Three battleships from this class made up a section of the Big Seven, alongside Japan's Nagato and Mutsu, and the Land of Black Tea's Nelson class. The name ship Colorado, as well as her younger sisters who were destroyed once at Pearl Harbor and then refloated, thrust themselves into the war on the Pacific Ocean.
