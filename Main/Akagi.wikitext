==Character==
[[File:Akagi-anime.png|thumb|right]]
===Appearance===
*Akagi has long brown hair flowing down straightly. She wears a chest protector (''muneate'') over white and red clothes and wields a bow and arrows. Her flight decks, one on right arm and another around her waist, features katakana ア(''A''), referring to her real-life identification mark.
===Personality===
*Akagi is shown as a compassionate woman with a gentle, easy-going personality. She is a foil to Kaga, behaving openly and cheerfully; whereas Kaga often is seen with little to no emotion around others.
*A personality quirk notable with Akagi is her gluttonous side; most notably seen in the anime, when she will usually consume a larger portion of food than other kanmusu. Lots of fan art of Akagi depicts her gluttonous side and show her voracious appetite.
===Appearances in derivative works===
*Akagi was one of the first characters confirmed to appear in the anime adaptation of Kantai Collection, and was also featured in the adaptation's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABZN292gvRo first trailer].
* Sings "Akatsuki No Suiheisen Ni" with Shoukaku in music album KanColle Vocal Collection (Vol.1).
* In the CCG [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei%C3%9F_Schwarz Weiß Schwarz] by Bushiroad, a special version of Akagi is available as a bonus character for the KanColle deck by purchasing more than 4 packs from a certain vendor. The quote on her card is "ボーキサイトの女王と呼んだ人は誰ですか？" which works out as "Who's the one calling me the Queen of Bauxite?" and her card title is "いらっしゃいませ! 赤城" which translates as "Welcome, Akagi!". She also has very different character art.
==Trivia==
===Akagi CG===
*Her moderate/heavily damaged CG is based on her historical damage condition after being attacked in the Battle of Midway, just like everyone else in the 1st and 2nd Carrier Division. Which was one hit near central elevator and a near miss off her stern (which caused her unable to move by herself) that was moved onto the flight deck on the CG. 
*Dubbed the "Queen of Bauxite" thanks to her reputation for eating up all the Bauxite reserves. Despite her rarity she's fairly accessible via an early quest, causing many new coming admirals to be shocked at her Bauxite-binging and long repair times.
**Another explanation for the "Bauxite Queen" title: during early gameplay, there is a bug that made the aircraft carriers to resupply all of its planes instead of only the planes that was shot down resulting in a large amount of bauxite being consumed after each sortie, which has since been fixed. At that time, Akagi was the only fleet carrier available to most players due to most carrier-dropping areas were yet to be implemented.

===Akagi as a ship===
*Scuttled on June 5th, 1942 by IJN destroyers [[Arashi]], [[Hagikaze]], [[Maikaze]], and [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Nowaki Nowaki] after being heavily [http://www.midway42.org/TheBattle/Images/Akagi-Bomb-Hits.png damaged] by dive bombers from USS Enterprise. 
*Originally designed as an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amagi-class_battlecruiser Amagi-class Battlecruiser], Akagi was converted to a carrier after the instigation of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1921.
*She was the first Fleet Carrier commissioned by Japan. (Kaga was launched before Akagi, but was commissioned after her).
*Her name literally means "Red Castle", and comes from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Akagi Mount Akagi] in Gunma Prefecture, Japan.
*She shares her name with one of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya-class_gunboat Maya-class Gunboats] from the 1880s.
* Akagi was the flagship carrier during Pearl Harbor attack.
