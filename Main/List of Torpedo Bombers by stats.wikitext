==Note==
*All these planes do not attack installation type enemies in the opening air strike and can at most deal scratch damage on them.
*According to ISBN 9784047305533, these planes needed to fly over the surface to drop the torpedo, so they are especially vulnerable when used without Air Superiority. However, it is not clear if it is referring to the game or reality.
*In reference to the note above, there is a chance that it may be referring to the game, as it is shown in the anime's first episode that the torpedo bombers from Akagi flew somewhat parallel to the water surface, and in episode 5 it is shown that the torpedo bombers from Zuikaku are flying parallel above the water surface, but they are not seen dropping the torpedoes as they were shot down before they had a chance to drop the torpedoes.
