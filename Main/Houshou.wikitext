==Character==
===Appearance===
* Like some other carriers, her attire is based on kyūdo (Japanese archery) equipment. She wears a scarlet ''kimono'', a dark ''hakama'', and a matching ''tasuki'' (a rope to tuck up the kimono sleeves to prevent them from getting in the way). She holds a bow with her left hand, and wears a ''yugake'' (deerskin glove) on her right hand. Her flight deck is attached to her left arm. She has a set of arrows on her back with the Japanese aircraft insignia (red circle) on the arrow fletchings.

===Personality===
* Hōshō (Houshou) was the world's first commissioned ship that was designed and built as an aircraft carrier (Other carriers in her days were conversions from other types of ships). For this reason, she can be considered to be the "mother" of all carriers and is given a very motherly, reserved and caring personality.

* Her quotes also suggest that she is a stereotypical "good wife" of the old days. You can bet she's a good cook too; in fact, [[Chitose]] Carrier Kai 2's hourly line on 7 pm indicates that she runs a restaurant or possibly, an ''izakaya'' (something like a pub or a bar).

==Trivia==
*Her name literally translates as "phoenix in flight" (鳳=phoenix, 翔=soar/fly).
*Hoshou was the first IJN carrier, and the first vessel in the world that was designed and built as an aircraft carrier, not converted.
*Lowest consumption out of all the carriers, which is good for expeditions.
*Her arrows have orange-yellow fletchings as opposed to the white and green arrow fletchings of other carriers. This is a reference to the IJN's way of painting its training aircraft, a bright yellow or orange color such as [[Prototype Nanzan]].
* She served as a repatriation transport to retrieve Japanese servicemen and civilians stationed overseas and to return them to Japan. During her repatriation mission, she was modified (i.e., her hangars were cut) to carry more passengers to continue her repatriation trips. She ultimately carried transports of about 40,000 passengers before she was scrapped.
**Scrapping began September 2, 1946 after the mission of repatriations was over.
* Participated in the Battle of Midway with the task of providing modest air protection, scouting, and anti-submarine support to the Main Body (consisting of [[Yamato]], [[Nagato]], [[Mutsu]]).
*A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka_B4Y Yokosuka B4Y 'Jean'] from Houshou took aerial photographs of a burning Hiryuu on June 5th 1942 after the Battle of Midway.
*She would have had a sister ship, the IJN Shokaku, which was cancelled in 1922 according to the Washington Naval Treaty; Shoukaku was used for the new Fleet Carrier class following Hiryuu and Soryuu instead.
