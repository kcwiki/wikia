===Tips===
* A fleet with CVL is recommended as that may give you (upwards of 60%) a chance take on the south route (A → K). A fleet without CVL gives you a lesser chance with the same south route.<sup class="plainlinks">[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/File:World_2-4_branching_rule_tests.png citation]</sup>
* If you are aiming for the boss node to clear the map and failed to take the A-F route, it is recommended to just end the sortie, unless you have an AO ([[Hayasui]] or [[Kamoi|Kamoi normal/Kai Bo]]) in the fleet, with at least one can of [[Underway Replenishment]] equipped.
** A-F route will guarantee you a boss fight and take only 3 fight before boss node because node G will always be avoid battle node if your fleet comes from node F.
** On the other hand, A-B-C-D-G route is impossible for boss clear without resupplying on the way. Approaching G node from D node will result in enemy encounter (red node) and you will run out of fuel and ammo (5 battles) by the time you get to boss node, causing you to do only scratch damage. If you still wish to continue, for highest EXP gain, end the sortie around the G-H/-I node.
***Of course, having a fleet oiler in the fleet would be a different story. Reaching the boss node will prompt the activation dialog for Underway Replenishment(s) to be triggered, meaning that regardless of which approach the player's fleet used to reach the boss, their ships will always have the fuel and ammo necessary to fight. Obviously, it goes without saying that the AO has to be equipped with at least one Underway Replenishment for this method to work. Also, the fragility of the ship has to be taken into consideration. Putting her at the flagship position, bringing [[Aerial Combat#Anti-Air Cut In|AACI ships]] to deal with enemy planes in the bombing phase (more often than not they'll successfully hit the flagship, to great effect), or in the most extreme of cases, give her a [[Emergency Repair Personnel]], are the several possible solutions to keep her safe during the sortie.
** The A-K route is an alternative route that can also lead to the boss. The chance of reaching the boss this way however, is lower due to the potential offroutes L-M and O-P.
* A most conventional way to finish 2-4 is using 「BBx4 CVx2」or「BBx3 CVx3」. (BBs are stronger; Modernizing/Leveling them is highly recommended). 「BBx2 CVx4」 may be slightly cheaper for high-level fleets with strong fighters and bombers.
** It is strongly recommended to make use of the [[Combat#.C2.A0Artillery_Spotting_.28Post-Cap_Modifier.29|Artillery spotting]] and [[Combat#Night_Combat|Night Combat]] mechanics to deal higher damage.
* Subs can be a cheap way to clear the map, but will require a lot of patience. This generally involves trying over and over so you can avoid the highly dangerous line abreast formations and get to the boss node. It is possible to clear 2-4 with a single moderately leveled, maxed armor sub. Consider farming 1-5 if you are in need of subs.

===Sample Fleet and Equipment Setup===

Beginners are recommended to try to follow these exact setups as much as possible.
*'''Note to Beginners''': You do not need to gain S-Rank Victory on the Boss node to clear this map. Just obtain rank B or higher victory and you will be able to clear the map.
*The ships do not have to be the exactly the same ship as listed in the sample.
**Ex. {{ShipLink|Kongou Kai}} who is in the sample can be {{ShipLink|Kirishima Kai}} instead, or {{ShipLink|Nagato Kai}}, or even {{ShipLink|Hyuuga Kai}}, depending on the Battleship you have in your fleet.

*You are recommended to follow the equipment setup, but exceptions may occur where you might need to equip more fighters or more seaplane bombers for the extra fighter power.
** You need at least 123/246 fighter power to get AS/AS+ respectively assuming you have to go through node H.
