A single-seater fighter modification of the reliable and maneuverable two-seater Ro.43 reconnaissance seaplane used in the country of pasta. There are limits to its fighter ability due to the slow speed, but it was expected to be a valuable maritime air defense asset. It had a limited production run.

* When originally introduced on 24 February 2016, this equipment was introduced as a Seaplane Bomber and behaved as such until the 29 February 2016 update.
** In this period, when equipped on Seaplane Tenders, Aviation Cruisers, Aviation Battleships, etc., the ship would attack enemy subs, but when equipped on remodelled Italian Battleships or Cruisers, either alone or alongside a Seaplane Bomber and/or a [[Type 0 Passive Sonar]], these ships would ignore these targets instead.
