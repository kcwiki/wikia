#Increase amount of available field in equipment index. 
#Preparation for composition interface enhancement.
#Main harbor screen left menu background graphic partial update
#Kanmusu detail screen now show how many experience the kanmusu still needed to reach next level.

==Mini-Event contents==
# This saury/mackerel pike mini-event  is '''NOT''' [[Fall 2015 Event]].
# Mackerel pikes '''WILL DISAPPEAR''' after the mini-event has been concluded. Unlike [[Hishimochi]] mini-event players can receive special item(s) together with kanmusu(s).
#* However, by applying the "Kabayaki" cooking method onto those Mackerel Pike, you can obtain [[Canned Mackerel]] which can be preserved for a long time. So please grab one or two of these Mamiya and Akashi made cans to commemorate the festival.
#* During the festival you can only have at most 99 of them at the same time.
# Ensure safety of fisheries to support fishing for [[Mackerel|Mackerel Pike Festival]]. (Note: This is something like the past [[Hishimochi]] mini event. Simply speaking, some maps would drop these specific items beside ships during this period of time and you can collect them for something else.)
# This festival will last for three (3) weeks
#* [[Mackerel|'''Fisheries''']]
#** Obtainable from mainly world 3 as well as world 1 Extra Operations, 
#** S rank is required for most nodes but A rank is also ok for World 3.
#** Drop rates would vary greatly from node to node and are not specific to just boss nodes.
#** Farmable fisheries (nodes) will have a special background music named as 鎮守府秋刀魚祭り.
#** For those who have access to world 3, please go world 3.
#** In world 1, you can support fishing Mackerel pike from 1-5 and thereafter.
#** See [[Mackerel]] page for a list of nodes that drop them.
#* '''Other Mackerel-pike-dropping nodes:'''
#** Certain point/nodes in 1-1 (1-1-B, the non-boss terminal node on the top) would drop Mackerel pike with a rare chance, however they are not considered as fisheries and thus no special background music will be played.
# '''Other fishing notes as well as other mini-event related notes:'''
#* Kanmusu equipped with relevant equipments can produce a synergy effect on the whole fleet.
#** For example, those equipment they can detect them, collect them, and/or find them.
#** Using different equipment together would give multiple synergy effect.
#* Stacking lots of them into your fleet can drastically increase fishing output but putting too many of those equipments into your fleet would reduce your fleet's day battle "anti-surface" firepower. So it is important to find a good balance between your fleet so that it would be enough to eliminate threats and it is the key for a good catch.
#* Overfishing '''would''' reduce fish's obtain rate so please bear that in mind.
#* Cooking them would give like development material, improvement material, and so on. But it will require a specific amounts to exchange for them.
#* After successfully carried out support on Mackerel pike fishing and collected tons of Mackerel pike good catach, you can get a "Kantai [[:wikipedia:Tairyō-bata]]" flag made by [[Ikazuchi]]. It would not have any special function.
#* Read [[Mackerel#Exchange]] for further detail about cooking these mackerel pikes.
# Mackerel pike Festival seasonal graphic:
#* [[Isokaze/Gallery|Isokaze]] (Base and Kai), [[Akebono/Gallery|Akebono]], [[Murasame/Gallery|Murasame]] and [[Ushio/Gallery|Ushio]] (Base/Kai and Kai Ni)
#* [[Ooyodo]] as NPC
#* [[Northern Princess|Northern Hime]] at [[World_3#World_3-5_.E3.80.90Extra_Operation.E3.80.91_.E5.8C.97.E6.96.B9AL.E6.B5.B7.E5.9F.9F_Aleutian_Islands_Campaign|World 3-5]]
# '''[[Seasonal/Fall_2015|Autumn Voice Lines]]''' for [[Ushio]], [[Murasame]] and [[Isokaze]]
# [[Isokaze]] droppable in World 2/5/6 during the festival and also 1-5 and 1-6 for those who doesn't have her yet.
# Addition of function to prepare/cook Mackerel pike
# Addition of Mackerel pike festival furniture
