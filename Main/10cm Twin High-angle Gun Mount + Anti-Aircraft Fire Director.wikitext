The "Long 10cm cannon" in combination with the  "Type 94 Fire Director anti-aircraft equipment", creates this state-of-the-art fleet air defense system. Unable to be mass produced however, the firepower is heavily depended on the gun, but the combination of the excellent 10cm high-angle guns and anti-aircraft equipment can fully serve as an Anti-air-guardian of the fleet.

*Can be used to enable [[Combat/Aerial Combat#Anti-Air Cut-In|Anti-Air Cut-In (AACI)]] when paired with other equipment.
