<!--
=== Appearance ===
-->
=== Personality ===
* Her personality goes all over the place. Sometimes, she's a genuinely nice girl; other times, she trolls Abukuma. She often expresses her annoyance with the Destroyers. She is also likely to boast her abilities, such as refering herself as "Super Kitakami-sama" after remodeling.
** Despite the fact that she says she hates destroyers often, in the anime, she still helped Fubuki by teaching her about torpedoes.[[File:Kitakami-sensei.png|thumb|Kitakami teaching Fubuki about torpedo, ignoring Ooi's disagreement]]
* The nature of her relationship with Ooi varies but they are usually very close to each other.

==Trivia==
*Her name is taken from the "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitakami_River Kitakami River]".
**Isuzu class destroyer escort JDS Kitakami had been commissioned to Maritime Self Defense Force (1961-1992), inheriting the name.
*After being remodeled into torpedo cruisers, Kitakami, [[Ooi]] and [[Kiso]] can equip Type-A [[Kouhyouteki]] to fire [[Combat#Combat_Stages|opening torpedoes]] before shelling phase.
* In 1942 she and Ooi were converted into fast transports to perform escort missions during the war. Nearly two years after her conversion, and after being out of action for six months having been torpedoed by HMS Templar, she was again converted, this time into a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiten Kaiten] carriers to carry Kaiten craft suicide subs for sea trials. 
* She served on the repatriation service after the war as the repair tender ship on repatriation duties.
*Scrapped 10 August 1946.
