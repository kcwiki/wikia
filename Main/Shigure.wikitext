|Introduction = 僕は白露型駆逐艦、「時雨」。これからよろしくね。
|Introduction/En = I'm Shigure, of the Shiratsuyu-class destroyers. Nice to meet you.

|Library = 僕は白露型駆逐艦2番艦の時雨だよ。<br>あのレイテ沖海戦では、西村艦隊に所属して、運命のスリガオ海峡に突入したんだ。<br>扶桑も山城も凄かったよ……。<br>皆が忘れても、僕だけはずっと覚えているから……。
|Library/En = I'm Shigure, second ship of the Shiratsuyu-class destroyers.<br>I was in the fated battle of Surigao Strait under the Nishimura fleet in the battle of Leyte Gulf.<br>Fusou and Yamashiro were amazing...<br>Even if everyone forgets, I'll always remember them...

|Secretary 2 = いい雨だね。
|Secretary 2/En = What comfortable rain.

|Secretary 3 = 僕に興味があるの？　…いいよ。なんでも聞いてよ。
|Secretary 3/En = You're interested in me? ... Sure. You can ask whatever you'd like.

|Wedding/En = The rain… looks like it won't stop. Admiral, you'll get soaked over there, you know? Why don’t you come a little closer. Until the rain lifts, let's stay like this.

|Equipment 2/Note = The Oxygen Torpedo is the Japanese colloquial name for their Type 93 torpedo (known as the 'Long Lance' by the Americans), referring to its propulsion system that used pure oxygen rather than compressed air as the fuel oxidizer. It was considered one of the most advanced torpedoes of the war.

==Character==
===Appearance===
* For her Kai Ni character design, the artist mentioned that her "ear-like flaps" were drawn from the image of the "faithful hound (忠犬)". Compare with [[Yuudachi]].
* Because of how her equipment appears, she is nicknamed ''Guncannon'' from Mobile Suit Gundam.
* Her hair ornament in her Kai Ni design looks strikingly similar to the ornaments on [[Fusou|Fusou Kai]] and [[Yamashiro|Yamashiro Kai]]'s aviation decks, but her artist declined to make a proper declaration on this and said to [https://twitter.com/kujouitiso/status/393030142202626048 'leave it to your own imagination'].

===Personality===
* She uses 僕 (boku) to address herself. '''Boku''' was mostly reserved for boys, and very rare among Japanese young girls, but is considered to be ''very'' cute when used by the latter.
* Sometimes paired with Yamashiro as she provided cover (and sunk as a result) for Shigure to escape the ''Battle of Leyte Gulf''.
* Some suggest that Shigure might have PTSD over night battles, inferring from her quotes.
** According to history, both battles (Battle of Vella Gulf and Battle of Leyte Gulf), in which she lost all of her comrades (and in the case of Vella Gulf, [[Kawakaze|her own little sister]]), occurred during the night.
** As a result, her tone and speech is reserved, somewhat demure and more saddened compared to most other kanmusu, although she is not without a positive side.
** After the Final Battle 2017 event, Shigure gets notably more cheerful in her new seasonal lines after overcoming her traumas over the Battle of Surigao Strait, implying she's moving on.

==Trivia==
* Her name means ''drizzling rain'' (in late autumn and early winter).
** It was first carried by the tenth Torpedo Boat Destroyer of the First Kamikaze class in 1906.
* Received her Kai Ni on [[Second Remodel Timeline|23/10/2013]].
* Shigure was known as one of the lucky ships of the war, sometimes referred to as ''Shigure of Sasebo'', similarly as ''[[Yukikaze]] of Kure''.
**  During the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Vella_Gulf|Battle of Vella Gulf]], she was the only destroyer to survive from the surprise torpedo salvos because the torpedo that hit her rudder did not explode.
** During the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf|Battle of Leyte Gulf]], Battle of Surigao Strait, she pulled through hails of shell in front, while the rest of [[Quests#A44|Nishimura Force]] was sunk. Then she fled and became the sole survivor. Bizarrely her captain did not inform Shima's secondary force that there was an American ambush in wait - effectively letting him be wiped out.
** During the [[wikipedia:Operation_Hailstone|Operation HailStone]], She suffered heavy damage from an air raid on Truk by United States Navy aircraft, taking a direct bomb hit to her No.2 gun turret,reducing her maximum speed to 25 knots.
** During the Night Battle With TaskForce 75, 6-inch shell hit her fuel tank, but it did not explode.
** On account of this, her second remodel has very high luck.
* Sunk in action 7:15 (JST) 24 January 1945 near [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Bharu Kota Bharu], Malaya (now Malaysia) ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Shigure&params=06_00_N_103_48_E_ 06°00′N 103°48′E]).

== Quests ==
*Composition: [[Quests#A22|A22]], [[Quests#A44|A44]].
*Sortie: [[Quests#B14|B14]], [[Quests#B33|B33]].
