==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* Kumano has long brown hair in a ponytail and blue eyes. Like Suzuya, she wears a brown school uniform with an orange neckerchief on her collar and a brown dress with white frills. She wears gray shoes with gray heels, and her main cannon is attached to a bandolier worn around her body. Anti-air cannons are seen on the sleeves of her uniform. She has a hair piece with two rods sticking out the side.
** On remodeling into an aviation cruiser, she gains a flight deck which is attached to her left arm.
*After her second remodel, she wears a slightly updated version of the outfit she wore pre-second remodel, with a different dress, tan blouse and a brown jacket. She retains her orange bow on her collar and head ornament, and has a patch with the Imperial Chrysanthemum Logo on her jacket. She has darker brown stockings and shoes with red rudders acting as heels, and her weapons include a new hand-held main gun and improved turrets attached to the side of her stockings. She retains her deck, although it now has a bandolier which is worn around her body as opposed to being attached to her left arm. When moderately damaged, it is revealed that she wears white panties.
**On remodeling into a "carrier", her weapons change; she changes her main gun in favor of a repeating crossbow à la [[Taihou]]'s, ditches her stocking-mounted turrets in favor of anti-air guns, and replaces her aviation cruiser deck in favor of a bigger deck à la the ones used by most carriers. When she is moderately damaged, it is revealed she wears black panties. Other than that, her outfit remains the same.

=== Personality ===
* Kumano acts very formally, liking to act very grandly and uses very formal phrases, somewhat like [[Mikuma]]. She is known for squealing like a dolphin and seems to take a liking to sandwiches.

==Trivia==
*She was added earlier than planned because the [[I-19]] voice records were missing, thus couldn't be introduced in time.
*Buildable as of 16 October 2013.
*Sunk on 25 November 1944 off the coast of [[wikipedia:Santa_Cruz,_Zambales|Santa Cruz, Zambales, Philippines]] . Currently resting upside-down in 108 ft. of water.
**Namesake was passed down twice: To a cold-war destroyer escort, and the latest, to one of the newest stealth frigate in the JMSDF. (FM-2) Her latest nameclass designation is currently unrevealed due to the nameship still being under construction in Nagasaki.
