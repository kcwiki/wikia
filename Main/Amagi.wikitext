==Character==

===Appearance===
* She has long brown hair with uneven-length bangs. She also has a maple leaf hair ornament on her left temple. She has brown eyes as well as a beauty mark below her left eye. Like her sister, she has large breasts.
* Unremodelled, she wears a patterned furisode with her flight deck in guise of a obi (as it is simply too short, a clip-on bow is attached to it) and her banner-rod is wrapped on her back. This actually represents how she wasn't given any planes and was camouflaged in Kure, never to be used in any meaningful way. When damaged, she has a distinctive and unusual pose lying down upon her side, revealing her Unryuu-class gear underneath the furisode.
* Remodelled, she wears the Unryuu-class uniform without Unryuu's cloud patterning. She finally wields her banner-rod, adorned with a kagura suzu, like her elder sister. When damaged, her pose was once the same as her unremodeled form, but this was later changed to a more standard damage pose.

=== Personality ===
* By her spoken in-game lines, Amagi has a high-strung, yet still "mature woman" personality, with a lack of confidence in her abilities and constant worry about air attacks. Her depiction in doujin works tend to run more towards the Yamato Nadeshiko end of the spectrum, focusing upon the personality implied by her unusually ornate and formal clothing in her unremodeled state.
==Notes==
* [[Winter 2015 Event]], E-5 clear reward.
* [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Winter_2016_Event Winter 2016 Event], E-2 Boss Drop (Easy+)
* [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Fall_2016_Event Fall 2016 Event], E-3 Boss Drop (Easy+)

* [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Summer_2017_Event Summer 2017 Event], E-3 Boss Drop (Easy+)
* [[Fall 2019 Event]], E-3 Boss Drop (Casual+)

==Trivia==
* Departing from the name scheme of the lead ship [[Unryuu]], as they were a modified version of [[Hiryuu]], Amagi & her following sisters utilized the defunct battlecruiser naming scheme.
** That is, instead of dragon-based names, they had mountain names.
** ''Amagi'' was last used for the Amagi class Battlecruisers, of which [[Akagi]] was a part of.
*** To wit, Amagi class Battlecruiser ''Amagi'' & Unryuu class Aircraft Carrier ''Amagi'' are thoroughly different ships. <!-- ** The first ''Amagi'' was a corvette, the sole member of her class. -->
* Although she was commissioned, she has never possessed an air wing due to losses during the war & as such, never traveled far from a port.
** The ''[[Equipment_Ranking|601 Air Group]]'' were slated to be her air wing, if not for their deployment in the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Iwo_Jima|''Battle of Iwo Jima'']]''.''
** She was permanently moored at an island in [[wikipedia:Kure_Naval_Base|Kure Harbor]] & extensively camouflaged on April 13th, 1945 after light damage sustained from [[:wikipedia:Task_Force_58|Task Force 58]].
* Capsized on July 28th, 1945 by [[:wikipedia:Task_Force_38|Task Force 38]] due to attacks on July 24th & July 28th. Her damage was not repaired & she capsized at her moorings.
** It was the same fleet with different command staff.

{{MultiTweet
|MultiTweetID = amagidesign
|user = ku_ro_kuro
|color = #ace
|title = Amagi's Design
|link01 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/564594762695454722
|JP01 = 航空母艦天城は三菱長崎造船所で起工されました。<br />天城は雲龍の図面を転用して作られた為外見がほぼ同じですが、機銃のプラットホームが全て角型になるなど簡略化が更に進んでいます。<br />また、機関は改鈴谷型重巡から流用して雲龍と同出力になるように構成されました。
|EN01 = The Standard Aircraft Carrier Amagi began at Mitsubishi Nagasaki Shipyard. Amagi was created with a modified version of Unryuu's blueprints so her outer appearance is roughly the same but she had various simplifications such as her machine gun platforms all being rectangular.<br />Also, her engine was recycled from a modified Suzuya-class heavy cruiser and configured to have the same output as Unryuu.
|link02 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/564594854844325889
|JP02 = 竣工後、第一航空戦隊に編成、瀬戸内海で松山基地の601航空隊と共に航空戦隊としての訓練をしていましたが、程なく第一航空戦隊は解体。<br />601航空隊は基地航空隊となり、天城は搭載する筈だった母艦航空隊を失い、呉鎮守府所属艦になりました。
|EN02 = After her construction completed, she was assigned to the first carrier division and trained together with the 601 air group at Matsuyama Base at the Seto Inland Sea but the first carrier division was dissolved shortly after.<br />The 601 air group served as the base's air force and Amagi who was supposed to load them, having lost her carrier fleet, was assigned to the Kure Naval District.
|link03 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/569680809566691329
|JP03 = ●天城初期<br />着物姿は三ツ子島に擬装繋留されていた姿を表現しています<br />天城改の鉄ブラ、手蓋、服等の上に擬装（着物）を付けています。<br />着物の柄に松の木、道路、土、擬装網等、擬装に使われた物を取り入れています。
|EN03 = Initial Amagi<br />Her kimono represents her camouflaged appearance while anchored at Mitsugo Island.<br />Amagi Kai's iron bra, gauntlet and clothing have her camouflage (kimono) applied.<br />On her kimono's design are pine trees, roads, land and camouflage netting which are incorporated into the camouflage.
|link04 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/569680988608946178
|JP04 = 乗せられた擬装の為に甲板の機能は妨げられていましたので、甲板は帯に。旗竿は袋に収納されています。<br />繋留時は第4種予備艦となっていた為人員は最低限しかおらず、浸水に対するダメージコントロールができずに徐々に傾き、転覆しました。<br />ですので下の防御力を下げる表現で脚の鎧は外してます。
|EN04 = Because of her camouflage, her deck's functionality was hampered so it was made into her obi. Her flagpole is stored in a bag.<br />When she was moored, there were 4 types of reserve ships so she only had the bare minimum of personnel and could not perform damage control to prevent flooding, leading her to gradually tilt and she capsized.
|link05 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/569681230641246208
|JP05 = 初期天城の絵は後ろに隠していた腰艤装を前に展開させる途中のイメージです。<br />開幕戦の画面の暗さに溶け込んだら面白いかと思い、暗めに塗ってます。
|EN05 = The rigging hiding in the back and attached to the waist of the initial Amagi is shown in the process of being deployed.<br />I thought it might be interesting if it were to meld into the darkness of the opening screen, so I made it dark.
|link06 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/569682481936347137
|JP06 = 初期天城で胸が大きいのは着膨れです。
|EN06 = The Amagi's breasts appears to be larger in her initial form due to the piling of clothes.
|link07 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/569692351653785600
|JP07 = 初期天城の帯ですが、普通の着物の帯の長さは4メートル近いので人が持てる幟程度の長さだと全然足りません。<br />なので、背中の結びは結んである形に作られたものをポンと付けているフェイクです。中破の時に留め金がちょっと見えます。
|EN07 = In regards to the initial Amagi's obi, a regular kimono's obi is around 4 metres long so it's really short of being streamer length that people can carry.<br />That being so, I just went ahead and made a fake that looks like it's tied at the back. The clasp is slightly visible in her damaged art.
|link08 = https://twitter.com/ku_ro_kuro/status/569680678536638464
|JP08 = 髪飾りは楓と結袈裟の房
|EN08 = Her hair accessory is from a maple tree and the bound section of a kasaya.
