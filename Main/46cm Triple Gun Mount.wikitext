Officially the largest caliber guns ever equipped on warships. In the real world, it was purpose-built and equipped only on the Yamato-class, but in the KanColle world, even the Kongou-class can carry this (but will suffer [[Combat/Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus|accuracy penalties]]). After the war, the technology used to rotate this turret was applied to the mechanics of a revolving restaurant on top of Hotel New Otani. The lathe used to machine the barrel of 46 cm guns are still active today at Kure.
* This is also the only main cannon other than the [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount]] that provides an additional bonus to fleet anti-air defense.
* This cannon has overweight penalties when used on all battleships except for Yamato class, which severely decreases accuracy. It is advised not to use two or more in a combined fleet because of the augmentation of accuracy penalties in combined fleets.
* The 46 cm gun turret weighs nearly 2800 tons each, which is heavier than the Akizuki-class at standard displacement.
