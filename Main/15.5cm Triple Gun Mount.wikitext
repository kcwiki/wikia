Developed to cover the absence of heavy cruisers, which were restricted under naval treaty, by deploying light cruisers with enhanced firepower.<br/>It was the first 3-gun turret, highly rated in every aspects such as range, firing rate and actual operation.<br/>Was later equipped as secondary guns for Yamato class.<br/>Could be used in anti-air firing as well.

|notes = 
* Ooyodo is the only CL that benefits from fit bonuses from this gun. Some CAs (probably Mogami and possibly Tone class) also see unknown bonuses.

|trivia = 
Equipped by Mogami-class cruisers before they were converted into heavy cruisers by swapping their gun into [[20.3cm Twin Gun Mount|20.3 cm]] turrets. The Mogami-class was designed as a heavy cruiser, but the naval treaty at the time defined cruiser types by main gun caliber so it was a sort of regulation loophole. The other ships that also equip this are the Yamato-class battleship and the Ooyodo-class light cruiser, while the Tone-class heavy cruisers were originally planned to use these guns.
