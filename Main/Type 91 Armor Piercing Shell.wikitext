The long range bombardment weapon known as the secret weapon "Type 91 Armor Piercing Shell".<br/>This type of ammunition will spin rapidly after exiting the the gun's barrel, enters the water, and penetrate the target's armor below the waterline like a torpedo, crushing the hull of the ships.<br/>The shell's shape enhances underwater penetration while also improving the range by decreasing air resistance.<br/>Can be used on Battleships, Aviation Battleships, etc.
