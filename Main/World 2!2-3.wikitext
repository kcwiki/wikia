===Recommendations===
*'''1 XX 1 CL 4 DD''' or '''1 CL 5 CA''' are the only two comps that guarantees the boss routing. Otherwise, any other fleets should be able to reach the boss node most of the times as long as CL+DD ≥ 4
**Bring at least one AV, CV(B/L) or CL to avoid chance of off-routing from {{Event/Route|F|Red}} to {{Event/Route|H|Green}}.
**Bringing more heavy ships ((F)BB(V)/CV(L/B)) will reduce the chances of reaching the boss.
