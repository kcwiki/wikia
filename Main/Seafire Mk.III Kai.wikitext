"Spitfire," the iconic, main fighter from the country of black tea. A carrier-based version of the famous aircraft that splendidly defended the homeland and its skies in the Battle of Britain. Mass-produced in the latter half of the war, this is the Spitfire that was equipped by British carriers, called "Seafire". This is the implementation of an improved version of that plane.

*Despite the superb handling of the Spitfire, the Seafire was let down by limited range and weak under carriage limiting it's use as a carrier fighter. However it proved to be a decent CAP plane for Britain's carrier operations against Japan. Some were also modified with spare drop tanks, which greatly increased the range.
*Postwar variants would be among the finest prop planes produced, although jets were already becoming the norm.
*The plane portrayed here is in British Pacific Fleet style, where the normal roundels were replaced with a modified version of the US one, to avoid confusion with the Japanese roundel.
