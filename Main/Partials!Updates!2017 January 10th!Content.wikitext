{{#if:{{{thread|}}}||''For a full debriefing on the game update (including developer tweets), you may wish to refer to [[Partials/Updates/2017_January_{{Ordinal|10}}|this link]].''}}

===Summary===
* [[Improved Kanhon Type Turbine]] can now be equipped in [[Reinforcement Expansion]] slots
* New speed classes: Fast+ (高速+) and Fastest (最速)
* [[Partials/Speed system|Engine enhancement synergy]]: if you equip a turbine and one or more boilers, the ship girl's speed can be increased
** The resulting speed depends on equipped boilers and vary for each ship girl, as they have different speed characteristics
** Allows to upgrade Slow (低速) speed to Fast (高速). However, that doesn't change the ship type, slow [[BB]] and [[BBV]] can have Fast speed, but still aren't [[FBB]], so they still can't be used in the [[Combined Fleet]] escort fleet and don't count as [[FBB]] for branching
*** For instance, in [[Fall_2016_Event/E-3|Fall Event E3]], a fleet with Fast [[Nagato]] (synergy setup) in the main fleet can go from B to E if other requirements are met
*** But in [[2-5]], if you put Fast [[Nagato]] together with 3 [[FBB]] and 2 [[CV]] into the fleet, it will always go to dead end, as the amount of [[FBB]] in the fleet is still 3
** A fleet including ships with speed higher than fast is still a fast fleet
** Currently, ships with speed higher than fast only have evasion gain, in future there will be maps and situations in which they can be effective<sup>[https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/818739607776804866]</sup>
* New improvable equipment
** [[Enhanced Kanhon Type Boiler]] is now improvable and upgradable into [[New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler]]
** [[F4F-4]] is now upgradable into [[F6F-3]], [[F6F-3]] is now improvable
* DD stats upgrade
