*On 12 September 2017,[[Partials/Updates/2017 September 12th/Content|Post Summer 2017 Event]], developers implemented Aircraft Carrier "Fighter & Bomber Combination" Cut-in Attack (CVCI).
*Currently, these are the combination that are now available for Cut in Attacks:
**1) Fighter Bomber Attacker
**2) Bomber Bomber Attacker
**3) Bomber Attacker
*[[Ship_Class#Light_Aircraft_Carrier_.28CVL.29|Light Carriers]] ,[[Ship_Class#Regular_Aircraft_Carrier_.28CV.29|Standard Carriers]] and [[Ship_Class#Armored_Aircraft_Carrier_.28CVB.29|Armored Carriers]] are the ones able to utilize Cut-In attacks during Day Battle, depending on the types of Aircraft equipped.
**It is also made mandatory that a bomber has to be in a slot regardless of their position in that carrier in order for the cut in to take place
**Certain Abyssal Aircraft Carriers (Example, [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class]] are able to utilize the cut in as well.)
*Certain Aircraft Carriers who are specialized for Night Battle like [[Saratoga|Saratoga Mk.II]] or Aircraft Carriers who are equipped with [[Night_Operation_Aviation_Personnel| Night Operation Aviation Personnel]] or [[Night Operation Aviation Personnel + Skilled Deckhands]], will be able to utilize the Cut-In attack as well during Night Battle depending on the types of Aircraft equipped.
*[[Partials/Updates/2017_October_18th|18 October 2017]], CVCI has been updated to allow Aircraft's Proficiency to determine the Attack Success Rate/Critical Attack Success Rate/Critical Damage Output and etc.
*The first slot bomber will also increase the attack success rate depending on its proficiency.
