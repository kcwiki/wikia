==Character==
===Appearance===
<!--* The rig from her first two forms seems representative of her historical armament, including a 14cm 3rd Year Type main gun and double torpedo launchers around her ankles.-->

===Personality===
* She ends nearly all her sentences with kuma.

==Trivia==
* She is named after the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuma_River_(Japan) Kuma River].
*Laid down on 29 August 1918, launched 14th July '19 and commissioned on 31th August '20.
*Immediately after her working up she was sent	to support Japanese forces fighting the Bolshevik Russian forces in	Siberia. After a refit in 1934 she supported forces now fighting in	China before fulfilling her designed role as the flagship of a submarine force for a year.
*With Japan's entry into the war she was part of the Philippines covering force, and supported forces for the next few months as the island was slowly captured. She survived attacks	from B17s and PT boats unscathed and sank numerous small transports.
*Following this she carried out transport and	patrol runs around the Dutch East Indies and New Guinea before	having a refit to improve her AA in Nov '43.
*She met her end in January of '44 when she	was spotted off Penang by ''HMS Tally-Ho'' who managed to hit her with two torpedoes causing her to slow and list. Unfortunately for her a deck fire had started and spread to her depth charges, causing a massive explosion which tore the stern off and rapidly sank her. ''[[Uranami]]'' rescued survivors.
*Like other ships sunk in the area her wreck has been mostly destroyed by illegal salvage.
*Her Kai Ni D rig appears to be based loosely on the Kaiten carrier form of Kitakami, which would explain the similar uniform. Kuma Kai Ni D is able to equip Type-A Kouhyouteki to fire an opening torpedo salvo. She can also equip Daihatsu landing craft, but looses the ability to carry aircraft.
*It is possible the "D" in Kai Ni D is a reference to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsu-class_destroyer Type D Destroyers]. Such was the case for Asashio Kai Ni D, who is clearly based off of them. Though this destroyer class did have Type 89 guns and some were converted to Kaiten carriers, their appearance does not match Kuma. Her Kai Ni D form has a different version of the Type 89 gun that looks more akin to what Kitakami had historically after being converted to a Kaiten carrier. Furthermore, the submarine launch deck as two parallel tracks, like Kitakami. The D-Class kaiten carriers had a single track down the center.
*Received her Kai Ni on 1/13/2021
