===Seasonal Quotes===
{{Ship/SeasonalQuotes}}

==Character==
===Appearance===
* She has short, light-blue hair with double buns and yellow eyes, wears a sailor's hat with a star ribbon decoration. The star decoration is a reference to her earning one battle star for her World War II service.
* She appears to be carrying a SMG with several empty magazines. The empty magazines could be a reference to her firing more than six hundred 5 inch (127.0 mm) shells to keep the Japanese ships at bay, nearly running out of ammo before she was sank by {{ShipLink|Kongou Kai Ni|text=Kongou}}.
* Her left sleeve bears a Navy Cross medal, in reference to her namesake [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_B._Roberts Coxswain Samuel B. Roberts], who was awarded a posthumous Navy Cross for his actions at the Battle of Guadalcanal, where he voluntarily drove a Higgins boat directly in front of Japanese forces to draw their fire away from boats evacuating surrounded Marines from the beach.
* A small whale can be seen in the rigging of Samuel B. Roberts. The whale with her is a reference to when she encountered a problem on her first day of service. After spending time at Boston Navy Yard, her port propeller shaft struck a large whale 150 NMI (280 km; 170 mi) off the coast of Maine.
* The ends of the ribbon on her hat bear signal flags that spell out the letters '''NTIK''' ([[File:ICS_November.png|16px|link=]] November, [[File:ICS_Tango.png|16px|link=]] Tango, [[File:ICS_India.png|16px|link=]] India, [[File:ICS_Kilo.png|16px|link=]] Kilo). This refers to her historical radio callsign during World War II.<ref>http://www.navsource.org/archives/06/413.htm</ref>

===Personality===

==Notes==
*Equipping Samuel B. Roberts (both base and Kai) with an {{Turbine}} {{EquipmentLink|Improved Kanhon Type Turbine}} will let her become a '''Fast''' Ship.
**Unlike the standard [[Partials/Speed system|Speed System]], she does not require a {{EquipmentLink|New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler|Enhanced Kanhon Type Boiler|text=Boiler}} Equipment to become a Fast Ship.
*Samuel B. Roberts '''Kai''' is capable of using [[Partials/Opening ASW|OASW]] without any {{Sonar}} SONAR or other ASW equipment.

==Trivia==
*The ''USS Samuel B. Roberts'', colloquially nicknamed "Sammy B", is the 46th of the ''John C. Butler'' class of destroyer escorts. Her construction and launching was sponsored by Samuel's widow, Mrs. Roberts.
*Samuel B. Roberts is most famous for her defiant last stand during the Battle of Samar as part of ''Task Force 77.4.3'', aka "Taffy 3", along with [[Gambier Bay]] and [[Johnston]].
* She was assigned to the Atlantic on the beginning of the war. After hitting a whale and receiving some damage, she was refitted, repainted and assigned to the Pacific.
*Two ships have inherited her name, currently retired from service.
** In 1946 the DD-823 a Destroyer of the Gearing-class was named in their honor.
** In 1984 the FFG-58, a Guided Missile Frigate of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class was named in her honor.
