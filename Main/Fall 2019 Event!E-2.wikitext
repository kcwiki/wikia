* Bonuses listed are flat and not multiplicative with each other within the table.
Please be advised {{ShipLink|Yura/Kai Ni|text=Yura}} and {{ShipLink|Ryuujou/Kai Ni|text=Ryuujou}} also have Historical Bonuses in E-4. ('''1.1x''' and '''1.2x''' respectively)

===Phase 1: Opening Shortcut Nodes J to S (OPTIONAL)===
*To open the Shortcut Nodes J to S you must A+ Rank Node {{Event/Route|A|Red}} '''2 Times''' (Casual to Medium only requires Once).
**The Enemy in Node A is {{ShipLink|Harbour Water Demon}}, who is a Soft-Shell Installation Enemy, weak against most standard Anti-Installation Equipment such as {{GreenAmmo}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 3 Shell|Type 3 Shell Kai|text=Type 3 Shell (Kai)}}, {{WG42}} {{EquipmentLink|Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher}} and {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)}}.
**Recommended Fleet: 2 CA(V) 1 CV 1 CL 2 DD '''(Fast Fleet)'''
**Route: {{Event/Route|I|Blue|F|Blue|E|Red|B|Orange|D|Blue|A|Red}}

===Phase 2: Defeat [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]]===
*The Boss is a Single Fleet with a {{ShipLink|Heavy Cruiser Princess}}.
*The Recommended Fleet and Route differs depending on whether you have unlocked the Node J to S Shortcut.
You are recommended to take the option that fits your fleet the most.

====Recommended Fleet If Shortcut NOT Opened====
*Route: {{Event/Route|I|Blue|J|Orange|L|Orange|P|Red|Q|Red|R|Red}}
*Fleet: 2 CA(V) 1 CL(T) 1 CVL 2 DD '''(Any Speed)'''
**This Fleet takes an extra Air Raid Node which results in having 2 Air Raid + 2 Surface Battle before Boss, but allows you to bring Slow Fleet, bring more Medium Ships including a CVL, and be allowed to take only 2 DDs.

====Recommended Fleet if Shortcut Unlocked====
*Route: {{Event/Route|I|Blue|J|Orange|S|Blue|P|Red|Q|Red|R|Red}}
*Fleet: 1 CVL/FBB 1 CL/CLT/CA(V) 4 DD '''(Fast Fleet)'''
**This Fleet skips the 2nd Air Raid Node {{Event/Route|L|Orange}}, taking only 1 Air Raid + 2 Surface Battles before Boss.
**This option allows you to bring a FBB, giving you access to a 2nd Shelling Phase.
***However, you will be required to bring a Fast Fleet and 4 Destroyers, making the fleet slightly weaker and more vulnerable to Retreats, if compared to the above Fleet options if the Shortcut is not unlocked.
