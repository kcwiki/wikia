==Character==
===Appearance===
* Both [[Fusou]] & Yamashiro sport a hair ornament that resembles a pagoda mast as they were widely known for [[wikipedia:Pagoda_mast|pagoda masts]] that stood 40 meters, or 130 feet, above the waterline.
** The height increased the visual spotting range by counteracting the planet's curvature, primarily for the main guns.

===Personality===
* She has a sister complex toward her older sister, Fusou.
* Yamashiro is often complaining about her bad luck and being considered a faulty ship. She cares a lot about Fusou, but is dismissive of the other shipgirls and the Admiral.
* While she's usually sulky and quiet, when leading battle she's surprisingly fierce, powerful, and full of authority. Might be an allusion of her service as the flagship of Nishimura Fleet.
* For some reason she believes that other ships talk things behind her back for being a faulty ship. She's likely acting paranoid.
* As noted in her lines, she cares more for Fusou than the admiral (even her wedding line is a polite rejection). She does open up to the admiral more as she become remodeled, albeit awkwardly. 
* A member of the [http://cerastes.tumblr.com/post/124702504985/from-the-official-kancolle-4koma-the-unlucky-tea 'Unlucky Tea Ceremonies']. Thus carries a habit to think things pessimistically.

==Notes==
* Received Kai Ni on November 20th, 2014, during the [[Fall 2014 Event]].
** The first kanmusu to receive one without a game maintenance.
** Suffered a bugged release with issues such as not being able to re-equip her [[Searchlight]] without a refresh & her name showing up as '''なし''' under an opponent's fleet in [[Exercises (PvP)|PvP]].
* Remodeling her results in a class change to an [[List of Aviation Battleships by upgraded maximum stats|Aviation Battleship]].

==Trivia==
* Named after [[wikipedia:Yamashiro_Province|Yamashiro Province]], now the southern part of [[wikipedia:Kyoto_Prefecture|Kyoto Prefecture]].
** Literally means ''mountain castle''.
* Japan's first Super-Dreadnought class & the first class to be completely indigenous as opposed to the, at the time, [[:Category:Kongou Class|Kongou class]] battlecruisers.
** Super dreadnoughts are an era within the [[wikipedia:Battleship|battleships]].
** Yamashiro was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched Gloster Sparrowhawk and Sopwith Camel fighters from it, becoming the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yamashiro_Sparrow_Hawk.jpg first Japanese ship to launch aircraft].
** As time passed, her design showed numerous faults that outweighed her merits, even after improvements derived from Fusou, & led to endless modifications.
** Due to poor maintenance, sailors considered assignment to the [[:Category:Fusou Class|Fusou class]] to be the worst sea postings possible.
* The remodeling into an [[#Notes|Aviation Battleship]] stems from a plan for the [[:Category:Fusou Class|Fusou class]] after the carrier losses during the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Midway|''Battle of Midway'']]. However, it was performed on the [[:Category:Ise Class|Ise class]] instead.
* Sunk during night battle in the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Surigao_Strait|''Battle of Surigao Strait'']], October 25th, 1944.
* Wreck location confirmed by sound scans by John Bennett in 2001, but he disappeared in 2004 before he could dive to her wreckage. Later in 2006, Cedric Verdier dived to her wreckage and saw her, but without photographic instruments. [https://deeptechasia.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/the-yamashiro-project/]
** Paul Allen's RV Petrel, who discovered Musashi's wreck, located Yamashiro upside down in Surigao Strait in November 25, 2017, providing with finality the location of her resting place, which was then speculation.
* On the first day of the Spring 2017 event, there was a bug with the drops on the E1 map causing Yamashiro Kai Ni (ID 212) to drop instead of Asagumo (ID 213).
