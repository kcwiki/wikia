|Library/En = A compact body enriched with heavy arms, the experimental light cruiser, Yuubari.<br>The data that I left behind, those various newly-developed naval heavy weapons were certainly the cause!<br>A shot in the engine room? What are you talking about?<br>Really... how rude you are.
|Library/Note = Yuubari was originally laid down as an experimental cruiser under the guidance of Constructor Cpt. Yuzuru Hiraga, the most famous Japanese naval architect of his time. She served as a prototype for the forthcoming Furutaka-class, which incorporated many of Hiraga's ideas concerning weight reduction and cramming the maximum firepower into a given displacement.

==Notes==
*Loses ability to equip [[List of Seaplanes by stats|seaplanes]] and [[List of Secondary Guns by stats|secondary guns]] upon remodelling to Kai Ni. Additionally, she has restrictions on slot 4 ('''NO '''[[List of Main Guns by stats|main guns]] or [[List of Torpedoes by stats|torpedos]]) and slot 5 ([[List of Radars by stats|'''small''' radars]], [[List of Anti-Air Guns by stats|anti-air guns]], or [[Combat Ration|combat rations]] '''ONLY''').
*Her Kai Ni form shares AACI with Kasumi Kai Ni B:
**<u>High-Angle mount</u> (any) {{GreenGunDP}}, plus <u>AA Gun</u> (any) {{GreenGunMG}}, plus [[:Category:Air_Radar|AA Radar]]{{Radar}}. API value of 16, shootdown 4. 
*Yuubari Kai Ni Toku can equip [[List of Torpedoes by stats|minisubs]] (enabling an opening torpedo strike), [[List of Landing Crafts by stats|landing crafts]], and [[List of Landing Crafts by stats|tanks]]. She cannot equip [[List of Radars by stats|'''large''' radars]]. She only needs a turbine to regain fast speed.
*Yuubari Kai Ni D can perform OASW regardless of her ​ASW stat. Similarly to Kai Ni Toku, she cannot equip [[List of Radars by stats|'''large''' radars]].

==Character==

===Appearance===
* In the anime she also serves as the fleet's mechanic (due to the absence of Akashi) and wears an alternate outfit consisting of orange coveralls over a tank top.
* Heavily associated with melons (more specifically, cantaloupes), due to her name (Yuubari city in Hokkaido is famous for its cantaloupes) and her color scheme and her general resemblance to a cantaloupe. This has led to fans giving her the nickname "Melon-chan" or just "Melon".

===Personality===
*Yuubari is proud of her experimental equipment and regularly checks them. She does not like being one of the slowest ships of the fleet, as evidenced by some of her lines where she screams "Wait for me!".
*She loves anime and even stays up late at night to watch them (most anime air late night) as shown by her 01:00 hourly line.

==Trivia==
*She has an extra equipment slot but has lower HP, Armour and Evasion than other light cruisers.
*Arguably the best ASW ship in the game based on 4 slots (fits 3 sonars and a depth charge) and how Anti-Submarine warfare calculation works.[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Combat#Damage_Calculation]
*Smallest among the light cruisers featured in the game (in terms of displacement and length; compare her 3,587 ton displacement to the mean Japanese light cruiser displacement of about 6300 tons).
*Sunk 28 April 1944 by US submarine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bluegill_%28SS-242%29 ''Bluegill'']''.''
*While her official art shows her equipped with the [[14cm Twin Gun Mount]] as her historical counterpart, the said equipment didn't appear until the [[Winter 2015 Event]].
