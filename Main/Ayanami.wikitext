==Trivia==
*Scuttled following the [[wikipedia:Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 14–15 November|Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], November 15, 1942 (not to be mistaken with the <b>Second Naval Battle of the Solomons</b> in Japanese sources, as this is the <b>[[wikipedia:Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]</b>). ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Ayanami_%281929%29&params=9_10_S_159_52_E_type:landmark_region:SB 9°10′S 159°52′E])

**It was first carried by the thirty-second and last ship of the first Kamikaze class in 1909.
*Wreck discovered in 1992 by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ballard Dr. Robert Ballard]. Her wreck around 700-800 meters. The wreck rest on 2 pieces. Initially mistaken as Akatsuki's as their wrecks are in the same vicinity.
*Her second remodel represents her performance during her final mission, a night battle where she formed a single 'prong' of a three-pronged attack alone (other prongs each contained a light cruiser and multiple destroyers), sank (or helped sink) three destroyers, heavily damaged a fourth, and assisted Kirishima in trading fire with a battleship, the ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_South_Dakota_(BB-57) USS South Dakota]''.
*Received her Kai Ni on 20/06/2014.
