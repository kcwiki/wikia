==Character==

===Appearance===
*Uzuki wears a purplish shirt which bares her midriff with a black skirt with pink frills. She wears black kneesocks with white stripes similar to those worn by the Fubuki class, and has long pink hair done up into a ponytail held in place with the distinctive moon-shaped trinket the Mutsuki-class share, a ribbon à la [[Yura]]'s (albeit much shorter), and a pink bunny-shaped hair pin. She has red eyes.
*When remodeled, she gains a trinket on her collar in remembrance of a lost comrade. This trinket is [[Kako]]'s hair pin, which references Uzuki rescuing Kako's survivors on August 11, 1942. When damaged, it is revealed she wears sarashi à la [[Haruna]]'s.

===Personality===
*Uzuki is depicted as a foil to [[Yayoi]], in that she is very cheerful and playful when compared to other members of her class. She calls herself "U-chan", and like some other ships, has a verbal tic; hers being "pyon" (ぴょん), a common Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of bunnies hopping, explaining her bunny-shaped hair pin.

==Trivia==
*She always says ''pyon pyon'' because the first kanji in her name (卯) literally means "rabbit". ''Pyon pyon ''is a common Japanese onomatopoeia for the hopping of rabbits.
*Her name is the name for the fourth month of the lunar calendar (April).
**It was first carried by the twenty-sixth ship of the first Kamikaze class in 1907.
*The kanji "卯" came from the Chinese Earthly Branches system, and was adopted by the Japanese as part of the lunar calendar system. The system is also associated with the Chinese zodiac, and thus, 卯 becomes associated with the 4th zodiac, the rabbit. That's why Uzuki is highly associated with both April and rabbit. 
*Torpedoed December 12, 1944 northeast of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu Cebu], Philippines ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Uzuki_%281925%29&params=11_03_N_124_23_E_ 11°03′N 124°23′E]).
*Uzuki temporarily dropped in several maps during April 2014
*Upon her arrival with [[Yayoi]] in KC on January 29, 2014, the devs committed a small error by setting Uzuki available via construction instead of Yayoi. The error was fixed within an hour.

==Quests==
*Required by Quests [[Quests#A34|A34]], [[Quests#B24|B24]], [[Quests#A66|A66]], [[Quests#B60|B60]], [[Quests#B72|B72]].
*Quest A34 and Quest B24 is a quest chain that leads to Headquarters Personnel, which increases the active quest limit by one.
