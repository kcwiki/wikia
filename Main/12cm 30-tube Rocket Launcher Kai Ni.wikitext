{{Equipment

|en = An improved variant of the ship-based anti-air rocket launcher, the 12cm 30-tube Rocket Launcher, further refined by lessons learned in combat. With improvements to backblast countermeasures, reloading, and even fire control, the ability of the launcher's continuous rocket barrage of incendiary anti-air shrapnel to shield friendly ships from thinly armored enemy aircraft has further improved. Ise Kai and Hyuuga Kai's high anti-air effectiveness stands out further with this.
