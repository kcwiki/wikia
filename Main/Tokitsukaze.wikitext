==Character==
===Appearance===
*Tokitsukaze has brown eyes, short black hair with long sidelocks. The sides of her hair fade into grey at the ends, while on her head is a small smokestack-style hat sitting on a black strap with two pieces of cloth with an anchor embroidered on each.
*Tokitsukaze wears a yellow scarf secured by an anchor with the chain going around her collar, a very short slightly see-through white buttoned sailor dress with blue stripes on her cuffs and end of her dress, which the excess is tied into a knot on her left hip that exposes the strings of her panties. She only wears a lowleg, side-tie [https://twitter.com/M_ars/status/505384807241494528/photo/1 white panties] that barely covers anything below, under her dress and a black pantyhose that only goes up to her above her crotch, ending with rudder high heels.
*Tokitsukaze is armed with a waist-mounted quadruple torpedo mount on her back and a 12.7cm twin gun mount with a pouch-like cover at the back, secured by a shoulder strap on her right shoulder.

==Trivia==
* Member of the 16th Destroyer Division along with [[Yukikaze]], [[Amatsukaze]] and [[Hatsukaze]].
* She was crippled during the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bismarck_Sea Battle of the Bismarck Sea] on March 3, 1943, with the loss of 19 crewmen. [[Yukikaze]] rescued her survivors and Tokitsukaze was consequently left dead in the water. She was then sunk by Allied aircraft the following morning.
* Her name means "favorable wind".
** It was first carried by the fourth and last Destroyer of the Isokaze class in 1917.
