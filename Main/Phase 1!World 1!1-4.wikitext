New players will notice that this map marks the first appearance of enemy aircraft carriers. As you will most likely be lacking carriers of your own at this point in time, you will have to rely on brute force without any carrier support.

After playing this stage once, you may notice that standard aircraft carriers kind of hurt. For now, your only countermeasures are farming for heavy cruisers at 1-3/this stage and training them, crafting battleships and using them to push through with their firepower and armor, or building your own aircraft carrier and equipping fighters of your own to shoot down enemy aircraft. If you have Isuzu, getting her to level 12 and Remodeling her gives a huge boost to Anti-Air which also helps. Note that getting an aircraft carrier will also help to complete the Akagi quests ([[Quests#A11|A11]] and [[Quests#B10|B10]]).
