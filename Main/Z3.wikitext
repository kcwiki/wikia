==Trivia==
* As with [[Z1]] & many Type 1934 destroyers, she was named after a German naval officer who died during World War I.
* Hit a naval mine & sunk on February 22, 1940 as part of Operation Wikinger. Z1 was attacked and sunk by a friendly He 111 and during the evasive manoeuvres that followed Z3 was unfortunate enough to sail into a freshly laid British minefield.
* Buildable in normal construction with Z1 set as flagship.
* The 'Z' in her name stands for ''Zerstörer'', which is German for ''destroyer''.
* She received her second upgrade on [http://pastebin.com/PVTHWkbd 28/03/2014], together with Z1 & [[Kirishima]].
** 改 means "remodelled" (for the first time), 改二 means "remodelled a second time", etcetera. However, German ships use ''Zwei'' (two) & ''Drei'' (three) for 改二 & 改三, respectively, omitting the 改.
