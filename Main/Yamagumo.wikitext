==Character==
===Appearance===
*Yamagumo wears a short-sleeved white shirt, arm warmers, bike shorts under a skirt with suspenders and black kneehighs. Her equipment consists of a twin-gun turret, quad torpedo launcher and a randoseru-shaped structure which holds her rigging. She has gray hair which is held in place by a hairband and is worn up into what appears to be a ponytail with a green hair tie at the end.
*After remodeling, she gains a radar-shaped hairpin, and her hair tie is moved higher up her hair.

==Trivia==
* Her name means "mountain cloud".
* Sunk as part of the Nishimura Fleet at Surigao Strait during the Battle of Leyte Gulf,  25 October 1944. She was hit by torpedoes from the  USS ''McDermut. ''
**Discovered late 2017 by RV Petrel, along with the rest of the Nishimura fleet, except for Mogami who sank farther. She would be eventually discovered about a year later.
