{{:Kongou/Special Cut-In}}

==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
* Kongou is hyperactive, very cheerful, loves to mix her Japanese sentences with random English words and is overly fond of her admiral.
* She loves black tea, on account of her construction in England.
* Ends many of her statements with "ネー" (ne) and "デース" (です/desu in English accent), usually in an exaggerated, whimsical manner.

==Appearances in derivative works==
[[File:Kongou-anime.png|thumb|right]]
*Kongou appears in the anime adaptation of Kantai Collection, and was also featured in the adaptation's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABZN292gvRo first trailer]. She played a big role in it, as she appeared to be the only member of the Fifth Mobile Fleet Fubuki could get along with.
She is also the only Kongou-class to be in Kai-Ni form in the anime.
*Kongou appeared as one of the main characters in ''[[Print media#side:Kongou|side:Kongou]]''.
*Kongou—along with other ships voiced by Nao Touyama—were featured in the first KanColle Drama CD, titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H71UmCq3lWc "Hiei's Curry"] (比叡、カレーを作る). Due to only having one seiyuu voicing all the characters, the CD's short story is also referred to as the "One Nao Show". <!-- An earlier revision also had this: https://soundcloud.com/masapusan/one-nao-show -->

==Original ship==
*She was the only ship of her class that was built by the [[wikipedia:Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering|Vickers Shipbuilding Company]] in the U.K. 
*She shares a similar design to the ''[[wikipedia:Lion-class battlecruiser|Lion]]''-class battlecruisers  of the Royal Navy (her cousin ships). 
*The IJN refitted her from a [[wikipedia:Battlecruiser|battlecruiser]] into a full-fledged battleship in 1929, bolstering her fighting ability while maintaining the speed necessary to escort carriers.
*She was the only Japanese battleship sunk by submarines in the Second World War, and the last battleship sunk by submarines in history.
*Sunk by USS ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Sealion_(SS-315) Sealion]'' in Formosa Strait, 21 November 1944. After the torpedo hits, she tried to go back to Keelung in Formosa, but she was flooded uncontrollably and after listing 45 degrees, the front magazine exploded, sinking her.

==Trivia==
*She's named after [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kong%C5%8D Mount Kongou], located between Nara and Osaka prefectures, and literally means "Indestructible" or "Diamond".
<!--*The radar wings that she and her sisters wear share a similar coloration and design to the alternate name for "金剛" which means "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajra vajra]", but more accurately "ghanta" (bells). [http://drilbudorje.tripod.com/_Dorje.htm See this page] (scroll to 12th Century) to compare the CGs.-->
* She and her sister-ships start at 3 slots, a reference to their start as "Battlecruisers".
* Received her Kai Ni on November 1, 2013.
* Her name is currently listed in the JMSDF as JDS ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDS_Kong%C5%8D Kongou]'', as is [[Kirishima]]'s.
* Launched on 18 May 1912 and commissioned on 16 August 1913, she used to be the oldest ship in Kantai Collection until [[Gangut]] (launched on 20 October 1911 and commissioned on 11 January 1915) broke this record.
