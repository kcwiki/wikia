An advanced version of a type 0 fighter plane for use as dive bomber, also known as "bomber-fighter". It is a Model 53 plane with an improved engine and a fuel tank that was made bullet-proof. 250/500kg bomb racks were attached under the fuselage, and several parts of the aircraft were strenghtened to be able to withstand dive bombing manoeuvres. Feel free to use them on, for example, light attack carriers that were remodelled from heavy cruisers.
