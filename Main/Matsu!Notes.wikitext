*Her name means Pine.
*The lead ship of the IJN's (belated) attempt to create a cheap standardised construction class of multi-purpose destroyers for escort duties.
*Laid down in August of '43 and completed by February she was completed on 28th April.
*She only sortied once, to escort Convoy 4804. The convoy itself was a success but on its return it was unfortunate enough to be spotted by aircraft from TF 58 which proceeded to decimate much of the convoy. The one remaining merchant ship and escorts (including ''[[Kaiboukan No.4|CD-4]]'') attempted to flee into the night while Matsu engaged in a delaying action. While she was succesful in achieving this with her weak armamant she had no chance of victory, and after a brief chase was sunk by the destroyers USS ''Cogswell'', ''Ingersoll'' and ''Knapp''.
