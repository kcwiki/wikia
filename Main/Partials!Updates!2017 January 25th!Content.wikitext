==={{new}} PvP System===
A new PvP system has been implemented, which allows players to narrow down the PvP opponents they want to receive. The PvP opponents are now split into 2 pools and the players have 3 choices:
* (New) PvP Fleet (1st Group) - The opponents are much stronger than the 2nd Group.
* (New) PvP Fleet (Group 2) - The opponents selected are those around your level.
* (Old Ver.) WHOLE - The opponents is chosen using the old method.
''Note: Players can only change the PvP method 2 hours before a PvP reset.''

===Libeccio in 4-5===
{{ShipLink|Libeccio}} is now permanently available as a drop in [[4-5]].
She is known to drop on nodes I, J and H in [[4-5]].
<br />
<br />

===Zara now available in LSC===
{{ShipLink|Zara}} can now be constructed in LSC. While {{ShipLink|Zara}} herself is not as impressive in terms of combat stats, she carries the ability to use {{Seaplane}}Bombers and Fighters. She is also required for improving a {{EquipmentLink|Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane|text=Ro.43}} to a {{EquipmentLink|Ro.44 Seaplane Fighter|text=Ro.44}}.
To construct her in LSC, you need to have at least one of the 2 following ships as secretary:
* {{ShipLink|Libeccio}}
* {{ShipLink|Pola}}
The amount of resources is still under investigation, but the devs suggested that it shouldn't be too little or too much.
