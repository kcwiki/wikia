==Strategy== <!-- Detailed events -->

With the secure of the southwestern resources, the Teitoku abruptly orders a fleet reorganization. The [[#Naval_Base_Fleets|''Third Torpedo Squadron'']] is in shock, yet begins to pack up their belongings. Before sleeping, [[Fubuki]] & [[Mutsuki]] stroll outside to contemplate the recent happenings, but [[Yuudachi]] was right behind, followed by [[Sendai]], [[Jintsuu]], & [[Naka]]. They end on a cheer by Naka, since Jintsuu's was too serious.

The next day, the whole base is gradually given their reassignments one-by-one in the Teitoku's office. The atmosphere in the hallway is filled with nervousness. Fubuki has been reassigned to the [[#Naval_Base_Fleets|''Fifth Mobile Unit'']] while Mutsuki is in the [[#Naval_Base_Fleets|''Fourth Fleet'']]. They head off to their new dormitories & at one of the ''Fifth Mobile Unit'''s rooms, Fubuki encounters [[Kitakami]] & [[Ooi]]. Before greetings can be exchanged, Ooi interrupts to usher Fubuki out. Ooi desires a room for Kitakami & herself & as such, directs Fubuki to the unit's other room. Unfortunately, within, [[Kaga]] & [[Zuikaku]] are not compatible. Fubuki awkwardly exits & runs into [[Kongou]], the last member of their unit. Now that they've gathered, they first attempt to arrange rooms.... It's been slotted for the future. 

After classes that day, Fubuki consults Mutsuki & Yuudachi, but they've meshed quite well in their new fleets. At Mamiya's Cafe, Fubuki runs into [[Akagi]] & she cannot resist consulting with her once more. In the process, Akagi explains [[#Notes|Operation FS]]. With renewed cheer, Fubuki rushes back to the ''Fifth Mobile Unit'''s rooms.

However, it's dashed during the unit's current task - deciding upon the flagship. It's become chaos. To resolve the situation, a round of rotating flagships with the overall MVP being the permanent flagship is settled upon. Kongou starts....& fails spectacularly. Zuikaku's next....& fails spectacularly. It does not improve during Kaga's, Kongou's (second), or Ooi's [[#Notes|turns]].

As such, with nearly everyone's agreement, Zuikaku decides to request the ''Fifth Mobile Unit'' be disbanded & reassigned. However, Fubuki wish-washily disagrees until she's reminded of Akagi. Before she's able to persuade Zuikaku, a convenient emergency arises that somehow only has the ''Fifth Mobile Unit'' as responders. Even having lost multiple bases, the [[Enemy_Vessel|Abyssal Fleet]] is able to assault the mainland itself.

The sortie begins poorly, with Zuikaku & Ooi doing their own thing. Here, Fubuki interjects & goes back to the basics. The engagement initiates with Fubuki as point & taking fire. A [[Type 21 Zero Fighter]] then distracts while a [[Type 97 Torpedo Bomber]] & Kongou attack. Kitakami & Ooi wrap things up while the others are delt with offscreen.

After returning, Fubuki has been selected as flagship & the rooms have been arranged. However, Kongou is missing her [https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1665700 tea time], & Kaga would appreciate her [https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1665700 personal space].

Regarding [[Anime/Notes_%26_Trivia#Notes|Operation FS]]'s current status:
* There are two Abyssal bases in the southwest, relative to the naval base
* The plan is to split their sea lanes so they can be neutralized in an order
* The hope is to discover the [[Enemy_vessel|Abyssal fleet]]'s origins & goals
* A step the Naval Base is taking is to increase the fleets' flexibility
** Of which the reorganization is one part


Regarding the flagship rotation:
* Kongou may be relying upon instinctual communication with [[:Category:Kongou_Class|her sisters]]
* Zuikaku was not able to outrange the Abyssals, or have Kaga follow her orders
* Kaga is ineffective
* Ooi relies on instinctual communication with Kitakami while everyone else only protects Kitakami


Destroyers being flagships has happened multiple times
* 
* Not including the game of course
