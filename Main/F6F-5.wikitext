* The second major production model of the F6F Hellcat, the F6F-5 was first produced from Grumman's Bethpage plant in April 1944, and would arrive on the decks of US carriers not long afterward. Notable improvements over the previous production model include a more aerodynamic engine cowling, the deletion of the rear windows in the cockpit, a more powerful engine with water injection allowing for temporary speed boosts, and an increased speed of up to 391mph. 
* Unlike the F6F-3 which was painted in a three-color scheme, most F6F-5s were painted in the single dark navy blue as shown here, which helped to distinguish them from the previous model.
