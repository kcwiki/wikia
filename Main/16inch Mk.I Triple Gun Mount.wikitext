|en = The Nelson-class was a class of super-dreadnoughts that were built with 16 inch guns in the land of black tea as part of the Big Seven under the naval treaty. These large-caliber triple battleship guns were used as their main armament and carried entirely in the front. While it wasn't without its problems, the Nelson-class, with its ambitious design of three of these main batteries, for a total of nine barrels, all concentrated north of the bridge, were part of the Big Seven alongside Japan's Nagato and Mutsu.
