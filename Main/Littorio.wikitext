==Notes==
*[[Spring 2015 Event]], E-4 clear reward.
*[[Seasonal/Christmas 2015]], World 4-5 Nodes I, J, H temporary drop. Node I has highest drop rate at 2.866%.[http://db.kcwiki.moe/event-christmas2015/]
*The 24 February 2016 Ranking update allows the Italian battleships and heavy cruisers to launch Seaplane Bombers (such as [[Zuiun]] and [[Prototype Seiran]]) while retaining their current classification after remodeling.

==Trivia==
*The real Littorio was badly damaged during the British air raid on Taranto on November 11 1940, which put her out of action until the following March. She participated in a few naval battles, such as the First and Second Battle of Sirte, but she stayed in port during the latter part of the war because of Italy's lack of fuel. She was renamed Italia on 30 July 1943 after the collapse of the Benito Mussolini's Fascist government. She was struck from the naval register on 1 June 1948 and later scrapped in 1952-54 at La Spezia.

*The name "Littorio" comes from the Roman lictor. Lictors were civil servants tasked with defending the magistrates of the Roman Empire. The term became associated with the National Fascist Party, who derived their name and emblems from the "fasces lictoriae", the symbol of authority carried by lictors. Therefore, her name was changed to Italia when Italy left the axis powers to disassociate her from fascism.

*The red and white stripes come from the distinctive markings fitted on the bow of all Italian ships after the Battle of Punta Stilo (1940), during which Italian bombers couldn't distinguish between the Italian and the British ships; the grey and green pattern on her corset is a reference to the first "fishbone"-style camouflage scheme adopted by the Italian ships during the war.
