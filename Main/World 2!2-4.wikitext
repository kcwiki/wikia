===Note===
*Clearing this map will unlock [[World_3/3-1|3-1]], [[World_4/4-1|4-1]], and [[World_7/7-1|7-1]] but not the subsequent maps of each world. To unlock those, clearing [[World_1/1-5|1-5]] (at least once) and [[World_7/7-1|7-1]] are required.
===Recommended Fleets===

*North or South Route with Heavy Fleet
*{{Event/Route|B|red|C|magenta|F|red|J|blue|M|red|P|red}} or {{Event/Route|B|red|C|magenta|G|green|H|blue|I|red|K|blue|L|red|P|red}}
**Longer route with '''4 Battles total''' (Both North and South routes.)
**2 ((F)BB(V)+CV(B)) + 2DD + 0-1 CVL + XX (CA(V)/CLT)
***1(F)BB(V) + 1CV(B) + 1CVL + 2DD + 1XX
***2CV(B) + 1CVL + 2~3 DD + 1~0 XX (Taking 2 DD will guarantee going to {{Event/Route|C|magenta}})
**{{Event/Route|C|magenta}} and {{Event/Route|G|green}} are both random with the comp, so going north or south is entirely by chance.
**Recommended for '''Players who lack properly leveled Destroyers'''.
**Please Note that when using a Heavy Fleet there is always the chance to off-route to either {{Event/Route|A|green}} or {{Event/Route|E|red}}.


*Middle Route with Light Fleet {{Event/Route|B|red|G|green|H|blue|L|red|P|red}}
**This is the shortest Route '''(3 Battles Total)'''
***1 CL 4 DD 1 CA(V)
**'''Not Recommended for Beginners for clearing the Map''', due to this method needing high leveled and fully modernized Destroyers to survive the Pre-Boss Nodes and handle the Heavy Enemy Fleet in the Boss Node.
