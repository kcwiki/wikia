{{clear}}
==== Updates on [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]]====
*[[Prototype 35.6cm Triple Gun Mount]], [[35.6cm Twin Gun Mount (Dazzle Camouflage)]], [[Prototype 41cm Triple Gun Mount]], [[Type 0 Observation Seaplane]], [[Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane]] can be improved
*[[Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane]] can be upgraded into [[Ro.44 Seaplane Fighter]]

====Ship updates ====
*{{ShipLink|Verniy}} can now equip [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]] and [[Anti-torpedo Bulge (Medium)]].

====New Equipment Category: "Seaplane Fighter"====
*Can be used by those who can equip Seaplane Bombers, as well as some other remodeled BB including: {{ShipLink|Nagato}} [[Nagato#Upgrade|Kai]], {{ShipLink|Mutsu}} [[Mutsu#Upgrade|Kai]], {{ShipLink|Yamato}} [[Yamato#Upgrade|Kai]], {{ShipLink|Musashi}} [[Musashi#Upgrade|Kai]]
**They basically only participate in air battle i.e. "Stage 1" in [[Aerial Combat]], which means they are immune from Anti-Air.
**Does not enable Artillery Spotting
*The only Seaplane Fighter now is [[Ro.44 Seaplane Fighter]], but devs said more will be introduced into the game in the future.

====Development====
*[[Ro.43 Reconnaissance Seaplane]] can be developed under specific circumstances
**Possibly requiring the use of Italian ships?

====[[Hishimochi]]====
*One free [[Hishimochi#Exchange|Hishimochi]] for all Admirals entering the server until next maintenance
**No [[Seasonal/Hishimochi_2015|mini-event]] this time
*One more free [[Hishimochi#Exchange|Hishimochi]] for those whom has completed [[Quests#B60|B60 Quest]], alternatively see below.
**If you have received a [[Hishimochi#Exchange|Hishimochi]] before the next maintenance, whenever that is you will get up to two (extra) [[Hishimochi#Exchange|Hishimochi]] '''after''' you have completed B60 Quest.
**If you have not received a free [[Hishimochi#Exchange|Hishimochi]] - this is probably because the next maintenance was due and you did not make it in time. However you will still be eligible to receive a free [[Hishimochi#Exchange|Hishimochi]] for completing B60 making it one (extra) [[Hishimochi#Exchange|Hishimochi]].
