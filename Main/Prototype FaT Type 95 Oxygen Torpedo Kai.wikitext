This is a prototype, submarine oxygen torpedo with the FaT guidance system which uses a gyroscopic mechanism to change course overtime that was developed from another (Germany) country for use on surface attacks on enemy warships. This prototype oxygen torpedo was brought by U-boats for practical use on sea-lane control.

*FaT stands for ''Federapparat-Torpedo'' or ''Flächen-Absuch-Torpedo'' (''spring device torpedo'' or ''area searching torpedo''), [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Federapparat_1.JPG#/media/File:Federapparat_1.JPG a mechanical device] that changes the torpedo's course over time so that it runs back and forth on parallel lines of 800 or 1600 m in length.
*These testing prototype torpedoes only exist on paper, combining the deadly damage and long range of the Type 95 "Long Lance" submarine-based torpedoes and the FaT guiding system that increased the accuracy of the warhead by adjusting the course little by little on the way to the target to ensure maximum desired impact.
*The fairy can be seen holding [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flachenabsuchender_Torpedo_type_I-firing_positions.svg#/media/File:Flachenabsuchender_Torpedo_type_I-firing_positions.svg an example] of how the FaT guidance system actually works.
*This is the first torpedo equipment in-game not to have a torpedo launcher or a submarine bow as part of its design.
