== Character ==
* '''[[Glossary#List of Vessels by Japanese Voice Actresses|Seiyuu]]''': [http://myanimelist.net/people/13/Ayako_Kawasumi Kawasumi Ayako] (川澄綾子)

==Trivia==
* [[Summer 2014 Event]] E-3 preboss node flagship & E-4 Boss.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll Midway Island].
* She's immune to torpedoes, so neither torpedo bombers nor torpedo attacks will land on her. During night battle the ships will only attack her using their firepower stat.
* She's an installation type, so she's weak against [[Type 3 Shell]].
*Damage text is different from others:
**Slightly damaged (小破) →　Confused (混乱)
**Moderately damaged (中破) →　Damaged (損害)
**Heavily damaged (大破) → Broken (損壊)
**Sunken (撃沈) →　Destroyed (破壊)
* The three runways around her are based on the three runways on Midway Island ([[wikipedia:Battle_of_Midway#Yamamoto.27s_plan:_Operation_MI|seen here]]).
* Her 2nd form is based on the Midway-based aircraft attacks following the battle, which sunk [[Mikuma]] after her collision with [[Mogami]].
** Her planes are references to US Navy aircraft: the [[Abyssal Hell Dive Bomber]] refers to the Navy's "helldiving" nickname for dive bombing, later applied to the [[wikipedia:Curtiss_SB2C_Helldiver|SB2C Helldiver]], the [[Abyssal Cat Fighter]] is the [[wikipedia:Grumman_F4F_Wildcat|F4F Wildcat]] and subsequent "-cat" fighters, and the [[Abyssal Revenge Torpedo Bomber]] is the [[wikipedia:Grumman_TBF_Avenger|TBF Avenger]].
** Her equipment change to a radar rather than bombers in her final form may refer to the breaking of the Japanese codes by the Americans.
**Lack of torpedo bombers in her final form may be a reference to a TBD Devastator squadron that were completely wiped out by Kido Butai's Combat Air Patrol.

* In the [[Anime]], voiced by [http://myanimelist.net/people/362/Yoshiko_Sakakibara Sakakibara Yoshiko] (榊原良子).
**She has evolved from [[Airfield Princess]].
**She also serves as the final enemy encounter for the first season.
