==Guides and Tips==
*This map '''DOES NOT''' have a tag; therefore, any previously used ships can be used here.
*This is a combined fleet map.
*There are two hidden gimmicks (see below).  Activating both is strongly recommended in order to make the map defeatable.
**Changing difficulties will reset the map gimmicks.
*There are 3 LBAS available for you to use.
*A minimum range of '''9''' is required to reach the boss node U. (See map below)
** Because of the high range requirements, it is recommended to use {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Large Flying Boat}} or {{EquipmentLink|PBY-5A Catalina}} in order to increase the maximum range of your land bases and reach the boss node.
** Alternatively, bases comprising of entirely 9+ range attack aircraft may be used.
*Unlike previous maps, this map has enemy air raids against player land bases that can damage your LBAS aircraft and resources, however on easy mode the air raids won't appear.
**You can consider setting up one of the land bases in air defense mode and fill it with [[List of Interceptor Fighters by stats|Interceptors]] and [[List of Fighters by stats|Fighters]] to reduce the amount of damage dealt to your bases and resources.
***This is not advisable on any difficulty, due to loss of firepower.
*This map is infested with boss-level ships at multiple nodes including 3 that guard the boss route and '''there is no way around them'''
**{{ShipLink|Destroyer Princess}} leads a torpedo squadron at the G node.
***While not dangerous in shelling, the enemies here can deal heavy damage to the escort fleet if they are able to launch torpedoes in the closing torpedo phase.
****Destroyer Princess in particular is fairly sturdy (100 or 115 armor) and can be difficult to bring down to ''chuuha'' before torpedoes.
***A strong opening phase (aircraft bombing, opening torpedo, support shelling) is key to avoiding damage here.
***Bringing 1-2 FBB for Carrier Task Force escort fleets is a good option here.
**{{ShipLink|New Submarine Princess/Flagship|text=New Submarine Princess}} awaits at node J, node K and node H.
***Having at least 2 OASW ships in the escort fleet is advised to mitigate damage from these nodes.
***Focusing more on firepower at the boss encounter and relying on evasion (''i.e.'' sparkling) or armor (''i.e.'' battleships in escort) are also options.
***For S-ranking submarine nodes for the gimmick (see below), 5+ OASW ships is recommended.
**{{ShipLink|Aircraft Carrier Summer Princess}} awaits in an abyssal combined fleet at node Q.
***Bringing {{ShipLink|Akizuki|Teruzuki|Hatsuzuki|link_class=Akizuki|text=Akizuki-Class DDs}} for AACI is recommended. Due to routing constraints Maya Kai Ni is not advised.
**One to three {{ShipLink|Battleship Summer Princess}} await at preboss node T.
***Her escort contains many {{ShipLink|PT Imp Pack|PT Imp Pack III|PT Imp Pack IV|text=PT Imps}}. Sending one base full of land-based bombers here (range 8+) can help mitigate damage here, as many admirals will not have enough high range planes to sortie all three bases to the boss node.
***Because the enemies here have no air power, equipping many torpedo bomber aircraft to main fleet carriers is desirable to deal high opening damage.
**A [[Fleet Command Facility]] is vital here for increasing success rate of reaching the boss during the gauge chipping phase before the final kill.
*The boss node itself contains the sturdy and powerful {{ShipLink|European Princess|European Princess/Damaged|text=European Princess}}.
**On Easy and Medium, one tanky {{ShipLink|Battleship Summer Princess}} enters the boss fleet for the final kill phase.
**On Hard, two {{ShipLink|Battleship Summer Princess}} are present before the final kill phase, and an {{ShipLink|Aircraft Carrier Summer Princess}} joins for the final kill, making for one of the sturdiest enemy fleets seen so far.
**Land base aerial support is highly desirable here to shave down the enemy fleet (especially Tsu-class), but sending more to the boss instead of preboss means a less stable means of getting to the boss.
**Due to the 1.3x post-cap modifer given by the map gimmick (see below), it's very possible to output high damage in the day battle phase.
***As >> rank bombers give carriers increased critical chance and critical damage on top of shelling firepower, bringing at least two bombers on each carrier is highly recommended.
***Considering head-on engagement, opening airstrikes, and stabilizing the pass rate long the route, 3-4 bombers on each carrier is a very viable option.
****To maintain air control at Q and the boss, equipping seaplane fighters (''e.g.'' to {{ShipLink|Yura Kai Ni}} in the main fleet) or bringing a light carrier in the second fleet are viable measures.
**For night battle, torpedo cruisers are a reliable source of damage, and torpedo cut-in setups on DDs and CLs can also help.
***For Hard, the boss armor is ''very'' high (269, 289 for damaged form) so bringing ships that can approach the night battle firepower cap is desirable.
****For ships that can't output high damage at night, going for scratch damage against the high HP of the boss is also a valid option.
***On Easy/Medium, double attack setup torpedo cruisers can output good damage against the boss, so it's not highly important to bring torpedo cut-in setups.
*Both support fleets are highly recommended for clearing the gauge.

==Map Gimmicks==
There are currently '''TWO''' gimmicks on this map.
===Unlocking the First Gimmick - Shortcut===
Obtain A+ rank once on nodes P and R.  For medium and hard, <span style="font-weight:normal;">S rank each of the following nodes once: H, J, K.</span>
*'''Node H, J, and K (medium and hard only)''':
**These nodes feature {{ShipLink|New Submarine Princess/Flagship|text=New Submarine Princess}}, requiring a large amount of ASW equipment in order to obtain an S rank victory. Because this is a combined fleet map, even if submarines are not defeated in day, they may still be damaged normally and sunk in night battle.
*'''Node P''':
**This node contains installations, {{ShipLink|PT Imp Pack|text=PT Imps}} and a pattern that can feature submarines. Only an A rank is required here (8 out of 12 enemy ships sunk) so defeating the installations is not necessary.
**It is recommended to equip ship girls with machine guns, <span style="font-weight:normal;">[[Skilled Lookouts]],</span> small-caliber guns and/or secondary guns to help deal with PT imps.
**Support shelling and LBAS support have relatively high accuracy versus PT imps.
*'''Node R''':
**This node contains mostly transports and destroyers (flagship may vary). It's relatively simple to obtain an A rank or higher here, so it may be worthwhile to use some of the land bases to reduce the difficulty of E node.
After successfully completing the conditions listed above, two shortcuts (H → O and L → O) will appear.

===Unlocking the Second Gimmick - Increased firepower at nodes Q, T & U===
The second gimmick can be unlocked '''only''' after unlocking the first gimmick.
In order to trigger the second gimmick, obtain A+ rank victories on both nodes P and R '''one more time'''.
*'''Node P''':
**Node P can be reached with a Transport Combined Fleet. Other fleets are possible, but due to the appearance of the H → O and L → O routes, additional branching conditions make Transport Combined Fleets more convenient for unlocking the second gimmick.
**Route support expeditions, seaplane fighters, {{ShipLink|Taiyou/Kai Ni}}, AACI, {{ShipLink|Abukuma/Kai Ni}} and OASW can help stabilize reaching P node while using a transport fleet.
*'''Node R''':
**The same approach as when unlocking the hidden routes may be used.
**Alternatively, the shortcut may be utilized with a Carrier Task Force to take advantage of the new route
***However, it is important for you to '''check the branching rule''' before utilizing this route. Using the recommended composition will result in a long route ({{Event/Route|C|blue|G|red|D|red|F|red|H|red|L|red|O|blue|R|red}}) to node R.
After successfully unlocking the second gimmick, the "Quest Completion Sound Effect" ({{Audio|file=Sound_se_30.ogg}}) will play when returning from sortie.

===Second Gimmick Effects===
*A post-cap modifier of 1.3x is applied to all allied attacks at Q node.[https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/897664327209160704][https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/897665936249020416][https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g669a58de-5DU_CQOHj2R0bbkBk7B2cUUwQsV4ME6MQ/edit#gid=818120013]
*A post-cap modifier of 1.3x is applied to all allied attacks at T node.[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g669a58de-5DU_CQOHj2R0bbkBk7B2cUUwQsV4ME6MQ/edit#gid=818120013]
*A post-cap modifier of at least 1.3x is applied to all allied attacks at the Boss node U.[https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/897657867783872512][https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g669a58de-5DU_CQOHj2R0bbkBk7B2cUUwQsV4ME6MQ/edit#gid=818120013]
**<s>Certain other conditions (AO in fleet?) may increase this bonus further[https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/896889255254835202].</s> After the data was rechecked, there appears to only be a 1.3x post-cap modifier. [https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/899233343488761856] Only use AO if underway replenishment is needed.
**Due to the relatively low air power of the boss node, air parity and lower are not covered in the current analyses, but anecdotal evidence ([https://twitter.com/Odoke_mono/status/901823628588679170]) suggests the modifier applies even in air parity and lower.

==Drop Farming==
*Node P drops Prinz Eugen, Warspite, U-511, and several other rare ships even on Easy difficulty, but S rank is required.
**It's best to farm on Easy mode and '''before doing the route unlock gimmick''' so the strongest STF fleet can be used to reach P.
**After clearing the map, Transport Escort Fleets must be used to reach P.
*The boss drops Graf Zeppelin, Warspite, U-511 and several other rare ships.
**Aiming for either A or S rank is feasible, but resource consumption will be high.
*It seems that ''at least'' Graf Zeppelin and Warspite are limited to one per naval base. (There aren't many reports of duplicate Prinz Eugen.)
