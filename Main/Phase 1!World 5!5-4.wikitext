===Tips===
*Like [[5-3]], you must sink the flagship [[Transport Ship Wa-Class]] at the boss node '''5 times''' to clear the map.
*Nodes G and I are night battles.
*Node I is a submarine node.
*Node H contains [[Armored Carrier Demon]] ("Oni"), while node K contains [[Armored Carrier Princess]].
*A convenient way to clear this map is to use a '''fast''' fleet with a ship that can carry 4 [[Drum Canister (Transport Use)|drums]] ([[CAV]], [[Ooyodo]], [[Yuubari]]) and a combination of 2-5 [[CVB]]/[[CV]]/[[CVL]] and 3-0 [[FBB]]/[[CA]]/[[CLT]]. With this formation, you only need to fight nodes A and H before reaching the boss.
**It is advised to have AS+ at the dual carrier Oni node variant (350+ air power required) to reduce bauxite cost (preferably, all [[List of Fighters by stats|fighters]] and [[List of Torpedo Bombers by stats|bombers]] should have [[Aircraft Proficiency|maximal proficiency]]). Bomber and fighter slot sizes also positively correlate with average bauxite cost (due to proportional damage from enemy AA), while negatively correlate with retreat rate and repair cost. A composition with 2-3 bombers on 2-3 carriers can use 50 bauxite on average (5-6 fighters required for AS+, [[SCAMP]]/[[OTO]] and [[Saiun]] can be used on large (> 20) slots), while a full-bomber composition with 5 carriers can use up to 250 ([[Saiun]], 3 fighters, and up to 16 bombers).
**The highest power variation is a fleet with 5 [[CVB]]/[[CV]] and 1 [[:Category:Tone_Class|Tone-class]] [[CAV]] equipped with 4 [[Drum Canister (Transport Use)|Drum Canisters]]. This composition will consistently kills 4-5 ships out of 6 in the initial strike and occasionally kill the entire enemy fleet in the initial strike on all nodes. Compared to adding [[FBB]] or [[CLT]] into the mix, this variation costs more bauxite but has low repair cost and close to zero risk of retreat.
**1 [[CAV]] with drums, 2 [[CA]] (3 guns, one seaplane each), and 3 carriers with 3-6 bombers can be a good middle ground composition.
**For more information on surface fleet compositions that can be used for ranking, farming drops or leveling ships, see [http://5-4.blog.jp/archives/cat_1150058.html here] (in Japanese).
<!-- Commenting this out, as somewhat lower fuel cost isn't worth higher bauxite consumption and/or bucket/retreat rate
**Since node M can give up to 160/175/180 fuel with 7/8/9 drums, an "overdrumming" composition also exists, it consists of 2-3 ships with 7-9 [[Drum Canister (Transport Use)|Drum Canisters]] equipped: maximum 8 drums on 2 [[:Category:Mogami_Class|Mogami]] or [[:Category:Tone_Class|Tone-class]] [[CAV]] (or [[Ooyodo]] and one [[CAV]]) and 1 drum on 1 [[:Category:Akizuki_Class|Akizuki-class]] [[DD]] with a [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|HA mount]] and an [[Type 13 Air Radar Kai|Air Radar]] for Anti-Air Cut-In (preferably in the flagship position). 3 Carriers are also required for Air Supremacy (350+ Air Power) and preemptive Air Strikes, a basic template would include a combination of [[:Category:Unryuu_Class|Unryuu-class]] [[CV]], fast [[CVL]] or [[Hiryuu]]/[[Souryuu]] (in base form), 6 of your best [[Aircraft Proficiency|>>]] [[List of Torpedo Bombers by stats|bombers]] and [[Aircraft Proficiency|>>]] [[List of Fighters by stats|fighters]] ([[Reppuu]] or any close variant). This should result in ~170-210 ammo, ~120 bauxite, under 100 steel, ~40-70 fuel, and ~1 bucket per run, with 5-20% retreat rate. A variant with 3 bombers, 5 fighters, [[Saiun]], and 3 [[SCAMP]]/[[OTO]] should result in lower bauxite consumption (50-70), but higher bucket and retreat rate.
-->
*For farming drops, [[Experience_and_Rank#Admiral_Experience_and_Ranking|Admiral experience]], or just for clearing the map to unlock [[5-5]] and [[World 6]], a Submarine Fleet consisting of 5-6 [[SS]] also can be used; however, there is a high (> 50%) chance that your SS won't sink the flagship at the boss node, but sortie and repair cost is minimal (~40-60 fuel, ~90-120 ammo, ~10-20 steel and ~1-2 buckets per run, with ~10-20% retreat rate).
**Using high level SS with maxed armor and torpedo stats is advised, since there are several flagship DD and CL equipped with sonars and depth charges.
**If your SS levels are high enough, with decent torpedoes, this composition can also be used to farm rare drops and Admiral experience for ranking. A-rank drops include BB, CV, CVL (to feed your fleet), as well as [[Uzuki]], [[Kinugasa]], [[Kumano]], [[Suzuya]], [[Makigumo]], [[Akigumo]].
**The drawbacks are: high chance to get a D rank at node I, requires rotation (or several fleet presets) to maintain [[morale]].
**Some players choose not to clear the map specially for this composition: at the Final Form the boss node does not contain ships that can hit submarines, which results in an automatic B-rank victory (the formation doesn't matter, but Echelon or Line Abreast can be used to reduce Torpedo Attack Power by 40%; page refresh also can be used to prevent accidental clearing).
