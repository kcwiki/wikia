|en = An improved version of a triple main battery for purely domestic battleships that was developed at the artillery department of the Kure Naval Arsenal. It may be a fictitious armament, but it's supposed to be modified version of said gun with reduced weight as well as a fully developed fire control system, turning it into a battleship main armament that has been optimised as equipment for aviation battleships, especially the Ise-class aviation battleships. The Ise-class K2 in particular, after undergoing its large-scale refit, will show its full potential.
