* The Repair Team will '''ONLY''' repair the ship it is equipped on. It will '''NOT '''repair other ships which do not have their own repair team equipped, even if they are in the same fleet.

[[File:Repair Team and-or Goddes on flagship.png|thumb|200x200px|You can select which Repair Team or Goddess to be consumed to advance.]]
* If this is equipped on the flagship that gets heavily damaged then the player will be given a selection after the battle asking them if they wish to use a repair personnel to bring the flagship back to 50% HP to allow them to continue the sortie or if they wish to to retreat. If it is used this way and the next node ends the sortie without a battle (ie: last node of 1-6 or a dead end resource node) then the repair personnel will not be consumed.
* This item is consumed upon activation and the effect lasts until the end of that node's battle. If you still get heavily damaged afterward and then keep on sortie, your ship will not come back after an enemy ship sinks her, unless you have equipped another Damage Control item on her.
