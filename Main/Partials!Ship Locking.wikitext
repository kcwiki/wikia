===Ship Locking===
Introduced in the [[Summer 2014 Event]], this mechanic locks ships that were sortied out to specific event maps, making them unable to participate in other ship-locked maps.

A ship girl will receive her ship lock '''as soon as she sorties''' to an event map with shiplocks. Afterwards, '''it's impossible to remove the lock until the end of the event.''' Remodeling or marrying a ship will NOT remove the shiplock, so be careful with who you sortie to event maps. However, locks are applied on a ship ID basis, meaning that duplicates of the same ship will not have the lock applied to them.

It is important to note that while shiplocks are applied regardless of the difficulty one chooses, they are generally only enforced on '''Medium and Hard difficulty'''. Outside of some event-specific branching rules, players on Casual and Easy difficulty are free to sortie ships with shiplock tags to ''any'' event map, regardless of the lock a map requires. However, as said before, ships will always be given a shiplock tag upon sortieing to an event map, and said tag cannot be overriden or removed via any means, so sortieing to event maps on lower difficulties will still lock ships out of event maps on higher difficulties. Always be careful about who is sortied to an event map.

Here's a shiplocking example using the Winter 2019 Event:
* Sortieing {{ShipLink|Murasame/Kai Ni}} to E-1 will give her a grey shiplock tag. She is now only able to sortie to E-1 and no other event maps.
* Sortieing {{ShipLink|Sendai/Kai Ni}} to E-2 in a ''single fleet'' will give her a green shiplock tag. She is now only able to sortie to E-2, and only in a single fleet composed of untagged or other green-tagged ships.
* Sortieing {{ShipLink|Jintsuu/Kai Ni}} to E-2 in a ''combined fleet'' will give her a blue shiplock tag. She is now only able to sortie to E-2, and only in a combined fleet composed of untagged or other blue-tagged ships.
* Sortieing {{ShipLink|Isokaze/B Kai}} to E-3 will give her a yellow shiplock tag. She is now only able to sortie to E-3 and no other event maps. Although you can use both a single and combined fleet in E-3, unlike in E-2 they both use the same yellow shiplock tag, so you can sortie Isokaze in either a single or combined fleet with no issues.

The number and scope of shiplocks varies from event to event, so checking the current event page for lock information before starting is always a good idea. This is also a reason to keep multiple ships per ship-type prepared. If you lack in certain ship-types, you may not be able to fulfill branching routes on later maps, or may be forced to use a sub-optimal composition.

Support expeditions do not check for ship locks, with the exception of the [[Summer 2014 Event]].
