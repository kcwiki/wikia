|Library = 艦隊旗艦として特化設計された新鋭軽巡洋艦、大淀です。<br>搭載予定の新型水偵の失敗や戦局の変化もあって、連合艦隊旗艦としてはあまり活躍できなかったの。<br>でも、北号作戦や礼号作戦では活躍したのよ。私も前線で、頑張りますね。
|Library/En = Designed as a cutting edge C&C flagship, the newest light cruiser, Ooyodo.<br>There was a problem with the installation of the specified new model recon, & the battle situation changed, so I wasn't really able to undertake my role as the combined fleet flagship.<br>However, I participated in the Northern Operation & the Battle of Mindoro.

==Character==
===Appearance===
*The NPC version wears simple heels for shoes, while the playable version wears platform heels with rudders acting as the heel. The playable version of Ooyodo has armor plating on her left leg, while the unplayable version does not.

===Personality===
*Ooyodo is normally paired with [[Akashi]], the other multi-duty NPC ship, and is likewise depicted as a foil to Akashi; Ooyodo is very serious and does not like to fool around, unlike Akashi, who is rather laid-back. Poking her evidences this as she will reprimand you for doing so, which apparently reflects poorly on the fleet.
*In the anime, Ooyodo is a serious assistant to [[Nagato]], the Secretary Ship. Ooyodo is also the one who dispatches the ships on their various operations. Unlike various other main or supporting characters, Ooyodo has not once been seen in combat, maintaining her old role as the Mission Girl.

==Appearances in Derivative Works==
[[File:Anime_oyodo.png|right|250px|thumb]]
* A supporting character in the [[Anime]].
** [[Anime/Characters#Ooyodo|Ooyodo's art was standardized]].
** [[Anime/Notes & Trivia#Eyecatches|Ooyodo was illustrated in the tenth eyecatch]].
{{clear}}

==Notes==
* Also the [[NPC#Multi-duty|Mission advisor &amp; Quest-musume NPC]].
** Initially, Ooyodo was not a kanmusu.
* [[Summer 2014 Event]], E-2 clear reward. In normal maps, she has an abysmal small chance to drop from 1-6 in node B.
* Has no {{Torpedo}} Torpedo or {{ASW}} ASW stats when stock & at level 1.
** Historically only mounted 15.5cm guns & AA weaponry.
** Is unable to attack submarines at level 1, even when equipped with {{EquipmentLink|Type 93 Passive Sonar|text=Sonars}}. (Presumably until she has at least 1 base ASW)
* She is currently the only non-time-limited source of obtaining {{EquipmentLink|Fleet Command Facility}}.

==Trivia==
* Named after [[wikipedia:Ōyodo_River|Ōyodo River]] in [[wikipedia:Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB|Kyūshū, Japan]].
* Intended as a command vessel for submarine operations - a scouting cruiser.
** As such, she traded torpedoes for additional seaplanes and is the only Japanese cruiser to lack torpedoes.
** Main armament was forward of the superstructure and aircraft facilities were aft.
*** Same as the [[:Category:Tone_Class|Tone class]], which were also intended as scouting cruisers.
* Never became a scouting cruiser and was converted to a command ship due to the war's progression and the [[wikipedia:Kawanishi_E15K|E15K1 ''Shiun'' floatplane]]'s failure.
* The flagship of the [[Historical Formations|Combined Fleet]] (30 April 1944 to 29 September 1944), as well as the flagship of [[wikipedia:Jisabur%C5%8D_Ozawa|Vice Admiral Ozawa]] after [[Zuikaku]] sunk during the ''Battle of Cape Engaño''.
* Capsized during the [[wikipedia:Bombing_of_Kure_(July_1945)|''Bombing of Kure'']] on July 28th, 1945.
** Spent the last half-year of the war in port.
** Subject to multiple air raids from [[wikipedia:Task_Force_58|Task Force 58]] and [[wikipedia:Task_Force_38|Task Force 38]] that left her repeatedly listing to starboard.
*** It was the same fleet with different command staff.
** Lives a new life as an Abukuma-class destroyer escort in the modern JMSDF.
