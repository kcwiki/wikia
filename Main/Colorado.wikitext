===Colorado Special Cut-In===
Colorado is capable of using a special attack which involves themselves, and the second and third battleship in the fleet.
====Activation Requirements====
*Colorado must be the flagship of the fleet.
*The flagship, 2nd and 3rd ship must not be at <span style="color:orange;">''chuuha''</span> or <span style="color:red;">''taiha''</span> state.
*The fleet must be in '''Echelon Formation''' (in Combined Fleet, '''Cruising Formation 2 (Forward)''').
*The 2nd and 3rd ship of the fleet must be a [[BB|Battleship]].
*The fleet Colorado is flagship in must have 6 ships in it (none retreated)
*No submarines (SS/SSV) allowed in fleet (Main for Combined Fleet)

====Cut-In Behavior====
*Upon activation, 3 singular attacks against randomly selected enemies will be performed. Each of the 3 ships participating will fire in succession.

*All the above modifiers stack multiplicatively.
**The multiplier is treated as '''post-cap''' in day battle, and as '''pre-cap''' in night battle.
*Can trigger at both day (first or second shelling rounds) and night battle.
*This attack may only trigger once per '''sortie''' (not once per battle).
**If the cut-in is not performed during battle, it can still be used in following battles.
*An additional 50% ammo will be consumed for this battle. (10% for day battle, 5% for night battle, 15% if both)

====3rd Shot Conditionals====
The 3rd attack does not enjoy equipment multipliers normally, and has to be a '''Big-7''' while following these rules:<br/>
'''If 3rd Ship is {{ShipLink|Nagato|Mutsu|Nelson|text=Big-7 Battleship}}:'''
* Equipment modifiers is dependent on if 2nd Ship either has AP/Radar equipped, or is a Big-7.
** If true, 3rd attack Equipment modifiers are based on 2nd Ship's equipment.
** Otherwise, 3rd attack Equipment modifiers are based on the 3rd Ship itself.

====5th Equipment Slot Bug====
There is currently an ongoing bug with Colorado's Special Cut-in attack, in which if the 2nd Ship has 5 equipment slots and an empty RE slot, and the 3rd ship is NOT a Big-7, the 5th Slot's item (If AP Shell/Radar) will be counted again as a separate multiplier for the 3rd Ship's total multiplier.

'''Example:''' If the 3rd Ship has an AP Shell + Radar equipped their bonus would be (1.35 * 1.15) from the equipment, but if there is another AP Shell in the 2nd Ship's 5th slot, the actual bonus would be (1.35 * 1.35 * 1.15) due to this bug.

==Trivia==
*The ''Colorado-class'' battleships were a group of 3 Standard-type battleships built in the inter-war years following the First World War as the first American battleships to mount 16-inch guns. ''USS Colorado'' was the nameship of her class, commissioned in 1923. She is considered as one of the "Big Seven" battleships of the inter-war years, alongside her sister ships USS Maryland and USS West Virginia, the Japanese [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]], and the British HMS [[Nelson]] and HMS Rodney.
*''USS Colorado'' saw a long and active career that took her into both Atlantic and Pacific oceans. She participated in a number of fleet exercises in the inter-war years, and also briefly served in various tasks such as becoming a training ship, and even assisting in the search for Amelia Earhart. 
*During the Second World War, USS Colorado saw extensive action throughout the Pacific against the Japanese, being a constant presence in pre-invasion shelling and fire support actions from Tarawa all the way to Okinawa. For her service, USS Colorado was awarded seven battle stars. 
*After the war ''USS Colorado'' participated in 'Operation Magic Carpet' to bring US troops back home. She was deactivated in 1947, and sold for scrap in 1959.
