===Appearance===

===Personality=== -->

==Character==
====Appearance====
*Her uniform is similar to that of the other two ships of the first three Kagerou-class vessels, Shiranui and Kuroshio, which consists of a school uniform with bike shorts under her skirt. The main difference between them is that each girl's neck ribbon is a different colour - Kagerou's is green. She has medium-length brown hair tied in twintails with a yellow hair ribbon and an ahoge.
*Her appearance changed upon her second remodel, hair ribbon color changed from yellow to white, her white gloves changed to black open-finger type gloves. Her main gun changed to Twin Gun Mount Model C with searchlight. The turret unit on the right was converted to a torpedo launch tube and a next loader was added behind the torpedo launch tube unit. There are 2 Triple Autocannon Mount unit installed in her belt. The blazer-like uniform jacket will blow away when moderately damaged, the left chest portion of the blouse will be ripped. Also that cute pout.

===Personality===
*Kagerou is cheerful, vigorous, and optimistic, and is very much a foil to her stoic sister [[Shiranui]]. She especially loves to dote on Shiranui as observed in some of her seasonal dialogue, but is also constantly looking out for her other sisters as well.
**In the dōjinshi ''Kagerou, Setting Sail!'', she stars as the eponymous main character of the novel. In said dōjinshi, she is a new transferee to the frontlines of the Yokosuka Naval District, setting out to prove to the others that she isn't just "a country bumpkin from Kure".

==Note==
*When remodeled into Kai Ni, Kagerou gains the ability to equip [[:Category:Extra_Armor_(Medium)|Medium Torpedo Bulges]].

==Trivia==
*Kagerou is the lead ship of her class.
*Sunk during a troop transport run from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabaul Rabaul] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolombangara Kolombangara] on 7 May, 1943 ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Kager%C5%8D_%281938%29&params=08_08_S_156_55_E_type:event_region:SB-WE_dim:300km 08°08′S 156°55′E]) along with Kuroshio and Oyashio.
*Her name translates to "heat haze".
**It was first carried by the fifth ship of the Murakumo class Torpedo Boat Destroyers in 1898.
*"Destroyer Kagerou Monument" and "15th DesDiv Memorial Monument" are built in the Long-duration Park of the former Navy Cemetery in Kure City, Hiroshima Prefecture.
*Although she's lead ship in her class, there's only a picture of her.
*IJN High Command changed the nameship of Kagerou-class destroyer to Shiranui-class destroyer after her sinking.

==Quests==
* Required by quests [[Quests#A32|A32]], [[Quests#A87|A87]], [[Quests#B21|B21]], and [[Quests#B116|B116]].
*Please note that quest A87 and B116 can only be done with Kagerou Kai
