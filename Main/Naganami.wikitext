==Character==
===Appearance===
* She has a long, multicolored hair that is black on the outside and pink on the inside. Although it's not obvious in her normal CG, her damaged CG reveals that she has large breasts.
* She wears the standard Yuugumo-class uniform, a purple sleeveless dress over a white shirt, blue bowtie and purple/grey pantyhose with a pair oflace-up boots.

==Notes==
*When remodeled into Kai Ni, Naganami gains the ability to equip [[List of Anti-Torpedo Bulges by stats|Medium Torpedo Bulges]], [[Fleet Command Facility]] and [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]].

==Trivia==
*Her name means "long waves".
*Went down in Battle of Ormoc Bay along with Shimakaze , Wakatsuki, Hamanami (this may explain her relative close sticking with Shimakaze in many fan arts).
*Her resting location [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Naganami&params=10_50_N_124_35_E_ 10°50′N 124°35′E]. Confirmed to be somewhat a little farther to the south from Shimakaze, as per RV Petrel's expedition in January 2018, who discovered her wreck along with Shimakaze and company.
