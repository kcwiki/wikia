The Mark 3 Model 3 RADAR (三号電波探信儀三型 ''san-gou denpa-tanshingi san-gata''), also known as the Type 33 Radar (33号電探), is is a remodelled version of the {{EquipmentLink|Type 22 Surface Radar|text=Type 22 Radar}}. In comparison to the Type 22, which was designed as a Shipborne Surface Search Radar, the Type 33 was designed as a Shipborne Surface Fire-control Radar. Three rectangular horn antennas (one transmitter and two receivers) were mounted on a Type 22 Radar frame. The device was completed during the final stages of the war, but wasn't installed on any vessel.
* It is mistakenly thought that this is a miniaturized version of the {{EquipmentLink|Type 32 Surface Radar|text=Type 32 Radar}}, it is not.
