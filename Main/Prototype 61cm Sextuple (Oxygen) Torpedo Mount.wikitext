The secret weapon that boasting high firepower and long range, the "Type 93 oxygen torpedo". Crammed full of those deadly oxygen torpedoes, these prototype sextuple "oxygen torpedo" launcher tubes held more firepower in one turret than the total available upon one of the older model destroyers. There were also plans to mount these on the later new model destroyers.
