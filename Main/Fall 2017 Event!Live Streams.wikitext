|Its your pal Serial here with the common, not rare at all, very very stupid mistakes frontline on all hard like I do every event but every event that goes by I become less and less confident in my skills and slowly understand why NA Frontliners are a near extinct race nowadays.

|Stream will commence around 5-6PM Pacific Time on Day 1. Definitely Easy-Normal Mode, but depending on reward, maybe Hard. Stream will be casual/interactive type. Will contain lots of salt during the stream.
