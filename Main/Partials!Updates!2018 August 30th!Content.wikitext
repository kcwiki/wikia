*The New Equipment released from this Month's Ranking Rewards will be released from a New Ship Girl scheduled for release in the [[Early Fall 2018 Event]].
*In addition to the usual rewards, starting from KanColle Phase 2 onward, Two new type of rewards for players who did not make it to top 500 will be introduced:

*Kiri-ban (キリ番): This is not easy to translate or find a suitable term in English, but basically it refers to numbers that have a (special) meaning. For example, 4649 can be read as "yoroshiku", 1234 for being consecutive numbers, 666 for being the devil's number.

*Fleet name & Player Profile Comment: Devs will first randomly pick players, and from there, look through their fleet name and comments. Selection criteria are based on these 3 criterias: "wabi-sabi (侘寂) - a kind of Japanese aesthetics", "makes you feel warm inside/fluffyness", "having a mysterious appeal".

*The above 2 groups of players will receive the same rewards as players in the top 500 bracket (101-500).

*For this time round (July ranking rewards), the fleet name/comments are chosen from a certain point in this month. 
**From August ranking rewards and onward, the Fleet Name/comments will be chosen from the last day of their respective month.
