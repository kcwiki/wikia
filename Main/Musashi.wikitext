==Character==

=== Appearance ===
* Musashi has short pale blonde/light brown hair in two side up style and twintails with her hair coming down between her eyes. She has brown or red eyes and wears glasses. Her body type is distinctive among shipgirls, generally depicted as tall, with dark skin, and large breasts. Her clothing is likewise distinctive, with a red miniskirt, black thighhighs, an iron collar with an Imperial Chrysanthemum Seal off of which hangs a small capelet,black gloves, and bandages wrapping her making her only upper torso clothing a functional budget sarashi. The only visible difference in her remodel art is that her red skirt and capelet turns black.
* Her combat gear includes a large, back-mounted "split hull" design with smokestacks behind her back, and battleship hull-like arms bristling with multiple triple-cannon turrets, both larger "main guns" hanging over her shoulders and smaller "secondaries" popping out of the sides of the hull. A third "main gun" is clamped to her right thigh. Also on her thigh, she has armor piercing ammo cartridges strapped to metal garter straps. She also wears armored high-heel like boots with rudders for heels.

=== Personality ===
* Musashi sports a boastful, battle-hungry personality, contrasting with the more reserved Yamato. Her looks and personality stem from how the actual battleship's sinking involved taking an incredible amount of punishment although, unlike Yamato, she never actually engaged in surface combat. This may also be in oblique reference to the fact that she shares part of her name with the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi.

==Trivia==
* [[Development|LSC]] craftable since July 4th, 2014.
* [[#Notes|Due to the discovery of Musashi's wreck]], the March 13th, 2015 update included dedicated furniture & a slight construction drop-rate increase.
** The drop-rate was reverted during the March 27th, 2015 update.
* Has dark skin due to [http://ww2db.com/ship_spec.php?ship_id=3 her hull being painted a darker color and her deck being blackened with soot. The camouflaging attempts were all made because of the upcoming Operation Sho-Go which resulted in the naval battles in the area of Leyte Gulf].
* In her Kai Ni form. She resembles an unfinished ship design of the IJN titled "Project A-150" or famously known as "Super Yamato" class Battleship. The battleship was projected to carrying three 51cm (20,1") dual gun mount, thus increased her weight. This design also projected to carrying huge number of 10cm HA Dual Gun Mount to protect her against aircraft, learned from the cause of sinking for both Musashi and Yamato.
