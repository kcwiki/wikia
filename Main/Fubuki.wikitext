==Character==
[[File:AnimeFubuki.png|thumb|200px]]

=== Personality ===
* Fubuki has an earnest and diligent personality.
* Though she lacks many personality quirks, it is seen in the anime that she takes her idol, Akagi, to high regard, dancing around in bliss after a simple pat on the head.
* In the 4-koma, it is revealed that Fubuki is able to speak Russian, and she does so fairly well; she even speaks it better than [[Verniy]] does. This is a reference to her voice actress, Sumire Uesaka, having a major in the Russian language. Despite this, [[Miyuki]] claims that she and [[Shirayuki]] could also do the same if they tried.

* ''Fubuki'' means "blizzard" or "snowstorm".
** That name was first carried by the sixth Torpedo Boat Destroyer of the Harusame class in 1903.
* When introduced, the [[:Category:Fubuki Class|Fubuki class]] (Special Type I) were among the most powerful destroyers in the world.
* Sunk in the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Cape_Esperance|''Battle of Cape Esperance'']] on October 11th, 1942, by cannon-fire from USS San Francisco and USS Boise.
* Wreck located on January 27, 2015 by Paul Allen's RV ''Petrel''. Based on the single pic released, she is upright on the bottom, but her exact condition is unknown.
* She was originally the heroine of the game, and was later chosen as the main character in the Anime and in the official [[Merchandise/Manga#Fubuki.2C_Ganbarimasu.21|4-koma]].

==Quests==
* Composition: [[Quests#A47|A47]].
* Sortie (Clearance): [[Quests#B35|B35]] & [[Quests#B36|B36]].
