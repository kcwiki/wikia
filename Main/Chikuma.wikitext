== Character ==
===Appearance===
* Chikuma has long black hair and black eyes. Unlike her sister, she's curvier, often shown with large breasts. All of her models are identical to her sister ship Tone.
* In her unremodeled form she wears a green dress with puffy short sleeves, a low belt, and a bowtie. She wears a single black thighhigh on her left leg and a thigh strap on her right leg. She also wears a single black elbow glove and lace-up black boots.
* In her remodeled form she wears a green top matching her unremodeled state except it is now more elaborate. Her belt now goes to her upper waist and her boots are no longer lace-up. The most noticeable change in clothing she gets is a long, black side-slit skirt that creates a pelvic curtain. It also gives off the impression that she doesn't wear any panties.
=== Personality ===
* Chikuma is very levelheaded and mature. She's also very devoted to her sister Tone, and is always worried about her wellbeing. She's always seen taking care of Tone and has stated that she wants to become stronger in order to protect her.
