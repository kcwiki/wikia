Expedition 32 is a special expedition that allow players to gain more experience from it. It requires Training Cruisers (e.g. [[Katori]] and [[Kashima]]) as a flagship and currently, only Katori is available through drops and construction, while Kashima is 6-5(boss node) drop only. However, ships accompanying the training cruisers will obtain EXP in different scales depending on what level range they are in and what level range the training cruisers are in.

Different models have been proposed to explain behavior of Expedition 32 for now.

The general Formula for all of them are:

(Base*Random (100%/200%) Multiplier*Great Success Multiplier+Flagship lvl Bonus)*Ship lvl Multiplier
