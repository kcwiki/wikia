|Library/En = I'm the Second Furutaka Class Heavy Cruiser, Kako.<br>I achieved quite a feat during the Battle of Savo Islands!<br>Ah, the way back? Well, the verse "Going in is easy, but returning is scary" was no joke!
|Library/Note = Battle of Savo Island is known as "the First Battle of Solomon Sea" in Japan. The verse "行きはよいよい、帰りは怖い" is from a warabeuta(playsong) "通りゃんせ" (To-ryanse).[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dryanse]
The battle was a one-sided rout in favor of the Japanese but on the return to Rabaul Kako was torpedoed by American submarine S-44 and sank rapidly.

==Character==
===Personality===
* She's unwilling to get anything done most of the time, and she tends to fall asleep right after coming back from a sortie, or at other less conventional times. When she ''is'' aware, however, she's boisterous, hot-blooded, with a distinct love of fighting.

==Trivia==
* Sunk August 10, 1942 by ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_S-44_(SS-155) USS S-44]'' off [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savo_Island Savo Island] at [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Kako&params=02_28_S_152_11_E_ 02°28′S 152°11′E].
* Her name was originally intended for the 4th Sendai-class light cruiser, but her construction was cancelled after the Washington Naval Treaty. The name "Kako" was already registered in the records, so the IJN decided to reuse her name when starting construction on a new class of heavy cruisers. This is why "Kako" is named after a river, instead of a mountain which would follow standard IJN nomenclature for large displacement ships. It is also why Furutaka is the lead ship, even though Kako was the first ship to be laid down.
