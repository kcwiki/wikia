== Character ==
===Appearance===
* She has black hair in a pair of braids, sidelocks and hair between eyes in front, and has black eyes. She along with her sister-ships wears a "basic"serafuku with a white and dark blue color scheme of blouse and blue pleated skirt.
* In her combat gear, she wears her rigging as a form of backpack, while carrying two torpedo mounts on both sides of her thighs. Her twin-cannonturret is wrist-mounted.
=== Personality ===
* She has a shy, nervous, and "girly" personality, which makes an odd pairing with her "younger sister" Uranami, since Uranami's lines make her sound reliant upon the guidance of the older Isonami in spite of Isonami being generally far less sure of herself than the rather enthusiastic Uranami.

==Trivia==
*Sunk in action, April 9, 1943 at [[wikipedia:Buton|Buton Island]] (near [[wikipedia:Sulawesi|Celebes island]]), [[wikipedia:Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch East Indies]] (now [[wikipedia:Indonesia|Indonesia]])

*Her name means "Breaking waves".
