==Character==

===Appearance===
*Fumizuki wears a black serafuku with a white tie, a black dress and black stockings. She has brown hair with the Mutsuki-class' distinctive crescent moon-shaped trinket on her collar.
**After her second remodel, she wears the same outfit as [[Satsuki]] does post-second remodel. Her rigging has changed substantially, such as her switching out her old 12cm cannons for new twin-barreled ones. 25mm cannons are seen mounted on her rigging. Her crescent moon-shaped trinket has now been relocated to her necktie; interestingly, this was where Satsuki's trinket was pre-second remodel.

===Personality===
*Fumizuki is innocent and childlike. She speaks slower than other members of her class, and like some other ships, has a tendency to speak in third person.

==Notes==
*Fumizuki's Kai Ni form allows her to equip [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]] and all its variants.
==Trivia==
*Sunk in air attack February 18, 1944 at Truk at 07°24′N 151°44′E.
* Wreck discovered in April, 1987 in 130 ft. of water by writer/ diving enthusiast Yoshimura Tomoyuki.
* Her name is an archaic word for "July", specifically the seventh month of the outdated lunar calendar.
* Received her Kai Ni on July 31, 2017

== Quests ==
* Required by Quests [[Quests#A49|A49]], [[Quests#A79|A79]], [[Quests#B39|B39]] and [[Quests#B104|B104]].
