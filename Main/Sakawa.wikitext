==Trivia==
*Originally assigned to accompany [[Yamato]] during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ten-Go Operation Ten-Go].
*Taken as a war prize by the United States and was used for repatriaton efforts, turned over to the United States Navy on February 25, 1946.
*Used as target on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads Operation Crossroads] at Bikini Atoll on July 1, 1946. Sunk one day after the Able nuclear test.
*While at Eniwetok, five of its American sailors were angry over the dismal working conditions aboard Sakawa. In a ship normally staffed by over 730 men, the U.S. Navy used a crew of 165 doing the work of 325. The five sailors sabotaged the ship by removing the pressure line to the over-speed trip valves in the fuel system and pouring sand into the oil and water pumps. They smashed gauges, tachometers, and cut high pressure steam lines in an attempt to get relieved of duty aboard the filthy warship. Rather than being relieved of duty, the five sailors were brought up on charges. In May, after emergency repairs, Sakawa reached Bikini Atoll.
