After taking heavy damage from U.S submarines, she managed to survived and reached Sasebo for repairing, but due to lack of resources, she was left there hulking until the surrendering of Japan. An U.S technical team was sent to evaluate her damage and deemed her constructive total loss, thus she was broken and scrapped.

==Character==

===Appearance===
*The Hiyou class wears a white blouse with red trimmings over a red dress shirt referencing their past as army-subsidized luxury passenger ships and a magatama for their tops. Their bottoms are a wide red hakama trimmed to calf-length and wear platform shoes. Their flight decks are scrolls while the airplanes are shikigami, controlled as onmyouji.

** Jun'you herself has a distinctive hairdo with long, spiked purple hair which appears similar to the wings of a bird in flight. This is in keeping with her name which uses the kanji for both falcon and hawk.

===Personality===
*Is an extreme drunkard, like [[Chitose]]; the two are often depicted in the manga together imbibing sake.

==Trivia==
*Her name translates to "peregrine falcon".
*Scrapped on 1 June, 1946 after failing an inspection by the US as a [[wikipedia:Marine_insurance#Actual_total_loss_and_constructive_total_loss|constructive total loss]].
*Originally a passenger liner called ''Kashiwara Maru'' (橿原丸). The navy bought and converted her into a carrier.
*Her name suffered a misinterpretation by the US Navy after the Battle of Midway; this was because a Japanese POW from the battle reported her name as "''Hayataka''", this being her Chinese characters read with their Japanese readings, or "kun'yomi" (訓読み), rather, the right way to read it is via the Chinese derived "on'yomi" (音読み).  
*Her occasional "battlecry" （ヒャッハー！） and her fan nickname within the Asian player community ([http://wikiwiki.jp/kancolle/?%C8%BB%C2%EB 世紀末空母] or Carrier of the End Century) are both references to Fist of the North Star.
*The Kanji on her hands (both normal and Kai Ni) means "Imperial Edict" (勅令) while on her Kai Ni damaged art, it's read as "Forbidden" (禁).
* Received her Kai Ni on 29/08/2014.
