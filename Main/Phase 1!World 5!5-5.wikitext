===Tips===
*You must sink the Boss [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class|Standard Carrier Wo-class Kai Flagship]] '''5 times''' to clear the map.
*Clearing this map rewards 1 [[Medal]] and 200 [[Experience_and_Rank#Monthly_Ranking|ranking points]]. The boss HP bar is reset at the beginning of each month, allowing the reward to be obtained again.
*Nodes C, H, K, and M are night battles.
*Having 4 ships capable of equipping [[Drum Canister]]s ([[DD]]/[[CL]]/[[CAV]]) and a total of 5 Drum Canisters will take you to node B. Other compositions will always take you to node A.
*Fleet with 3 [[SS]] or more will take you to node F where there are enemy CLs and DDs with ASW equipment.
*Fleet with only fast ships will take you to node D. It is possible to bring slow ships if the fleet has 2 [[CV]] and 1 [[CVL]]. Other composition will take you to node C where you will meet 6 enemy SS in night battle.
*There is a sub at the boss node. Getting S rank at the boss is possible, but '''not''' recommended. It is advisable to ignore the sub and just focus on killing the boss.
*Fleet Compositions
**High endurance ships are recommended (Yamato-class, Iowa, Shoukaku-class armored carriers, etc.), with anti-torpedo bulges equipped in expansion slots due to the threat of the high firepower and high torpedo Re-class battleships throughout the map.
**With all carrier compositions 420 air power (plus 5-10 extra if utilizing jet aircraft) for achieving air supremacy at the first node and superiority/supremacy at all subsequent nodes is desired.
**'''3 [[BB]], 2 [[CV]], and 1 [[CVL]]''' high firepower and survivability (Yamato-class BB are preferable). Consider not bringing [[Saiun]] with this composition. This composition often utilizes a flagship CVL with no bombers equipped.
**'''1-2 [[FBB]] and 5-4 [[CV]]''' is also recommended. This strategy focuses on a powerful opening airstrikes with many torpedo bombers.  [[Saiun]] can be used with this composition to boost contact rate along with 1-2 seaplanes and named torpedo bomber squadrons.
**Using exactly three submarines in the map ('''3 [[BB]] and 3 [[SS]]''') routes A-F-G-N. However, pre-boss support shelling is needed to increase consistency of the submarines surviving. This route has the advantage of guaranteed boss routing, making it good for experienced players with high-end equipment and ships.
***Other variants include '''1 [[CV]] 2 [[CVB]] and 3 [[SS]]''' [https://i.imgur.com/sLnCrTr.png] which has greater consistency surviving enemy ASW without support, but lower overall firepower at the boss node.
***'''1 [[Musashi Kai Ni]] 2 [[CVB]] and 3 [[SSV]]''' can be utilized as well, with seaplane fighters on submarines and Musashi Kai Ni to augment air power.
