==Character==
===Appearance===
*Hatsukaze wears a uniform identical to that of [[Maikaze]]'s; a school uniform-esque garment with a vest and a yellow neckerchief.

===Personality===
*Hatsukaze is very cold and hostile towards her Commander/Admiral, but she is only shown to be doing so because she wants the Admiral to be stronger. She shows a strong amount of admiration towards not of a ship of her class, but to [[Myoukou]], a heavy cruiser; this is most likely due to historical reasons.

==Trivia==
*Her name means "First Wind".
*Sunk in action, 2 November 1943.
**Was heavily damaged shortly before sinking from a collision with [[Myoukou]], thus explaining her connection with the heavy cruiser.
