Ingame, a ship equipped with both a Sonar and Depth Charge will have a 15% damage boost against enemy submarines.<br />This bonus only applies once per ship (i.e A second pair of Sonar/Depth Charge equipped on the same ship will '''NOT''' gain another 15% boost)

Equipping a Seaplane Tender with a Depth Charge along with a Seaplane Bomber will increase damage against subs.
*Green : Outstanding
*Yellow : Above average
