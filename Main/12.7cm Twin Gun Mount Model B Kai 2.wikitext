This is main cannon of destroyers with minor changes. It is quite identical with the base form, having a fully shielded turret for protection against shrapnel and the elements, and also with an improved gun elevation. It is said to be mounted aboard destroyers, such as on the Yuudachi.

* This gun is the modified version of the twin gun ''Model B'' which was used by Ayanami-class and Akatsuki-class destroyer. The main difference between the Type A and Type B is that instead of the former's elevation range of −5° to +40°, type B's range is upgraded to 75°, which is required for the more complicated and effective AA systems installed on newer destroyers. Type B armor, however, was too thin to withstand heavy seas and splinter damage, so the Type B Kai was introduced, adding more protection.
* First mounted on Hatsuharu-class destroyers, but the effectiveness is unknown.
