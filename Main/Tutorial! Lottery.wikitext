'''Are there people who are willing to help newbies who is unable to enter the lottery?'''
*Check [http://www.himeuta.net/f49-lottery-help/ Kancolle forum] for lottery help, there are people out there who will help others to make a account for those who did not manage to get into the lottery.
'''I got (or stuck) into the lottery process, although the lottery hasn't started/has ended already.'''
*''Set your timezone to Japan/JST.''
'''What time does the Lottery start?'''
*Check the twitter for the exact time by looking through the [[Tutorial:_How_to_Register#Finding_Lottery_Info|lottery info]] .
'''Why is it so hard to get in? I have been trying for a few days!'''
*You are competing with thousands of other users for spots, keep trying and don't give up hope.
*Don't be impatient and refresh more often than recommended on the screen, as it will lower your chances.
'''Do I have to do this every time I want to play?'''
*No, you'll have to win the lottery only once.
'''Official twitter said registration is now open, but why I kept getting catbomb before being able to successfully enter the server selection screen?'''

No known reason nor solution have been figured out. All we can recommend is to re-check timezone, cache, etc. Failing that:
*Try to switch to browser's incognito mode.
*Switch to other browsers.
*Try a different VPN to connect.
*Try switching to another computer. 
If all these are not working, try again another day.
