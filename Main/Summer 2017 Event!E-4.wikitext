===Historical Fleet: European Ships===
All the ships used in historical routing are from European countries:
* CA(V): {{ShipLink|Pola}}, {{ShipLink|Prinz Eugen}}, {{ShipLink|Zara}}
* (F)BB(V): {{ShipLink|Bismarck|Bismarck drei|text=Bismarck}}, {{ShipLink|Richelieu}}, {{ShipLink|Roma}}, {{ShipLink|Littorio|text=Littorio/Italia}}, {{ShipLink|Warspite}}
* CV(L): {{ShipLink|Aquila}}, {{ShipLink|Ark Royal}}, {{ShipLink|Graf Zeppelin}}
* AV: {{ShipLink|Commandant Teste}}
* DD: {{ShipLink|Z1}}, {{ShipLink|Z3}}, {{ShipLink|Libeccio}}

Meeting the historical requirement allows you to bring a CLT in your fleet while still being able to skip a node.

==Map Guide==
*This is a combined fleet map.
*Node D is a submarine node.
*This map has two phases, each requiring you to defeat the following bosses:
** The first boss is {{ShipLink|Aircraft Carrier Summer Demon}} at Node I
** The second boss is {{ShipLink|French Battleship Princess}} at Node N
*Path from Node D to G is not available during the first phase, necessitating the player's fleet to take the long route to boss node I.
* One [[Land Base Aerial Support]] is available for sortie in this map.
** 3 range minimum is required to reach the 1st phase boss node I.
** 6 range minimum is required to reach the 2nd phase boss node N.

===Tips===
*There does not appear to be any speed-based branching on this map. It is a good place to use your slow BB(V)s and slow CVLs.
**It is especially the last map you can use your best slow ships for the main battle. Starting from E-5, there will be several restrictions on usage of Slow-Ships.
***If you have saved your {{ShipLink|Yamato}} and/or {{ShipLink|Musashi}}, it is recommended that you use them in this map, as the next Extra Operation maps will have slow-ship based restrictive branching rules.
*CTF with the proper requirements starts at A, while a STF always starts at D. As the routing always forces you to go D -> A during the first phase, starting at node A is more advantageous.
** Using 1 BB 2 CA 2 CVL 1 CV in your first fleet as a CTF can be changed to a STF with only one substitution (swap the CV for another BB) allowing to avoid shiplocking more ships than necessary.
**However, after unlocking the 2nd phase, using TCF and CTF will force you to node I. This also means that you cannot complete E-4 without the use of a STF.
** After you unlock the 2nd phase, D -> A routing is no longer forced. This makes node I a very attractive farming spot, as you only have to go through a sub node and 2 empty nodes to be able to reach the boss.

===Possible Fleet Composition===
*'''Phase I'''
**{{Event/Route|D|red|A|red|B|red|C|red|G|blue|H|blue|I|red}}:
***Surface Task Force
****2 (F)BB(V) / 2 CA(V) / 2 CVL + CL / 2 CA / 3 DD
**{{Event/Route|A|red|B|red|C|red|G|blue|H|blue|I|red}}
***Carrier Task Force
****1 (F)BB(V) / 3 CA(V) / 2 CV  + 1 CL / 2 CA(V) / 1 CLT / 2 DD
****1 (F)BB(V) / 3 CA(V) / 2 CV + 1 CL / 1 FBB / 2 CLT / 2 DD

*'''Phase II'''
**{{Event/Route|D|red|G|blue|H|blue|J|red|K|red|M|red|N|red}}
***Surface Task Force
****2 (F)BB(V) / 2 CA(V) / 2 CVL + CL / 2 CA(V) / 3 DD
****2 (F)BB(V) / 1 CA(V) / 2 CVL /  LHA  + CL / 2 CA(V) / 3 DD
***European Surface Task Force (Must have European Ships of 3 for Hard, 2 for Medium, 1 for Easy)

****4 BB / 1 CA(V) / [[Akitsu Maru]] + 1 CL / 2 CA(V) / 1 CLT / 2 DD
**{{Event/Route|D|red|G|blue|H|blue|I|red}} '''(for farming node I)'''
***Transport Escort Fleet

===Ship Special Buff Effect===
*All European ships have post cap damage bonus against {{ShipLink|French Battleship Princess}}
*Most noticeable with {{ShipLink|Prinz Eugen}} setup with Torpedo Cut-In.
**Also noticeable with {{ShipLink|Warspite}} and {{ShipLink|Bismarck}}.
***Estimated to be at least 1.3x
