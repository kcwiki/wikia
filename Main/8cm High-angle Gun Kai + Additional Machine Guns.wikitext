An improved version of the newly developed long 8 cm high-angle gun.<br/>It was intended as a smaller lightweight anti-air secondary battery version of the long 10 cm high-angle guns that were mounted on the Akizuki-class. Although its performance was regarded as questionable by some, it was nonetheless expected to function as anti-air armament on new vessels. This piece of equipment is the combination of an improved version of the long 8 cm gun whose peculiarities were its small size and light weight, and single autocannon mounts arranged around it, all in a single anti-air armament package.
