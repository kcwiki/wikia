|Introduction/Note = 

|Introduction/Kai = 提督、ごきげんよう。潜特型の長女、一番艦、伊400、しおんです！呼び方、少し馴染んできました？お、そう？じゃ、今日もご一緒に。
|Introduction/Kai/En = Admiral, good day to you. I'm the eldest of the Sentoku-class, the 1st ship, I-400, Shion! Have you gotten used to calling me by that yet? Hmm? Really? Then let's spend another day together!

|Library = 潜特型、伊400型潜水艦、その一番艦、伊400です。対艦船用戦術潜水艦ではなく、戦略運用のために建造された、新コンセプトの潜水空母なんです。もちろん艦載機は晴嵐さん！戦う前に矛を収めてしまった私たち姉妹、きっと覚えていてくださいね。
|Library/En = Sentoku-class, I-400 model submarine, the first ship, I'm I-400. Rather than an anti-ship combat submarine, I was constructed for the purposes of strategic operations - a new concept submarine carrier. And of course, my planes are the Seirans! Make sure to remember me and my sisters, whose battle was ended before it could even begin, okay?
|Library/Note = 

|Secretary 1 =  お？しおん、行けますよ。
|Secretary 1/En = Oh? Shion, ready to go.

|Secretary 3/Note = Seirans were stored in her hangar folded up, with floats detached. She is holding them in her hand. They would be reattached right before the take-off using a pair of special slides next to the catapult track.

|Secretary 3/Kai = 晴嵐でしょ？うん…やっぱり気になりますか？あ、そうです！フロートはこっちから。うん…ね？あ、すごい！上手です！
|Secretary 3/Kai/En = The Seiran, yes? Right... you really are interested in them, then? Ah, that's right! The floats are over here. Hmmm... right? Ah, amazing! You're good at this!

|Idle = うん…そうですね。しおいちゃんと一緒に運河へ？いいですね。提督もご一緒にぜひ！楽しみです。そうですね。いつか必ず。
|Idle/En = Hmm... that's right, go to the canal with [[I-401|Shioi]]? That would be so nice. You're welcome to come along too, Admiral! I'm looking forward to it. That's right, we'll definitely go one day.
|Idle/Note = 

|Secretary Married = 提督、あの…肩、凝ってません？揉んであげましょうか。しおん、結構うまいんですよ？あ、硬！うっ…ううっ！どうですか。

|Starting A Sortie/Kai = いい、しおいちゃん、いよちゃん、ひとみちゃん? 第一潜水機動部隊全力出撃。抜錨です！
|Starting A Sortie/Kai/En = Alright, [[I-401|Shioi]]-chan, [[I-14|Iyo]]-chan, [[I-13|Hitomi]]-chan, the 1st Submarine Task Force is sortieing at full strength. Weigh anchor!

|Sunk/En = Ngh, I see... this is sinking... I'm going to go on ahead okay, [[I-401|Shioi]]? Give this... bell... to that person...
|Sunk/Note = Likely a reference to Captain Ariizumi Tatsunosuke, captain of Submarine Division 1. When ships are scrapped or sunk, their bells are a tangible memorial to their services during the war; the real I-400's bell was recovered in March 2016 and is now pending preservation at the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum.

*[[Fall 2017 Event/E-3|Fall 2017 Event E-3]] drop.
==Trivia==
*Laid down in January 1943 I-400 and her sisters were the largest submarines in the world at the time. Designed not for torpedo hunting but launching floatplane attacks there was a grand-plan to block the Panama Canal. However this never came about, and she spent most of her short life training, and then when the plan was given the go-ahead the war ended before she got near.
*She was tested and paraded by the US before being sunk in June 1946 both as a test and denial to the Soviets. Her wreck was discovered on August 1, 2013.
*Her ship's bell was salvaged on March 2, 2016 and is currently undergoing conservation at the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park at Pearl Harbor.
