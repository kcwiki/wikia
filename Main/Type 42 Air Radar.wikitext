The Type 14 was a shipboard system designed for long-range, air-search applications. With a peak power of 100 kW and operating at 6 m (50 MHz), this weighed a huge 30,000 kg. Only two of these systems were placed in service in May 1945, just at the end of the war.

However the illustration of the air radar probably based from the captured [[wikipedia:SCR-268 radar|SCR-268 radar]], which was reversed engineered by both IJA and IJN in a rare cooperative effort.
