|en = A what-if improved version of the light cruiser medium caliber twin and single mounted gun developed by the prestigious Swedish company. The original gun's anti-air capabilities were limited, it was capable of high degrees of elevation for use as an anti-air gun. It also had a mechanism that allowed it to reload while elevated which increased its effectiveness at anti-air even more. It was mounted on the Dutch light cruisers.
