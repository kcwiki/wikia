|en = The cutting-edge carrier-based fighter Reppuu was developed as a successor to the famous Zero fighter. The original high-altitude interceptor Reppuu Kai was further developed and perfected for anti-fighter combat and carrier-based usage, its angled guns were removed, and its performance was improved to create this two-seater Reppuu Kai 2. This hypothetical night fighter Reppuu Kai 2 also has enhanced on-board radar. It will open up new tactics for Japan's kidou butai.
