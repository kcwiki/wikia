While not directly referenced by name, the formal definition of the [[wikipedia:Director_(military)|director]] is an [[wikipedia:Fire-control_system|fire-control system (FCS)]] (火器管制装置). Slightly different from radar in that the FCS/director finds a possible point in which the bullet will arrive ''at''. [http://wikiwiki.jp/kancolle/?91%BC%B0%B9%E2%BC%CD%C1%F5%C3%D6 As demonstrated on wikiwiki]:<br>
> ''Radar: "The enemy is over here!~ Here is contact!~"''<br>
> ''FCS: "Um, the enemy has exposed themselves, so I think this shot angle is good!~"''
