__NOTOC__
[[Partials]] is a pseudo-namespace (a prefix) that is used for content that is or might be required by multiple articles and/or has a configurable inclusion scheme (via [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates#Parameters parameters]). Generally, it should be accessed from inclusion places (see below for a list of pages and inclusion places), but also can be used (and commented) by itself.
