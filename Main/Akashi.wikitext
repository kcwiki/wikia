|Library/Note = During the war Akashi operated out of the Japanese base in the Truk atoll where she repaired various types of battle-damaged Japanese warships, including the Shoukaku in October 1942 and the Yamato in December 1943.
In February 1944 the Americans made a raid on Truk (Operation Hailstone), sinking and damaging many ships. Akashi was damaged in these attacks and escaped to the Japanese atoll of Palau.
On 30 March 1944, while anchored off Urukthapel in the Palau islands, Akashi was hit numerous times by bombs and rockets from American aircraft from Task Group 58, during Operation Desecrate One. She was sunk in shallow water with her bridge and cranes still remaining above the water

== Character ==

===Appearance===
*All versions of her wear a serafuku (identical to Ooyodo's) on top of a long-sleeved zippered shirt and a blue pleated skirt with hakama-like hip vents. The NPC version only has white stripes along the brim while the playable version has a wider red stripe on the brim. Both versions wear thighhighs.
*The NPC version simply has a crane attached to her with a ribbon. Her shoes are simple heels.
*The playable version wears pieces of armor, propeller platform shoes and she has several cranes attached to her ship parts.
*Once remodeled, she wears a white bandana and actual weapons (mostly anti-air guns) are attached to her.
*She has long pink hair with freshly cut strands held by red tress ribbons, as well as green eyes.
===Personality===
*Akashi is depicted as a foil to Ooyodo; Akashi is much more laid-back and cheerful than Ooyodo is. She is very protective of her equipment, especially her cranes, and gets nervous when she is sortied as she lacks any real firepower.
*Naturally, she is usually paired with fellow NPC ship-girl Ooyodo. She is also occasionally paired with Yuubari, usually featuring their mutual love of tinkering with and improving equipment.

==Drop Availability==
*[[World 1#1-5|World 1-5]] Boss node (only for players who do not possess her in their fleet). S rank required. 
*[[World 2#2-5|World 2-5]] Boss node (only for players who do not possess her in their fleet). S rank required.
*[[World 3#3-5|World 3-5]] Node F and boss node (duplicate drops available on both nodes). S rank required.

==Akashi's Improvement Arsenal ('''改修工廠''')==
When set as the secretary, Akashi enables the improvement of certain equipment in the game. Refer to [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] for more information.

==Anchorage Repair ('''泊地修理''')==
{{ShipLink|Akashi/Kai|text=Akashi}} uses as many [[Ship Repair Facility|Ship Repair Facilities]] as are in the inventory that will fit in her slots and will repair herself and the ship in slot 2 by default when set as the flagship, plus one ship slot per [[Ship Repair Facility]] equipped. Only ships above 50% HP can be repaired using this system. Up to a total of 6 ship slots can be repaired with four Ship Repair Facilities of them equipped. It is theoretically possible to repair up to 28 ships at once with 4 unlocked Docks, and 4 Akashi flagships, each equipped with 4 repair facilities, including the Akashis themselves.

She takes at least 20 minutes to repair all ships by at least 1 HP. Above 20 minutes, she repairs as much HP as the repair docks would in the same amount of time, rounded down, when she is interrupted (by returning to the HQ screen). For instance, if a ship takes 36 minutes to repair 4 HP for instance and she is interrupted at the 35 minute 59 second mark,she will repair only 3 HP - but she would repair 4 HP if the interruption happened merely one second later. If the fleet composition is changed, the timer is reset with zero HP repaired. The cost and time required of repairs are the same as those used in [[Docking]] otherwise.

It is possible to get her to repair ships faster than the docks would if the ship takes more than 20 minutes per HP in the docks by interrupting her every 20 minutes.

The following actions will not reset the timer and are safe to do while utilizing Anchorage Repair:
*Sending other fleets on sortie
**Note that when applicable, while sortieing with a 3rd fleet strike force, the first fleet can be used to repair.
*Sending and receiving expeditions
*Construction, development, improvement
*Accepting and completing quests

The following actions WILL reset the timer:
*Changing the repairing fleet composition
*Sending the repairing fleet on sortie or expedition
*Returning to the home port screen if the timer is over 20 minutes elapsed


'''ONLY SHIPS WITH LIGHT DAMAGE OR GREATER HP WILL BE REPAIRED BY {{ShipBattleCardKai|Akashi/Kai|flagship=true}}'''


<!--
With Akashi set as the flagship, she can repair both herself and a damaged ship in position #2 in her fleet. She becomes able to repair the ship in position #3 as well, when she has a [[Ship Repair Facility]] (艦艇修理施設) equipped. Each addition of this equipment to her inventory will allow her to repair an extra ship at the same time. Up to 4 Ship Repairing Facility items can now be obtained through multiple Akashis via drop, which allows Akashi to repair ships in all slots with all 4 facilities equipped.
*Her repairing is carried out in the form of 'ticks' every 20 minutes.
*She must '''remain as the flagship for 20 minutes''' before each tick of repair carries out.
*The '''repair target(s), including herself, must not sustain damage greater than minor damage '''(小破). Ships with moderate damage (中破) and greater will not be repaired. The same rule applies to herself.
*'''''Changing the spot of any ship in the fleet will reset the timer'''''.
*Sending the fleet to sortie will not reset the repair timer. But if the repair timer is tick during sortie with Akashi, the ship will not get repaired.
* If Akashi is being repaired in a dry dock then she will not start repairing until you open the HQ screen and "reset" her timer.
*She will continue to repair while the player is offline, just like the dry docks.
*Her repair is not affected by fatigue.
*She doesn't need a Ship Repair Facility to repair herself and the 2nd ship.
* Her repair will function when she is flagship of not just the 1st fleet but also the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fleets.
*Repairs with Akashi take the same amount of time as repairs done in the docks +- 20 minutes
*'''It costs the same amount of resources to repair using Akashi as long as Akashi is not [[#Interrupted Repair Cost Calculation|interrupted]] . '''


'''Note: '''
: Akashi '''does not repair''' fleet ships if she is being repaired in a dry dock, she must be active in the fleet for her repair to work. Minor damage will '''not''' affect Akashi's ability to repair ''other'' ships, but beyond that she will be unable to repair anyone, same rule apply to herself as if damages had cease her repair functionality. 
:

==='''<u>Total repairs required</u>'''===
Total number of ticks required to fully repair a ship can be calculated by refering to the dock repair time
*'''Total repairs (ticks) required = (Hours x 3) + (minutes / 20) + (seconds / 1200) '''

Example: <span style="line-height:14px;">For an Aircraft Carrier with 04:31:20 dock repair time</span>

 (4 x 3) + (31 / 20) + (20 / 1200) = 13.5667 ticks.


===='''<u>Amount of HP repaired per tick</u>'''====
*'''HP lost / Total repair required '''

Example: <span style="line-height:14px;">For an Aircraft carrier with 62/75HP and require 13.5667 repairs (ticks)</span>
 (75 - 62) / 13.5667 = 0.95119


===<u>'''Minimum Repair Cost'''</u>===
*AKA cost per tick​ if interrupted at the first 20 minutes(first tick), or actively interrupted every 20minutes. 
*The minimum repair cost depends on
**Ship class
**Amount of HP repaired per tick
*The minimum repair cost can be generally calculated using
**'''[[#Amount of HP repaired per tick|HP repaired per tick]]  x [[#list of Ship Class Repair Cost|Ship Class Repair Cost]] '''
*Verification of accurate ship class cost is currently in progress.

For example: For the same Aircraft Carrier mentioned above, if interrupted at 20 minutes, minumum repair cost applies. 

 Fuel Cost = 0.95119 x 2.1 = 2
 
 Steel Cost = 0.95119 x 4 = 4


====<u>'''Interrupted Repair Cost Calculation'''</u>====
*The total cost required to repair a ship will increase if Akashi is interrupted during repair.
*Example of repair interruption :
**Entering the main menu page from other pages
*If the repair was interrupted at 20 minutes (first tick), '''minimum repair cost applies, '''refer above'''.'''
*If the repair was interrupted after 40minutes or later, the cost will be
**'''[[#Minimum Repair Cost|minimum repair cost]] x (Amount of HP repaired before the repair was interrupted + 1) / 2'''


Condition for interruption:
* Fleet composition change on fleet where Akashi is repairing the ships
* Removing her ''Fleet Repair Facility'' equipment while doing repair to a ship other than 2nd slot.
** However, adding more of this equip will '''NOT''' reset the timer. Instead, Akashi will immediately start repairing the ship on that slot from the next tick or when the timer is reseted.


For example: For the same Aircraft carrier mentioned above, if Akashi repaired 8 HP before being interrupted, interrupted repair cost applies.
 Interrupted Repair Fuel Cost = 2 x (8 + 1) / 2 = 9
 
 Interrupted Repair Steel Cost = 4 x (8 + 1) / 2 = 18

==Trivia==
*NPC [[NPC|Premium shop and LSC ship]].

*The only specialized repair ship operated by the IJN (the other two were cancelled).
*Escaped [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hailstone Operation Hailstone] on Truk in February 20, 1944, fled to Palau.
*Sunk while anchored in Palau on March 30, 1944 during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Desecrate_One Operation Desecrate One].
*Salvaged and scrapped in 1954.
*Akashi had 17 different factories within her body. Factories included furnace and anvils amongst other things - a mobile manufacturing complex.
*Out of the 779 crew in her, 443 were mechanics, which was not limited to military personnel.
*Had 2 chimneys. The front chimney was used to exhale smoke from the factories - the one you see around her right arm.
*Had power generation capabilities that rivalled the [[Yamato]] (4800kw) in order to power her machines.
*Had German machinery loaded, allowing her to have unparalleled reparation abilities compared to standard onshore factories. Her ability to repair ships efficiently was what made her a priority target by the Americans.
*Her name was first carried by the second and last protected cruiser of the Suma class in 1899.
