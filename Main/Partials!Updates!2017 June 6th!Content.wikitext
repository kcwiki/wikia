===[[Kumano Kai Ni]]===
{{SeasonalGallery|slideshow=true|Kumano/Kai Ni|Kumano/Carrier Kai Ni}}
There are two forms: ''[[CAV|Aviation Cruiser]] (Kai Ni)'' and ''[[CVL|Light Carrier]] (Carrier Kai Ni)''
*{{ShipLink|Kumano/Kai Ni}}
**Requires level 84+
*** Requires a [[Blueprint]]
*** No Stock Equipment
*{{ShipLink|Kumano/Carrier Kai Ni}}
**Requires level 88+
***Converted from {{ShipLink|Kumano/Kai Ni}}
***Requires another [[Blueprint]]
***No Stock Equipment
***'''Additional Info & Mechanics'''
****Works exactly the same as {{ShipLink|Suzuya/Carrier Kai Ni}}
****Officially known as ''"Fast Light Attack Carrier"''
****Her ship type is CVL, but with the following peculiarities:
*****When there are '''no''' surface ships (Ex. DD/CL/CA/BB/CV(L)) present in the enemy fleet she '''will''' attack submarines just like a regular CVL.
*****When there '''are''' surface ships present in the enemy fleet along with a Submarine she '''will''' attack surface targets like a standard CV.
*****(Ex. An enemy surface fleet escorted by a submarine is presented. Kumano CVL will ignore the SS and attack the surface ships; however, if all surface ships are sunk, then she will attack the submarine.)
****After Suzuya Carrier Kai Ni and {{ShipLink|Taiyou/Kai Ni}}, she is the third Medium-ranged CVL in the game.
*'''Important Notice'''
**Kumano Kai Ni to Kumano Carrier Kai Ni '''requires''' a Blueprint no matter what.
***This means that if you had reverted her back into a CAV, it will cost you another blueprint if you try to remodel her back to a CVL again afterward.
***Remodeling Kumano Carrier Kai Ni back into Kumano Kai Ni (CAV) '''does not''' consume a Blueprint.
