===Is it possible to complete a map with TP gauge on easy for most of it and then revert back to hard for final kill?===

No, it works '''exactly''' the same way as HP gauge. Even if you reset the difficulty after completing TP gauge you '''will''' have to redo the TP gauge again.

===Will I be able to get duplicates of [[Prinz Eugen]], [[Graf Zeppelin]], [[Akitsushima]], [[Akizuki]], etc?===

Yes, the only exceptions are [[Graf Zeppelin]] and [[Prinz Eugen]]. [[Graf Zeppelin]] has been confirmed by the developers themselves to be unobtainable if you already have one in possession <ref group=FAQ name=Graf />. According to reports, they still can drop if you get rid of the one you have in possession <ref group=FAQ name=Graf1 />, <ref group=FAQ name=Graf2 />.

===Why I can't enter E3 after completing E2?===

You have to finish the event-special quests to enter E-3. RG01 will clear itself when you complete E-2. As for RG02, you need to complete expedition #175 while the quest is active.

The expedition #175 can be done with 6XX ship (Any 6 ships of your choice). Flagship must be Level 6 or higher.{{Cite}}

===What is this new aerial-node like thingy in E1 outer route and E2?===

The new type of aerial node is a bombing raid from land-based planes (listed in the API as Long Distance Air Battle), where battle rank is determined by damage taken and air superiority status.  It's not possible to damage the enemy airfields, presumably due to their very long bombing range. These nodes consume 8% fuel and 4% ammo.<ref group="FAQ" name=LDAB /> (If a kanmusu's total fuel/ammo is not divisible by 4%/8%, the cost will be rounded up.)

The tentative conditions for the ranks are as follows
:*Perfect S: Take zero damage from the airstrike. Annihilation of enemy bombers isn't necessary.
:*S: ?
:*A: Take less than 10% damage<ref name=LDAB />
:*B: Take 10%-20% damage<ref name=LDAB />
:*C: Take 20%-50% damage<ref name=LDAB />

The mechanics for lower ranks are still under investigation. Threshold values require further validation.

===Can I go back to the Transport Escort Area in E-3 after depleting the TP Gauge?===

===What ships would be required for ship-specific routing, or being extremely helpful, in different maps?===

===Will Iowa-class appear as this event's rewards? The devs have promised these 'Murican ships for the upcoming event, right?===

Well, yes and no. Yes; they'll come eventually, but during this spring at its earliest. However, they're not guaranteed to arrive during the Spring 2016 Event, nor are they specified to be introduced as event rewards for the matter.

This also means the Iowa-class certainly won't be showing up as the event's reward just yet, so please wait patiently for their arrival and make do with this event's reward (which includes one of the Akizuki-class destroyers) until then.
