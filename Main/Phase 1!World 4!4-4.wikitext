===Tips===
* Recommended fleet composition: 2DD/1CAV/2BB/1CV, 2DD/1CAV/1BB/2CV
*F and I are Submarine Nodes. There is also a Submarine in the boss's evolved fleet. If possible, equip one of your destroyers for the preemptive anti-submarine attack.
**Keep in mind that destroying the submarine is '''NOT''' necessary, you only have to sink the flagship to lower the gauge. Be careful that you don't unnecessarily use {{Seaplane}}Seaplane Bombers if you do not have an OASW ship available, as that forces the ship to attack the submarine.
*2 DDs are needed to go from node A to node F. 1 CA/CAV is needed to go from Node F to Node G. This is the easiest way to the boss (A-F-G-H)
*G to H (boss) or J is random.
*This will be your first map outside of extra operations where simply defeating the boss node is not enough to 'defeat' the map. You must kill the flagship boss around '''FOUR''' times before being allowed to pass. Keep in mind that the boss node changes at 25% of the map health (i.e., after SINKING the boss 3 times), usually to a 'stronger' form.
**The boss gauge does '''NOT''' regenerate.
**To unlock World 5, you need to defeat the boss of World 3 too.
