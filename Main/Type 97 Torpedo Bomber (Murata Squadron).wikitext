Shigeharu Murata was a highly skilled torpedo bomber pilot who led the first attack wave on Pearl Harbor. Attacking from [[Shoukaku]], his squadron heavily damaged the USS Hornet, who was already under attack by dive bombers. During the attack, however, Murata's plane was hit, prompting him to crash it into the carrier in an act of suicide, disabling her for good. The squadron lost a large, irreplaceable amount of skilled pilots through this assault.
* Historically, this plane squadron is from [[Akagi]] during the attack on Pearl Harbor, then transferred to [[Shoukaku]] after the Battle of Midway.
