:''For special effect on non-installation enemies like [[PT Imp Pack]]<!--, [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]], or [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]]-->, please refer to each of their own pages.''
'''Abyssal Land Bases''', otherwise known as '''Installations''', are enemies representing land-based military fortifications and facilities. While categorized as various different ship classes within the game, they have numerous differences from ordinary ships that grant them unique defensive strengths and weaknesses against shipborne weapons.

==General Rules==
*Cannot be attacked by [[List of Torpedoes by stats|Torpedoes]]. Torpedo stat is considered as 0 while attacking Installations. Torpedo-based attacks will either not activate (In Night Battle) or cannot target Installations (In Torpedo Phase)
**An exception to this occurs when the ship has no equipment equipped. <ref>https://twitter.com/noratako5/status/707937418020651008</ref>
*Submarines will be able to attack installations during shelling phase if equipped with {{EquipmentLink|Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank}}
**Note that submarine can attack them during the night regardless of equipment.
*Dive Bombers and Torpedo Bombers are able to attack Installations during the Opening Air Strike.
**Torpedo Bombers, however have their torpedo stat treated as 0, and thus is only able to deal scratch damage.
*Cannot be attacked by Carriers equipped with [[List of Dive Bombers by stats|Dive Bombers]] during the shelling phase, '''unless''' equipped with the following bombers: <ref>https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/1110889611591507971</ref>
**{{EquipmentLink|Suisei Model 12 (634 Air Group w/ Type 3 Cluster Bombs)}}
**{{EquipmentLink|Prototype Nanzan}}
**{{EquipmentLink|F4U-1D}}
**{{EquipmentLink|FM-2}}
**{{EquipmentLink|Ju 87C Kai}}
**{{EquipmentLink|Ju 87C Kai Ni (w/ KMX)}}
**{{EquipmentLink|Ju 87C Kai Ni (w/ KMX/Skilled)}}
*Carrier are unable to perform cut-in attacks on installations in Daytime Shelling.
*Equipping Anti-Installation equipment deals bonus damage against them.
*Installations come in 3 different sub-classes, BB, BBV and CV.
**BB-Type Installations use the normal shelling formula and continue to shell past Moderate Damage
**BBV and CV-Type Installations use the carrier shelling formula and are disabled once past Moderate Damage.
*Can be identified by their speed (None).
*Special damage labels are shown when damaged:

=== '''Quick Guide''' ===
{{Hard Anti-installation Weapons}}

==Damage Bonus==

Damage against Installations is calculated as follows:<br />

<math>
\text {Attack Power} = \operatorname{cap} \left ( ( ( (\hat{F} + I_{sub}) \cdot I_{pre} ) + I_{flat} ) \cdot M \right ) * I_{post}
</math>

Where:
*<math>\hat{F}</math>is the ship's calculated '''shelling''' stat after equipment and improvement have been added (Refer to [[Combat/Damage_Calculation]])
*<math> \operatorname{cap} </math>is the soft capping operation. (180 for Daytime shelling, 300 for Night Battle)
*<math>I_{pre}</math>is the final multiplier of all eligible anti-installation pre-cap multipliers.
*<math>I_{flat}</math>is the sum of all eligible flat pre-cap bonuses.
*<math>I_{sub}</math>is the submarine flat pre-cap bonus.
*<math>M</math>is the special attack modifier (e.g double attack) of any eligible attack.
*<math>I_{post}</math>is the final multiplier of all eligible post-cap multipliers.

===Bonus Tables===
The following table is the known multipliers of anti-installation equipment versus various types of installations. With the exception of Supply Depot Princess, all multipliers listed are '''Pre-cap''' multipliers, unless otherwise specified.

*Land-Based Attack Aircraft benefit from both Airstrike multipliers.
*Seaplane Bomber/Fighter bonus works even if the slot size is 0.
*{{EquipmentLink|Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)}} has an additional further improvement bonus against Supply Depot Princess, where the improvement multiplier is multiplied again.
*Supply Depot Princess is considered as Soft-skinned, and all Soft-skin pre-cap multipliers also apply to her.

To Note:
*With the exception of the bomber bonus, Flat damage bonuses are '''pre-cap'''

===Others===
These are Installations that (might) behave differently in regards to damage, and haven't been categorized in the above categories.

====[[Central Princess]]====
*Takes increased damage from dive bombers and seaplane bombers during opening stages.

====[[Central Princess#Damaged|Central Princess Damaged Form]]====
*Takes increased damage from WG42 and Type 2 Tanks. However, using both of them together cancels Tank bonus.[http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:DynamitMC/2016_Spring_Event_E-7_Hard_Mode_Last_Kill_Preparation_Thoughts#2.29Bonuses_against_Central_fucking_go-fuck-yourself_hime_.28damaged_form.29 <nowiki>[4]</nowiki>]

====[[Anchorage Water Demon Vacation Mode]]====
*Unlike her normal version, is considered a surface ship, and thus torpedo stat and relevant attacks are able to harm her.
*Takes increased damage from anti-installation equipment, in particular from {{EquipmentLink|M4A1 DD}} and ships with multiple Dive Bombers equipped.
**The damage multipliers also apply to torpedo attacks that are aimed at her as well.

==Ship Type==
Despite those enemies are installations, they do have the "ship type" parameter which influence their behavior in battle.

Currently, there are Aviation Battleship, Battleship, and Carrier Installations.

:Aviation Battleship type: Most Installations belong to this type, firepower calculation same as carriers, shelling attack animation in both day battle and night battle [in browser game version], cannot attack in day battle if heavily damaged.
:Battleship type: Artillery Imp and Central Princess, firepower calculation same as battleships, shelling attack animation in both day battle and night battle, '''can''' attack in day battle even if they are heavily damaged.
:Carrier type: Lycoris Princess, firepower calculation same as carriers, '''carrier attack animation''' in day battle and shelling attack animation in night battle, cannot attack in day battle if heavily damaged. Killing them count toward carrier kill quest.
