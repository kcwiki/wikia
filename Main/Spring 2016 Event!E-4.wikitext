===Branching rules===
*This map is a [[Combined_Fleet|Combined Fleet]] map.
'''Carrier Task Force''' starts at 1.
*B → C or B → D is selected by the player.
**If Fast Battleship(s) are present in the Escort fleet D → E → F.
**If slow fleet, also D → E → F, otherwise D → F.
**Offroute condition for F → L unknown.
'''Surface Task Force''' starts at 2.
*2 or more CLTs will go to C
**3 CLTs will go C → H
**2 CLTs + 1 AV will go C → E?
***4FBB, 2CVL + 2CLT, 1AV, 1CL, 2DD (all fast ships) went C → H
***4FBB, 2CVL + 1CL, 1CLT, 1CA, 1CAV, 2DD (all fast ships) went C → H
***4BB, 2CVL + 2CLT, 1AV, 1CL, 2DD also went C → H
*G → H → I chance is higher with more Battleships in the fleet. 1 FBB and fast fleet seems safe for G → I.
*Otherwise G → I.
**Offroute condition for J → L unknown.
**FBB, BBV, 3CA, CV + CL, 5DD seems to route G - I - J - K

===Tips===
*Node F (North Route preboss) has a CV Hime
*Node J (South Route preboss) has a BB Hime
*Using '''Carrier Task Force''' is arguably the easiest way to clear the map, but it is not recommended for farming due to the high bauxite usage (reaching up to 1k per sortie with air base sortieing as well)
*A fairly consistent way of neutralizing the threat of Node F (CV Hime) is assigning the airbase's slots with 4 Reppuu (or any equivalent, high-AA fighters) and targeting it twice. When used in conjunction with Akizuki-class AACI, the repeated rolls of AA defense plus said AACI can easily disable the CV Hime by shooting down the entirety of her bomber squadrons.
*In either route, Fast Fleets skip submarine nodes{{clear}}
