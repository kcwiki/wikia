* A reinforced motor boat used for transport by the IJN, it was used in a number of operations and evacuations throughout the war. It could hold up to 11 tons of weight, 70 soldiers, 1 Type 89 I-Go tank or 10 cavalry horses.
* The company that made the landing craft, Tokyo Hatsudoki Corporation, is still in operation renamed as Tohatsu. They are still making motor boats and boat engines as well as fire pumps and accessories. Their major manufacturing plant in Tokyo was spared from the USN fire bombing and at the end of the war, their focus on producing military equipment shifted to domestic production to hasten economic recovery and post-war reconstruction. Few such product include manual grinding mills for food, fishing boats, motorcycles and engines to power Japan's early rail cars, which were key in reconstruction.
* The landing craft has no relation to Japanese car maker Daihatsu.
