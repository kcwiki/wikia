The Type 1 Armor Piercing shell is an improved version of the secret Type 91 Armor Piercing shell fired from long range cannons. It is intended to work by plunging into the sea, striking the hull below the waterline of the enemy ship like a torpedo. It has better performance than the Type 91, and has colored dyes for identification and target assists. It can be equipped on battleships, aviation battleships and fast battleships.
