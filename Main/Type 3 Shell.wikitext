A special kind of main battery shell used by battleships that is specifically used as an anti-air weapon. The shrapnel, when ejected from the bullet in large quantities, potentially encases and then annihilates all enemy planes in formation. The questionable accuracy rate of the firing mechanism of the main battery of battleships is the only weakness, but this is traded for the immense AA firepower boost. Can be used on Battleships, Aviation Battleships, Heavy Cruisers, and the like.

* Development requires at least 10 [[File:Fuel.png|20px]], 90 [[File:Ammunition.png|20px]], 60 [[File:Steel.png|20px]], 30 [[File:Bauxite.png|20px]], with Ammo as primary resource for a drop rate of 6%, Fuel/Steel as primary resource for a drop rate of 4%. Isolated reports exist of successful development with Bauxite as primary resource at probability ~ 6%.
* Quest [[Quests#B40|B40]] reward.
* Grants increased damage against most "[[Installation Type]]" bosses such as [[Airfield Princess]], [[Isolated Island Demon]], [[Northern Princess]] or [[Midway Princess]]. Some of these bosses were based on real-life airfields, of which the Type 3 shell was designed to destroy. This bonus increases [[Damage_Calculation#Basic_Attack_Power|Basic Attack Power]] by 250% when attacking regular installations. This bonus is added before [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|WG42]]'s bonus and does not stack.

The '''Type 3 Shell''' (三式弾 ''sanshikidan''), also known as '''Type 3 Common Shell''' (三式通常弾 ''sanshikitsuujoudan'') or '''Type 3 Incendiary Shrapnel Shell''' (三式焼霰弾 ''sanshikishousandan'') were AA rounds which contained hundreds of incendiary-filled steel tubes. The incendiary filling was "Elektron" metal (45%), barium nitrate (40%) and rubber (14.3%) together with sulfur (0.5%) and stearic acid (0.2%). Besides their incendiary effect, the steel tubes also acted as shrapnel. A time fuze was used to set the desired bursting distance, usually about 1,000 m after leaving the muzzle. These projectiles were designed to burst in a 20° cone extending towards the oncoming aircraft with the projectile shell itself being destroyed by a bursting charge to increase the quantity of steel splinters. The incendiary tubes ignited about half a second later and burned for five seconds at 3,000°C, producing a flame about 5 m long. These shells were thought to have a larger lethal radius than did standard HE AA rounds.

The Type 3 shell was first deployed in 1942 for 20 cm and larger guns and in 1943 for the [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount]] and [[12.7cm Twin Gun Mount]]. The 46 cm Type 3 shells for the Yamato-class battleships may have been nicknamed "The Beehive" but this could be apocryphal. 

The concept behind these shells was that the ship would put up a barrage pattern through which an attacking aircraft would have to fly. However, the US Navy pilots considered them to be little more than fireworks and not an effective AA weapon.
