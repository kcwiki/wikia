==Character==
===Appearance===
* Just like another Maestrale-class destroyers, her real-life identification mark "ML" is imprinted on her skirt.

===Personality===
==Notes==
==Trivia==
*Her name means North-West Wind
*Completed in 1934, she served until 1943 when she was badly damaged by a mine needing repairs. When the Italians surrendered a few months after she was scuttled.
*Her mentions of mines and anchor chains refer to the circumstance of her damaging on 9 January 1943. While escorting a merchant ship, Maestrale had her stern destroyed by a mine, leaving her drifting without rudder or propellers.Maestrale drifted towards more minefields, but the crew managed to stop the ship by connecting the two anchor chains and thus obtaining a longer anchor chain that allowed them to anchor the ships in 300 meters of water. She was later reached by other ships and towed to safety.
*Her name lives on as the Italian navy's [[wikipedia:Maestrale-class frigate|Maestrale-class frigate]].
