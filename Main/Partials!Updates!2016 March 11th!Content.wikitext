* New map: [[6-4]]
** New land-based target, [[Isolated Island Princess]] and [[Artillery Imp]]
*** They are not the ordinary "soft skin" type land-based target, so their defensive characteristics are different from those regular "soft skin" type land-based target
**** Especially for [[Artillery Imp]], they are "pillbox" type land-based target, Type 3 Shell is not effective against them
*** Multiple effective equipment exist to deal with them
** This map is the first map implemented Air Raid Node into regular maps
** Announced drops: {{ShipLink|Hayasui}} (confirmed as boss drop), {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}} (node L drop), {{ShipLink|Mizuho}}, {{ShipLink|Tokitsukaze}}, {{ShipLink|Yuugumo}}, {{ShipLink|Asagumo}}, {{ShipLink|Yamagumo}}
