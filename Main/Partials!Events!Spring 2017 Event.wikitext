==Hints and Advice==
* Make sure your fleet is prepared in all departments (Ex. Do not neglect your AV, SS, and/or AO).
* Make sure to prepare a large amount of resources.
**Give at least 1 month of time to start stockpiling your resources. 
* Make sure to prepare a good amount of Aircrafts with good stats, especially with large range for [[Land Base Aerial Support]] and for your Aircraft Carriers (Ex. Do not neglect your Skilled Aircraft Conversion Monthly Quests as they give good aircrafts and are excellent to use in [[Land Base Aerial Support]]).
* Do not jump into the Event on Day 1 if you aren't a Frontliner. Wait for the Frontliners to gather/publish confirmed fleet compositions and branching rules for each Event Maps. Be patient.
** Some Information may turn out to be false or half-confirmed so please be patient until all information are verified first.
* Most important advice: Keep your sanity high. 

==New Ships/Equipment==
* Escort Carrier (Taiyo?)
* Foreign Battleship
