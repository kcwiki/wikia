The FuMO25 radar is a ship-borne radar developed from another country. It is unfortunate that this electronic equipment from the country of science is superior to the radar equipped by our combined fleet. It is mainly used aboard cruisers or any other larger warships.

*FuMO stands for Funkmess-Ortung in German, and is a radar classification.
*Although {{ShipLink|Prinz Eugen/Kai}} has this radar equipped upon remodel, records state that she carried the FuMO 81 ''Berlin-S'' Radar instead of the FuMO 25. Spec wise, the FuMO 81 was far superior, as it had a 50% wider range. It also had a higher frequency of 3300 MHz compared to the 368MHz the FuMO 25 used.
