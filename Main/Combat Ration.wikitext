* The Combat Rations are a new type of item that can be outfitted in equipment slots.
:* Can be equipped in [[Reinforcement Expansion]] slots as well.
:* In the event of '''three or more pre boss nodes''' in a sortie, the item will randomly be consumed before the battle starts.
:** The chance of Combat Rations being consumed randomly is as follows:<br />
<math> \text{Activation Chance} = 10 + 2 \sqrt{L} + ( N * 5 )  </math><br />
Where '''L''' is the ship's Luck Stat and '''N''' is the number of battle nodes passed.
:** Upon activation, any food items on the fleet will be consumed.
:** The activating ship will randomly gain 6-10 morale, increased to 20-28 morale if also equipped with {{EquipmentLink|Canned Saury}}.
:** Adjacent ships will randomly gain 2-4 morale, increased to 16-20 morale if {{EquipmentLink|Canned Saury}} was also used.
:* After the [[Thread:414346|1 April 2016 update]], this item can be used entering the boss node (regardless of current ship morale).
