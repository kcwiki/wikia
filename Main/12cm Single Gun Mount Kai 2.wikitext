|en = An improved version of the small caliber standard main gun mounted on older destroyer models. Despite its manual loading and traverse mechanisms, it's been used for a long time as the main armament of destroyers, mostly thanks to its simple structure and low production cost. This new version greatly improves the actual combat performance, it cannot, however, be used for anti-aircraft purposes.
