The carrier fighter squadron of "Type 0 Fighter Model 52C"'s that includes Flight Leader Iwai with his clever piloting skills. The "Model 52C" had improved firepower and armor to oppose the enemy's new models of planes. In exchange some agility is lost, but the clever piloting skills of the experienced aircrew will make up for it.

Tsutomi Iwai was a skilled fighter pilot who was assigned to [[Zuihou]] at the start of the war providing air cover in many sorties and engagements. Halfway into the war, his squadron kept taking heavy loses, eventually having to borrow some pilots from the 601st Air Group, making him the leader and in charge of mentoring his new pilots. His squadron was then moved to [[Zuikaku]] for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, once again losing half of his squad members, forcing him to land on Luzon, Philippines due to Zuikaku sinking.
*He was nicknamed "Zero Fighter God" by his young pilots, impressed by his acrobatics.
*This version represents his time before the end of The Battle of Leyte Gulf.
