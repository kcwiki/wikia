|Introduction = 翔鶴型航空母艦2番艦、妹の瑞鶴です。幸運の空母ですって？そうじゃないの、一生懸命やってるだけ…よ。艦載機がある限り、負けないわ！
|Introduction/En = Second of the Shoukaku-class aircraft carriers, the younger sister Zuikaku. The lucky carrier, you say? That's not it, I just fight with all my might... As long as I have planes, I won't lose!
|Introduction/Note = Zuikaku ran out of planes, in the end.

|Introduction/Kai Ni = 航空艤装を全面的に近代化改装したこの瑞鶴、普通の正規空母だとは、思わないでね！
|Introduction/Kai Ni/En = It's me, Zuikaku, with a full modernization on all of my carrier rigging. Be advised that this is not your ordinary standard carrier.

|Library = 翔鶴型航空母艦２番艦、瑞鶴です。<br>翔鶴姉と共に、ミッドウェーの後の第一機動部隊の中核として、矢尽き刀折れるまで奮戦しました。<br>文字通り、最後の機動部隊が壊滅する、その日まで…。

|Library/Note = Zuikaku and Shoukaku did not participate in Midway, and were upgraded to 1st CarDiv due to the loss of Akagi, Kaga, Soryuu, and Hiryuu; she was the last carrier of the Kidou-butai to be sunk, and thus the IJN's aviation power, was lost
'矢尽き刀折れるまで' lit 'Until the arrows are expended and the sword broken' is to fight until you have no more resources left

|Equipment 2/Kai Ni A/En = New model airplane. Hmm... Sounds good to me. It's definitely compatible to my current rigging.

|Equipment 3 = いい感じじゃない！
|Equipment 3/En = Feels good!

|Equipment 3/Kai Ni = よしっ！いい感じじゃない！
|Equipment 3/Kai Ni/En = Yes. Feels good!

|Supply = 燃料、弾薬…艦載機も補充しておくね
|Supply/En = Fuel, ammo... planes are all fueled up and ready to go.

|Docking Minor = 少し、お風呂に入ってくるね
|Docking Minor/En = I'm going to the bath for a bit.

|Docking Major = まぁ、私だってたまにはケガするし
|Docking Major/En = Well... Even I get hurt sometimes, huh...

|Attack/Kai Ni A/En = Now, let's get started. This time we'll definitely strike from outer range. All strike wings, take off!

|Night Battle = 七面鳥ですって…？冗談じゃないわ！
|Night Battle/En = Turkey, you say...? Stop fooling around!
|Night Battle/Note = The IJN's low pilot quality late in the war led to the so-called 'Turkey Shoot' at the Marianas, where the planes were shot down quite easily by the US fleet.

|MVP = やったぁ！見たか！これが五航戦の本当の力よ！瑞鶴には幸運の女神がついていてくれるんだから！
|MVP/En = Yay! Did you see that! That's the true power of the CarDiv5! The Goddess of Luck is with me!
|MVP/Note = There is a bit of irony here. Zuikaku herself claimed that she fought with all her might (Introduction), but in this line, she also said that Goddess of Luck was with her. Zuikaku may deny that she was lucky, but she also admits that Luck had a part to contribute to her achievements.

|MVP/Kai Ni = よぉし見たか！これが新しい五航戦の本当の力よ！瑞鶴には幸運の女神がついていてくれるんだから！

|Sunk = うっ…私も逝くの…？ 総員飛行甲板、翔鶴姉、待っていてくれるかな…
|Sunk/En = Oohhh... Am i done for...? All hands, to the flight deck... Shoukaku, are you waiting for me...?
|Sunk/Note = During the sinking of Zuikaku, all of her crew went up to the flight deck and gave a mass salute while the ship was slowly sinking.

==Character==
[[File:Anime zuikaku.png|thumb|250px]]

===Appearance===
* Zuikaku wears a shortened miko uniform with arm bracers and thigh boots with propellers protruding from them. Like most archer carriers, she wields a bow, and wears a muneate. Her muneate has the katakana ス (su), which when voiced becomes ズ (zu), the first kana of Zuikaku's name, refering to her identification mark in real life.
* Zuikaku has long grey (or green or black) hair in twintails. Her flight deck is attached to her left arm.

'''''Upgrade'''''
* Unlike [[Shoukaku]], her clothes changes color after remodeling. Her skirt becomes brown; her top is now a bluish grey; her muneate, flight deck, arm bracers and quiver on her back gain a geometric camouflage pattern. Said camouflage pattern is based off the real life ship's camouflage scheme following her 1944 remodel.

===Personality===
* Zuikaku has a brash, prideful personality, and can be overly confident at times. However, some of her lines imply that she has a more caring side, at least towards her sister, [[Shoukaku]].
* Also depicted as being a tsundere.

==Notes==
* Requires [[Prototype Flight Deck Catapult]] for her Kai Ni remodel.
* Upon reaching level 90, Zuikaku Kai Ni is capable of remodeling into '''Kai Ni A''', which upgrades her into an armored carrier with better overall stats and the ability to use jet-powered and heavy aircraft at the cost of smaller total aircraft capacity.
**Like her sister [[Shoukaku]], Zuikaku Kai Ni A also has the unique feature of being capable of switching back and forth between her Kai Ni A and Kai Ni forms via remodeling.
**Zuikaku must first be remodeled into Kai Ni in order to unlock the option of remodeling into Kai Ni A.
**As an armored carrier similar to [[Taihou]], Zuikaku Kai Ni A is capable of launching aircraft during the shelling phase even while in a medium damage state.
**Switching between forms not only requires an expenditure of Ammo and Steel like with normal remodeling, but also requires Development Materials. (15 for from Kai Ni to Kai Ni A, 10 for from Kai Ni A to Kai Ni)
***Modernization losses still apply when remodeling from/into Kai Ni A.
*Zuikaku at her Kai Ni and Kai Ni A forms is the second carrier ingame after [[Shoukaku]] to have an attack range of Medium instead of Short.

==Trivia==
*Her name translates to "auspicious crane".
*Zuikaku was the youngest carrier that participated in the attack on Pearl Harbour.
*Zuikaku, alongside with her sister [[Shoukaku]] was considered the fastest carrier in world war 2.
*Zuikaku participated in almost every major operation in Pacific War except Midway.
*Her real-life counterpart is indeed lucky; the real-life ''Zuikaku'' never took a single hit until June 1944 at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea battle of Phipippine Sea] (at the expense of her sister, [[Shoukaku]], who always took heavy blows).
**This is reflected in her high Luck stat in-game.
*The camo pattern of her upgraded model clothes refer to the actual flight deck camouflage pattern used during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf Leyte Gulf] battle, the same pattern was used on [[Zuihou]], [[Chitose]] and [[Chiyoda]].
*Sunk by air attack in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf Battle of Leyte Gulf] on 25 October 1944.
* One day after her Kai Ni release, the game staff updated and corrected her graphic, after her illustrator posted an image file about Zuikaku Kai Ni art onto twitter together with a question mark, which showed the original illustration with the game graphics, showing the latter having skewed proportions to the original.
