This attack aircraft was developed for use on airfields with anti-shipping as its primary mission. With its long range and capabilities in anti-shipping as well as ground attack, this plane, dubbed the chūkō, (medium attack plane), was organized as the back bone of the naval base aviation during its early days. Its successor is the famous Type 1 Attack Bomber.
