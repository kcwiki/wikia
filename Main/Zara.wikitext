==Notes==
* [[Winter 2016 Event]] E-3 clear reward.
* Available from [[Construction|Large Ship Construction]] with either [[Libeccio]] or [[Pola]] as flagship from 25 January 2017 update.
* Her historical counterpart was not equipped with torpedo launchers, and this is reflected in Zara having a base torpedo stat of zero and being unable to perform torpedo attacks. However, equipping her with launchers and/or raising the torpedo stat above zero via modernization will allow her to perform torpedo attacks.
* The 24 February 2016 update enabled the Italian battleships and heavy cruisers to launch [[List of Seaplanes by stats#Seaplane Bombers|Seaplane Bombers]] (such as [[Zuiun]] and [[Prototype Seiran]]) while retaining their current classification after remodeling.
* Zara Due is the only pure Heavy Cruiser (i.e. not an Aviation Cruiser) capable of equipping [[Skilled Carrier-based Aircraft Maintenance Personnel]], and she is also the only Heavy Cruiser capable of equipping the [[Type 96 150cm Searchlight]].

==Trivia==
* Named after the city of Zara (today [[wikipedia:Zadar|Zadar]], in Croatia). The city was named Zara when it was under the authority of the Republic of Venice in the 15th century.<ref>[[wikipedia:Zadar#Etymology_and_historical_names|Zadar (Etymology and historical names) - Wikipedia]]</ref>
* Crippled by RN battleships' shellfire during the [[wikipedia:Battle of Cape Matapan|Battle of Cape Matapan]], and eventually finished off by the destroyer HMS [[Jervis]] at 02:40, 29 March 1941.
* Her lines about [[Pola]] are a reference to the setting of her loss in the battle mentioned above; her sister ship [[Pola]] was crippled by a torpedo and fell behind, so Zara and her division (another cruiser, ''[[wikipedia:Italian cruiser Fiume|Fiume]]'', and four destroyers) were sent back to provide help. The British ships were thought to not be that close, and the lack of radar precluded the possibility of spotting them before it was too late.
* Zara is the first ship in-game to receive a ''due'' upgrade. ''Due'' means "two" in Italian, analogous to [[Bismarck|Bismarck zwei]] and later, [[Gangut|Gangut dva]].
* Zara's seaplane launcher after receiving her ''due'' upgrade is based on the [[wikipedia:Breda 30|Breda 30 light machine gun]], similar to how [[Saratoga]]'s seaplane launcher is based on the [[wikipedia:Thompson submachine gun|Thompson submachine gun]].
