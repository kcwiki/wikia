Admirals, thank you very much!
After the 5th Anniversary, multiple Kagerou-class Destroyers are scheduled to receive Kai Ni remodels, but before that!
We are currently under the preparation to release the Kai Ni Remodel of a certain Fleet-type Destroyer of the previous class.
Please look forward to this update as well!
