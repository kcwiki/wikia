===Strategy===
* Can use a maximum of 1 [[Land Base Aerial Support]] squadron. No abyssal air raid.
* '''You need at least 5 range to reach the boss''' with your [[Land Base Aerial Support]].
* The standard land base loadout is 3 land-based bombers + 1 fighter for maximum damage output on the boss node.
*Requires sinking the flagship at the boss node '''5 TIMES''' to deplete the gauge and clear the map.
*Maximum 2 [[BB]] and/or 2 [[CV]]/[[CVL]] allowed to sortie.
*The boss node has 3-5 [[Installation Type|land based]] targets, {{ShipLink|Isolated Island Princess}} and {{ShipLink|Supply Depot Princess}}, accompanied by 2-3 {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp}}s.
**WG42, Type 3 Shells and AP shells will help increase damage on these enemies.
*On the last kill boss and pre-boss nodes switches to stronger patterns as noted with <span style="color:red">'''(Final)'''</span> in the patterns table below.

===Possible Fleet Compositions===
*'''West Start'''
**Node D and F are [[Events#Air_Raid_Battle_.28.E7.A9.BA.E8.A5.B2.E6.88.A6.29|Air Defense nodes]].
**Node B, A and C are normal battle nodes.
**{{Event/Route|B|red|D|orange|C|red|F|orange|N|red}} '''(must be fast fleet)'''
***1CL'''(flagship)''' 1fBB(V) 3DD 1CAV
***1fBB(V) 4DD 1CL/CAV
***{{ShipLink|Nagato Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Mutsu Kai Ni}} and 4DDs
****1 DD can be replaced with CL, but that CL needs to be flagship
**{{Event/Route|A|red|D|orange|C|red|F|orange|N|red}} (Slow ships are allowed for this route)
***{{ShipLink|Akitsushima}} 1CA/CL 2DD 1CAV 1(F)BB(V)
***{{ShipLink|Akitsushima}}, {{ShipLink|Nagato Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Mutsu Kai Ni}}, CAV/CL 2DD

*'''East Start:'''
**Node I is an air defense node and doesn't eat much resources as cost.
**Having {{ShipLink|Akitsu Maru Kai}} will skip node I and go J-N.
**{{Event/Route|M|red|K|red|J|red|I|orange|N|red}}
***2CV(B) 1CA(V) 1CL 2DD
***1CV(B) 1(F)BB(V) 1CA(V) 1CL 2DD
**{{Event/Route|M|red|K|red|J|red|N|red}}
***{{ShipLink|Akitsu Maru Kai}} 1(F)BB(V)/CV(B) 1CA(V) 1CL 2DD

===LBAS Flight Range===
[[File:6-4 LBAS flight range.png|500px|center]]
====Node M Land-Based Aircraft Proficiency Leveling====
*If you wish to rank up your [[Aircraft Proficiency]] , you may utilize node M to do so.
*'''Your Land-Base' Range must be 8 or higher''' (Range is counted from the West starting point even if you started from the East)
**If you are trying to rank up aircraft with lower range, you may be required to bring a {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Large Flying Boat}} (3+ Range) or {{EquipmentLink|PBY-5A Catalina}} (2+ Range) to increase your Land-base's range. 
**Due to the maximum range increase being 3+, you will be unable to use this method to rank up any aircrafts with 4 or lower range even if you bring a Large Flying Boat or PBY-51 Catalina. 
*Sortie 1 Submarine with a variety of aircraft to rank up in your Land-Base. You will start from East.
*Send your Land-Base Aircraft Support to attack node M only twice. 
*This will result in a Rank D loss, but your aircraft will be ranked up from Blank to Double Chevron after around 12 runs.
**If you send 1 aircraft with Anti-Submarine Patrol capabilities, like {{EquipmentLink|Prototype Toukai}} , you can avoid the loss.
*You may ignore morale on both your submarine and aircraft all the way.
*1 or 2 aircraft may be shot down sometimes which will only cost around 3 fuel to 5 bauxite per plane.
