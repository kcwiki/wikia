The name of the state-of-the-art machine that was developed to be the successor of the "Zero" carrier-based fighter, is "Reppuu". This is the improved performance type, "Reppuu Kai".<br/>As a reciprocating carrier-based fighter, its latent combat capabilities have been raised to the apex, for Admirals' fleet air-defense and air-control. Recently, after several decades, there was news that the design documents were discovered!

The Mitsubishi A7M3-J ''Reppuu Kai ''(''Strong Gale, Modified'') is a proposed interceptor variant of the Mitsubishi {{EquipmentLink|Prototype Reppuu Late Model|text=A7M2 ''Reppuu''}} with an increased maximum speed of 648 km/h using a 2,200 hp forced-induction version of the Mitsubishi MK9 and an armament consisting of six 30 mm cannons. A working prototype was never produced, as the A7M2's design documents were lost in the bombing raids of March 1944.
