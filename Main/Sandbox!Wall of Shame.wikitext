;"Should I reset the gauge to farm for drops?"
:"Starting from this event, boss pattern will no longer stay in final form after clearing the event. Instead they will revert to original pattern, so there's no need to reset if you were just concerned about the pattern. However, because it is impossible to change the difficulty after clearing a map, if you wish to clear a map on a different difficulty from the difficulty you are farming in, it would be wise to constantly reset the gauge by changing the difficulty back and forth to avoid accidentally clearing a map at an unintended difficulty level."

;"Can I get all new ships, including the drop-only [[Roma]] and [[Takanami]] in all difficulties, including Easy?"
:"Yes. For further details about where you can obtain these drops, read the tables above. If you don't understand what those representations mean, then read the explanations under section heading. But do note that the drop rates in easier difficulties are likely to be lower than hard."

;"What is this [[File:tag.png|frameless]] that appears on my ships?"
:"They are tags that mark your girls if they sortied to certain event maps, and can no longer be sortied to other restricted maps on Medium or Hard."
:"In this event, blue text means the ship has been used in E-3, and can no longer be used on E-4 or E-5's medium or hard."
:"Green text means the ship has been used in E-4, and can no longer be used on E-3 or E-5's medium or hard."
:"Brown text means the ship has been used in E-5, and can no longer be used on E-3 or E-4's medium or hard."

;"My ships are these ships with these levels and I have these equipments, what difficulty should I choose?"
:"Compare rewards across difficulties, check what difficulty that ship you want will drop at by looking at tables above, check your resources and buckets count, read enemy formations at different difficulties and then make your choice. If you still can't decide, do a trial run on the highest difficulty and see if you can handle it. If not, then decrease the difficulty."

;Can the 2nd Flagship sink?
:No, they will '''not''' sink (''confirmed as of [[Summer 2016 Event]]'').
;What happens when I advance with a damaged ship?
:Ships will not sink as long they '''''are not'' heavily damaged (大破)''' when entering a new battle. A non-heavily damaged ship (including minor damage/小破, moderate damage/中破) will stay alive with 1HP even if she took excessive damage, and the rest of the damage taken will be shown as "Miss". <span style="color:red">'''If you continue the sortie (進撃)''' with a ship '''heavily damaged'''</span>{{Taiha}} and enter a new battle, <span style="color:red; font-size:18px;">''they are at risk of sinking and '''being lost forever'''!''</span>
;I notice there are heart-locks in the ship selection screen.
:Click that and the designated ship will not appear in the modernization material list, and grays out their scrapping option. Useful if you don't want to accidentally lose her.
;How can I prevent my ships from sinking?
:To avoid sinking your ship, make sure they are not '''heavily damaged (大破)''' before a battle. A ship will never sink if she enters the battle in good condition (no damage / minor damage [<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">小破] / </span>moderate damage [中破]).
:When ships in good condition receive excessive damage they will be left with 1 HP, which can be repaired to full health. If you choose to advance (進撃) with your ship heavily damaged, she may be sunk.
:If you''' accidentally chose to advance '''when you have heavily damaged ships, '''closing the game before you choose the formation''' for the battle will still retreat your fleet.
:Sunken ships are lost forever and not retrievable. If you need to risk your damaged ships to proceed to the next battle, make sure to equip some form of [[Tutorial:_FAQ#How_does_damage_control_work.3F|damage control]] equipment on them. It allows your ships to be revived if they are sunk by the enemy.
:Both night and day battle are considered the same battle, so '''ships which are brought to "heavy damage" during the same battle''' can enter night battle without the fear of being sunk.
:Video about ships which were heavily damaged during the day before proceeding to night battle: - http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm22148662 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CayD735o04
;How does damage control work?
:Ships equipped with {{Template:EmergencyRepair}}[[Equipment|Damage Control]] will be revived after sinking and become invulnerable throughout the battle. There are two types of damage controls:
:#Repair Team (応急修理要員):
:#*revives your ship to 20% of their max HP after being sunk.
:#*allows you to repair heavily damaged flagship to 50% of max HP before moving to next node.
:#*item is consumed upon activation.
:#Repair Goddess (応急修理女神):
:#*repairs your ship to full HP after being sunk.
:#*allows the option to repair heavily damaged flagship to 100% HP.
:#*fully resupplies the ship.
:#*item is consumed upon activation.
:Damage control equipment can be obtained through quests or through purchases from the cash shop.<br />One damage control item will be consumed immediately after the ship sinks, reviving and preventing your ship from sinking during that particular battle. If you advance to the next node (進撃) with the same ship heavily damaged again, you will need another damage control item for protection. If an additional damage control item is absent, the ship may sink.

;Can I go back and change the difficulty once I cleared the map?
Once the map is cleared (boss HP bar is depleted, boss is defeated, and the HP bar is no longer visible in the map):
* '''You CAN NO LONGER re-adjust the difficulty''', but can still farm the map on the difficulty you have chosen to clear the map with.
* The enemy patterns '''reverts''' back to pre-final patterns.
