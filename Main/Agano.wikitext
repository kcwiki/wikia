==Character==
===Appearance===

===Personality===
* Agano has an exuberant, teasing, and playful personality. She shows her emotions plainly, and frequently gets carried away in what she is doing to the point of forgetting the time, even when she's supposed to be the timekeeper. Like many lead ships of a class in KanColle, she seems to have a special relationship with the second ship in her class, in this case, Agano has several references in her speech in the game to a tendency to grope or otherwise harass her sister Noshiro.
*She, like many other ships, has a catchphrase; Agano's catchphrase is "Kirarin".

==Trivia==
*Sunk February 15, 1944.
