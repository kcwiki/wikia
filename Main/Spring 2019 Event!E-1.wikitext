==Before Starting the Event==
*If you wish to challenge any difficulty above Easy this event, it is highly advised for players to read up the [[Spring_2019_Event/Info|Info tab]] first to understand about difficulty selection and ship-locking. 

==Map Guide==
*This is a '''single fleet''' map.
*'''Carriers(CV/L/B), Battleships (F/BB/V) and LHA cannot enter this Map.'''
*The boss node {{Event/Route|W|Red}} must be unlocked before the HP gauge can be depleted.
*One [[Land Base Aerial Support]] squadron is available for sortie (see range below).

===Part 1: Unlocking the boss node W===
*To unlock the boss node, admirals must visit anchor nodes {{Event/Route|G|Green}} and {{Event/Route|U|Green}}, and also S? rank surface nodes {{Event/Route|O|Red}} and {{Event/Route|S|Red}}. The steps can be done in any order.
*'''NOTE:'''Those requirements have been tested for '''HARD MODE''', lower difficulties might not need to do all the steps listed in order to unlock the boss node.

===Part 2: Beat the boss===
*Fleets used to reach node {{Event/Route|O|Red}} during the first part can be sortied for the boss node {{Event/Route|W|Red}} after it unlocks.
**Route:{{Event/Route|D|Blue|H|Blue|I|Red|L|Blue|O|Red|W|Red}}
***1CL 5DD
***2CL 4DD
***1CL 1AV 4DD
***1CL 1CA(V) 4DD
****Will route to {{Event/Route|J|Red}} from {{Event/Route|I|Red}} (easy+ only)
***1CL 4DD 1DE
*There is a LoS check from {{Event/Route|O|Red}} to {{Event/Route|W|Red}}.
*'''50+''' {{LOS}} using the [[Line_of_Sight#Equipment_LoS_weighting_modifier|F33(C<sub>n</sub>=3)]] formula is required in order to safely pass.
*The fleet must also be equipped with at least 3 surface radars '''(medium+)''' to be able to reach the boss node.
*The boss node is a surface fleet with {{ShipLink|Light Cruiser Tsu-Class Flagship|text=Light Cruiser Tsu-Class}} as the flagship.
**It is recommended to equip your fleet with [[Combat/Equipment Guide|Double Attack]] setups.
**To clear the map, the flagship must be '''SUNK''' during the '''Last Dance'''.
*The Vanguard formation can be used on preboss nodes to increase survivability, however it is not recommended at the boss node as it is exclusively a defensive formation.
*'''LBAS''': Sending a squadron to the boss node can help (4 bombers with range 5+), however keep in mind that there is heavy enemy Anti-Air that can make the high bauxite loss coming with each run not worth it.
**Using [[Expedition/Support Expedition|boss support expedition]] instead is recommended if you have difficulties clearing the enemies at the boss (You can also use both LBAS and support, I'm not stopping you).
