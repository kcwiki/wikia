|en = As they have become somewhat obsolete, the surplus 12.7cm Twin Mount Type B turrets have undergone a thorough modernization. One of wartime modifications in this models is the implementation of dual-purpose guns. Improved maximum elevation, new loading mechanism and coupling with an anti-aircraft fire director are just a few of multiple improvements aimed at coping with reality of anti-aircraft warfare. All these refinements resulted in a destroyer gun turret which is entirely different from the conventional Type B model. Refurbishments aimed at the use by the successors of the Special Type mod. II destroyers like Hatsuharu and Shiratsuyu classes, allow an effective use as anti-aircraft armament thanks to the implementation of the dual-purpose guns.
