The 634th Air Group was sort of carrier aircraft division, which belonged to aircraft-carrying battleship Ise and Hyuga (they were to carry 14 and 8 Zuiun's respectively) in the latter half of war in Pacific. The air group was initially trained to catapulted off their battleships, but later transferred to ground bases in the Philippines, Taiwan, as well as Mainland Japan after October 1944, thus never saw action they initially intended. 634th Air Group's mission was dive-bombing and strafing toward American vessels during nighttime, and they kept themselves clear of so-called Kamikaze suicidal attack until the very end of war (hence the higher stats, reflecting the Air Group's high skill level).
