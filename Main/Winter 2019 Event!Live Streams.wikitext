|Aiming to Stream Day 1, and whenever is convenient. Definitely at best, Normal Mode. Depending on reward, maybe Hard. Stream will be a more casual/interactive type. Will contain lots of salt during the stream.

|Hard Mode Frontline Live Stream on Day 1. Start Time may have delays due to Wikia and Information Publications taking priority, and is subject to a more later time if work comes up.

|"It may not be at my best also I'm not confident to do Hard mode in all maps, but I will try to clear this event and not letting my ships sunk not one of them. Grab your popcorn with salt flavor cuz it's about to get salty... "
