===Seasonal Quotes===
{{ShipSeasonalQuotes}}

== Character ==
===Appearance===
* Visually, she has shoulder length asymmetrical blue hair along with blue eyes. She wears a dark blue serafuku, consisting of a blue blouse, blue shorts with frills, kneehighs and a blue necktie (always tied improperly) with the Mutsuki-class' signature crescent moon-shaped trinket attached to it. Her flower is a morning glory. She has a "cutesy fang".

=== Personality ===
* Minazuki has a cheerful, yet somewhat soft-spoken, and highly feminine personality. Her official lines have her as acting somewhat dependent upon her older sister Satsuki, or "Sacchin", and that she's also close to "Fumi-chan", both of which, along with Nagatsuki, were part of DesDiv 22 with the historical <em>Minazuki</em>.

==Trivia==
* Sunk via torpedoes from submarine USS Harder off Tawitawi, south of Sibutu Island, Philippines 04°05′N 119°30′E, near the [[wikipedia:Exclusive Economic Zone|EEZ]] border of Indonesia. The destroyer Wakatsuki rescued 45 survivors, but Minazuki's captain, Lieutenant Kieji Isobe, was not among them. The ship was struck from the Navy List on 10 August 1944.
* Minazuki means the 6th month of the year. If it is translated directly it would mean the month without water (水＝water, 無=nothing, 月=month). However, this is not the case as in this case the '無' just becomes ’の’ (belonging to, of) a connecting word making Minazuki the month of water.
* The flower in her armament is a morning glory with a flower meaning of 'unrequited love', 'strong bonds' and 'love'
