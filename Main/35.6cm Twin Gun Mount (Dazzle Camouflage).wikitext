The final version of Kongou-class fast battleship Haruna's primary battery. It has been made in the Dazzle camouflage of zebra-pattern vertical-stripes, though the pattern has questionable efficacy. Loaded with the Type 3 shell and facing the sky against enemy aircraft, it worked to defend the remaining fleet moored within Kure Naval Base.
