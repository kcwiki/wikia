{{Equipment

|en = A dual-purpose gun developed and deployed by the United States combined with a fire-control radar that is capable of surface and anti-air combat. It is a powerful anti-aircraft weapon. This equipment is a concentrated deployment of the twin-mounted 5inch guns that adopted a new type of ammunition to improve fire rate. Combining it with a fire-control radar has further increased its fleet air defense capabilities. It was equipped on the Atlanta-class cruisers and was used in the opening brawl of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.
