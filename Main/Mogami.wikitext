{{ShipQuotes
|Introduction = ボクが最上さ。大丈夫、今度は衝突しないって。ホントだよ。
|Introduction/En = I'm Mogami. It's alright, I won't collide with anyone this time. Really!
|Introduction/Note = While part of Cruiser Division 7 and en-route to Midway, a US ship spotted the group and the command was given to make a 45° turn to avoid possible torpedoes. The third ship in the line, Mikuma, in front of Mogami, accidentally made a 90° turn. This resulted in a collision which left Mogami heavily damaged. A year later, she collided with a oil tanker in Tokyo Bay. Nachi's collision with her ultimately caused her sinking.

|Introduction/Kai = 提督、また会ったね、最上だよ。僕の飛行甲板どう？似合ってる？
|Introduction/Kai/En = We meet again, Admiral. It's Mogami. How's my flight deck? Does it suit me?

== Character ==

=== Personality ===
* Mogami is a frank, upbeat, energetic, and tomboyish girl. Due to having collided three times in her historic service, she's also commonly portrayed as quite clumsy, and too eager to watch where's she's going. Although all three collisions were with three different ships, collisions with Mikuma are most commonly portrayed, as she is a sister-ship, and artists tend to keep sisters in their own cliques. Because of her short hair, boyish tone and the fact she wears shorts, she is often portrayed as the target of rumors of being a boy, or outright portrayed as one.
** Like [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Shigure Shigure], Mogami also uses "boku" (僕) to address herself, although not as soft and demure as the former. The usage of "boku" among Japanese girls is very rare.

==Trivia==
*Named after the [[wikipedia:Mogami_River|Mogami River]]. She refers to Basho's famous Haiku relevant to Mogami River (Samidare wo...).
**That name was first carried by the second protected cruiser of the Yodo class in 1908.
**Isuzu-class destroyer escort JDS Mogami has been commissioned to Japan's Maritime Self Defense Force, from 1961-1991.
*The Mogami class was an attempt to cheat with the Washington Naval Treaty's limits. She had all the characteristics defining a heavy cruiser (she was, after all, a development of the Myoukou class), but was mounted with 5*3 155mm turrets, which officially made her a light cruiser because of the low caliber of her main armament.
**As soon as the war began, she was quickly refitted with the usual 5*2 203mm.
*During the [http://www.microworks.net/pacific/battles/sunda_strait.htm Battle of Sunda Strait], Mogami launched six torpedos at [[Houston]]. Not only did all of them miss, she ended up hitting and sinking five of the ships that the Japanese fleet was defending, among which was [[Shinshuu Maru]].
*Scuttled 25 October 1944 after [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#The_Battle_of_Surigao_Strait_.2825_October.29|Battle of Surigao Strait]] at [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Mogami_%281934%29&params=09_40_N_124_50_E_ 09°40′N 124°50′E].
**Targeted for a future exploration by RV Petrel, under Paul Allen's funding when they discovered the entirety of the Nishimura Fleet in Surigao in 2018. They eventually discovered her wreckage on 8 May 2019 upon their return to the Philippines.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/rvpetrel/posts/2578429078859224</ref>
**She returns in the JMSDF as the newly-christened FFM-1 JS Mogami.
