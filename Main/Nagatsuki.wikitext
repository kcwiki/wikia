==Character==

===Appearance===
*Nagatsuki wears a black serafuku with a white tie, a black dress and black stockings. She has green hair with the Mutsuki-class' distinctive crescent moon-shaped hairpin keeping it in place.

===Personality===
*Speaks informally when compared to most of the other Mutsuki-class destroyers, but knows when to be serious when required.

==Trivia==
*Combat loss July 7, 1943 at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kula_Gulf Battle of Kula Gulf] ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Nagatsuki&params=08_02_S_157_12_E_ 08°02′S 157°12′E]).
*Her name is an archaic word for "September".
**It was first carried by the twenty-eighth ship of the first Kamikaze class in 1907.
*Her high luck (highest of the Mutsuki class) is most likely due to her not having been sunk: she was heavily damaged, but managed to beach herself to avoid sinking. However, it proved impossible to repair the damage and she was later destroyed by enemy aircraft.

== Quests ==
* Required by Quests [[Quests#A49|A49]] and [[Quests#B39|B39]].
