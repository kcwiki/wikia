===Recommended Fleet===
* 1 AV 2 CVL 2 DE 1 CL
**Routes: {{Event/Route|C|blue|E|red|F|green|H|blue|K|red}}
* 1 AV 2 DD 1 CL(T) 2 CA(V) ('''All Fast''')
**Routes: {{Event/Route|C|blue|E|red|K|red}}
**Using CL will guarantee {{Event/Route|E|red|K|red}}, while using CLT can route you {{Event/Route|F|green|H|blue|K|red}} instead. Nevertheless, both choices will avoid node G which has [[Battleship Ru-Class]]
**You can replace the AV with an AS if you are using a CL.

===Enemy Transport Ships Farming===
*Bringing at least 3 CV(L) guarantees routing towards Node B which contains a light Enemy Fleet including two Enemy {{ShipLink|Transport Ship Wa-Class|text=Transport}} Ships. This gives the player an easy way to clear the Transport Daily/Weekly Quests [[Quests#Bd5|Bd5]], [[Quests#Bd6|Bd6]], [[Quests#Bw3|Bw3]], and [[Quests#Bw4|Bw4]].
**Bringing an additional SS along prevents 4/6 ships from attacking you during shelling phase.
**Bringing additional DD/CLs carrying {{EquipmentLink|

Daihatsu Landing Craft|text=Daihatsu}} can increase the amount of bauxite obtained albeit minuscule.
