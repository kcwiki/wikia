主力艦隊を作戦海域へ投入、また、作戦を支援する前線へ基地航空隊を展開！敵艦隊を迎撃する。捷一号作戦発動！

Move the main fleet to the operation zone, and establish LBAS at the frontline to support the operation! We will intercept the enemy fleet. Commence Operation Sho-go!

*Phase 3: Defeat the [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] by destroying her HP Gauge Bar.
**Carrier Task Force must be used.
*'''LBAS''': 2 [[Land Base Aerial Support|Land Base Aerial Supports]] are available to sortie in this map.
**4+ range is required to reach the first boss node G.
**2+ range is required to reach the second boss node J.
**6+ range is required to reach the third boss node S.

{{clear}}

==Part 1: Defeating the Air Defense Princess==
*You must use Surface Task Force Combined Fleet.
*You have two options you may take for this Part
===Shortest Route===
*Route: A - B - C - F - G
*Requires for you to have 0 CV(L) in the main fleet.
** You can still bring 1 Fast CVL in the escort fleet and equip her with {{EquipmentLink|Night Operation Aviation Personnel}} to enable participation in night battle.
** Equipping Seaplane Fighters are recommended to achieve Air Parity or higher at the boss node, especially at higher difficulties.
*Requires you to have a Fast Fleet, and only 1 Battleship.
*Fleet Used: 1 FBB 4 CA(V) 1 CL/DD + 1 CL 2 DD 1 CA/CVL 2 CLT
**A compromise between route and firepower/survivability, as the CLTs could deliver preemptive strikes to enemy surface vessels; while reducing the risk of having your DDs crippled in 2nd fleet.

===Longest Route===
*Route: A - B - C - D - E - F - G
*Player is free to compose any kind of Fleet they want through Surface Task Force, including slow ships.
**Recommended Fleet is 4 BB(V) 2 CVL + 1 CL 2 DD 3 CLTs
*This route will consist of 2 Submarine nodes, 2 Air Raid nodes, and 2 Normal Battles.
**It is recommended that you bring at least 2 OASW capable DD/CL (ex. {{ShipLink|Isuzu/Kai Ni}}, {{ShipLink|Asashio/Kai Ni D}}) for the Submarine nodes.
*Although it a much longer route (with two Submarine nodes), it allows the player to establish a fleet with greater firepower which can reach and take down the boss reliably as long as the ASW is properly addressed.

==Part 2: Transport Operation==
*You must fully clear the TP Gauge Bar of this Part.
*You must use Transport Escort Combined Fleet.
*Just like any other Transport Operations, you must obtain at least a minimum of A-Rank Victory to deplete the TP Gauge Bar.
*It is recommended for you to bring some OASW-capable DD/CL, especially if you are doing Medium/Hard
*During this Phase, your [[Land Base Aerial Support]] will be attacked by Enemy Air Raids.
**'''DOES NOT''' occur in Easy mode.
**For Hard mode, the Player is required to have their LBAS fulfill a 0 Damage Defense against the Enemy Air Raid at least once in order to open up the Part 3.
***For this requirement, you are recommended to have your LBAS setup with 4 of your best [[List of Interceptor Fighters by stats|Interceptors]] and/or [[List of Fighters by stats|Fighters]] on both LBAS and set them to Air Defense.
***This [[User_blog:Setakat/Interceptor_Fighter_Effectiveness_Reference|guide]] lists out the effective fighter power for all interceptors and fighters in LBAS.
***Since the enemy Air power is too high to score Air Supremacy, multiple sorties may be required to score a 0 Damage Defense.
*You may wish to use Support Expedition for Pre-Boss nodes as it has many enemies who can potentially hit your ship(s) down to Heavy Damage with ease, especially so in Medium and Hard mode.

==Part 3: Defeat the Aircraft Carrier Princess==
*You must completely defeat the [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] by destroying her Boss HP Gauge Bar.
*You are required to use Carrier Task Force
*You require a certain number of Ships from the Historical Ozawa Fleet as listed above
**Requires at least 3/4/6 members minimum for Easy/Medium/Hard mode.
*Hard mode requires a very high Fleet Air Power. At least 570~600 for Pre-Final and 700~720 for Final Kill.
*To take the P - R route, you must only have a maximum of 3 CV(L/B)+ (F)BB(V) in the fleet.
**If you bring 4 CV(L) in the fleet, you will be taken to P - Q routing, but as Node Q is a Minor Air Raid node, you may wish to just take this extra node to bring more heavy ships.
*Historical Route: O-M-P-R-S
**1CV(B) 2CVL 3XX (XX cannot be (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B)) + 1CL 2DD 3XX (XX ships of your choice)
***Must be fast fleet
*Historical Route: O-M-P-Q-R-S
**1CVB 2CVL 1CV 1(F)BB(V) 1XX (XX cannot be (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B)) + 1CL 2DD 3XX (XX are ships of your choice)
**2CVB 1-2CVL 0-1CV 1(F)BB(V) 1XX (XX cannot be (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B)) + 1CL 2DD 3XX (XX cannot be FBB) (XX are ships of your choice)
**1CV 3CVL 1(F)BB(V) 1XX (XX cannot (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B)) + 1CL 2DD 3XX (XX are ships of your choice)
