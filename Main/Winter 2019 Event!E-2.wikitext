{{:Winter 2019 Event/E-2/Historical Ship Bonus}}

===Map Guide===
*This is a 2 phases map with 2 ship-locks:
** <span style="color:green;">'''GREEN'''</span> for ships starting from the '''first''' starting point.
** <span style="color:blue;">'''BLUE'''</span> for ships starting from the '''second''' starting point.
**<span style="color:red;">'''WARNING:'''</span> For '''Medium/Hard''' Difficulty, you cannot mix ships of the two tags.
*You are given two [[Land Base Aerial Support]].
*'''Standard and Armored Carriers (CV/B) cannot enter this Map.'''
**CVLs however are allowed to be used.

{{clear}}

===Part 1 : Defeating {{ShipLink|Heavy Cruiser Princess|text=Node K Boss}}===
*<span style="color:red;">'''Mandatory:'''</span> : You must meet all of the requirements to go down to the Boss:
**Amount of ships with {{EquipmentLink|Type 22 Surface Radar|Type 33 Surface Radar|Type 22 Surface Radar Kai 4|text=Surface Radars}} equipped ≥ ?/?/3/4 on Casual/Easy/Medium/Hard
**At least 2 Destroyers in the Fleet.
*It is recommended that you utilize the Vanguard Formation as much as possible to pass the Pre-Boss nodes smoothly.
*Air raids against your Land Base can occur (starting even at Casual difficulty).

{{:Winter 2019 Event/Info/Surface Radar}}

You may choose to take one of two following routes:
====North Route====
*Route: {{Event/Route|D|red|F|red|G|lightblue|J|red|K|red}}
**Fleet: 2 CA 1 CAV 1 CL 2 DD
***This route is the shortest route towards the Boss Node {{Event/Route|K|red}}.
***Due to lack of a BB however, you may have some trouble finishing off the Boss.

====South Route====
*Route: {{Event/Route|A|red|B|red|F|red|G|lightblue|J|red|K|red}}
**Fleet: 2 BB 1 CVL 2 DD 1 CA(V)/CL
***This Route takes a slightly longer route in contrast to the Northern Route, however it will reach the boss node without any ammo penality.
***It is highly recommended to bring AACI for node {{Event/Route|A|red}}.

===Part 2 : Opening the #2 Start Point===
[[File:【KanColle】 Winter 2019 Event E-2 Unlock Start Point 2|right|250 px]]
*To open up the hidden 2nd Start Point, you must do the following (in any order, and can be done separately):
**Obtain Air Superiority (<span style="color:green">'''航空優勢! '''</span>) or Higher on Air Raid Nodes:
***HARD - {{Event/Route|A|red|L|red|N|red}}
***MEDIUM - {{Event/Route|A|red|L|red}}
***EASY/CASUAL - {{Event/Route|A|red}}
***<span style="color:red;">'''WARNING'''</span> : Please be advised that you '''must''' send [[Land Base Aerial Support]] to the Nodes even if you can already obtain Air Superiority without them, otherwise it will not count!
***The Air Superiority (<span style="color:green">'''航空優勢! '''</span>) requirement at Node {{Event/Route|A|red}}  must be done '''after''' you defeated the Node K Boss.
****You are advised to send your LBAS equipped with the appropriate {{Fighter}} Carrier-Based Fighters or {{Interceptor Fighter 2}} Land-Based Fighters down to the Nodes (Please see below for the LBAS Range Map).
**Obtain Air Superiority (<span style="color:green">'''航空優勢! '''</span>) or Higher from against an Enemy Air Raid on your LBAS via (防空) <span style="color:Orange">'''Air Defense mode'''</span>. '''(Not Required for Casual Difficulty)'''
*Once you finish the requirement above, the 2nd Start Point will open up along with the Route to the 2nd Boss.

====Recommendations on reaching Node {{Event/Route|N|red}}====
*If using a regular fleet, you are recommended to use 2 BB 1 CVL 1 CA(V) 2 DD and take the South Route.
**Use of Vanguard Formation is very important to survive Nodes {{Event/Route|I|red}} and {{Event/Route|M|red}}
**Another option is to just go Line Ahead in both nodes {{Event/Route|I|red}} and {{Event/Route|M|red}}, bring Pre-Boss Support Expedition, and if necessary, use 1 LBAS (2 waves) filled with {{Land-based Attack Aircraft}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 1 Land-based Attack Aircraft|text=Land-based Attack Aircrafts}} to attack Node {{Event/Route|M|red}}.
*Another option is to use a Submarine Fleet filled with {{ShipLink|I-58|I-19|I-8|I-401|I-400|I-26|text=SSVs}}, bring {{Seaplane Fighter}} Seaplane Fighters as much as possible, and send both LBAS down with your Best Fighters to Node {{Event/Route|N|red}}.
**Please note this method is not valid for anyone with low number of Seaplane Fighters.

===Part 3: Defeating the Node P Final Boss===
*The Recommended Route is : {{Event/Route|Q|red|I|red|L|red|M|red|N|red|P|red}}
**Fleet: 2 (F)BB 4 CA(V) + 1 CL 2 DD 3 XX (from CLT/CA(V)/DD)
**You must also meet all of the following requirements:
***Amount of ships with Surface Radars equipped ≥ ?/?/7 on Casual/Easy/Medium+
***'''NO CVL'''
**The Boss is an outdated Enemy Boss Ship {{ShipLink|Southern Demon}}, who has relatively low stats.
***However her Escort Ships can be troublesome, where use of [[Land Base Aerial Support]] against the Node and Support Expedition is highly recommended.


====Recommendations====
*Because you cannot bring any CVL in this route, it is important that you bring approximately 5 or more {{Seaplane Fighter}} {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai|text=Seaplane Fighter}} in order to gain Air Superiority at the Boss Node '''(Only as long as you bring Fighters into the Boss node via LBAS)'''.
**<span style="color:red;">'''NOTE'''</span> : Seaplane Bombers such as [[Zuiun]] '''IS NOT''' a Seaplane Fighter! Please do not confuse the two.
**If you think you cannot survive this route due to lack of CVL, you are by all means free to use 2 CVL in Surface Task Force, at the cost of going into a much harsher route {{Event/Route|R|red|T|red|U|red|L|red|M|red|N|red|P|red}}.
***Please be aware that Node {{Event/Route|R|red}} and {{Event/Route|T|red}} have very heavy Enemy Carrier presence, with very high Air Power requirement as well '''(Not really for Casual/Easy difficulties)'''
***Please be aware that Node {{Event/Route|U|red}} has {{ShipLink|Battleship Re-Class|Battleship Re-Class Elite||text=Battleship Re-Class}} waiting for you.
****However, up to Medium-scale, the Re-class is only a Standard version and isn't really much of a huge threat overall.
*Use of {{ShipLink|Nagato/Kai Ni}} and a 2nd BB for the utilization of her Special Attack either on Node {{Event/Route|M|red}} which has two {{ShipLink|Battleship Princess}}, or on the Boss Node itself is highly recommended.
**If you have obtained {{ShipLink|Nelson}} during the [[Early Fall 2018 Event]], use of Nelson Touch is also an option as well.

===Optional : Opening Shortcuts===
*Although optional, you are eligible to open up shortcuts from Nodes {{Event/Route|U|red}} to {{Event/Route|M|red}}, and {{Event/Route|M|red}} to {{Event/Route|P|red}}.

====Opening U to M Shortcut====
*Please do the following in any order, and can all be done separately:
**Obtain Air Supremacy ( <span style="color:green">'''制空権確保! '''</span>) in the Air Raid Nodes {{Event/Route|R|red|V|red}}.
***<span style="color:red;">'''WARNING'''</span> : Please be advised that you must send down [[Land Base Aerial Support]] down to the Nodes to gain Air Superiority. Otherwise it will not count!
**Obtain No Damage (Perfect LBAS Defense) from against an Enemy Air Raid.
***'''HARD MODE ONLY:''' obtain Air Supremacy ( <span style="color:green">'''制空権確保! '''</span>) as well during the perfect defense.
**Obtain S-Rank Victory in {{Event/Route|W|red}} Two '''(2)''' Times.

====Opening M to P Shortcut====
<span style="color:red;">'''NOTE'''</span> : You must have had opened U to M shortcut first!
*Please do the following requirements to open the M to P shortcut:
**Obtain Air Supremacy  (<span style="color:green">''' 制空権確保! '''</span>) from against an Enemy Air Raid on your LBAS by defending it with LBAS Air Defense.
**Obtain Air Supremacy (<span style="color:green">''' 制空権確保! '''</span>) in the Air Raid Nodes{{Event/Route|A|red|L|red|R|red}}.
**Obtain Air Superiority (<span style="color:green">''' 航空優勢! '''</span>) in the Air Raid Node {{Event/Route|N|red}}.
***<span style="color:red;">'''WARNING'''</span> : Please be advised that you must send down [[Land Base Aerial Support]] down to the Nodes to gain Air Superiority/Supremacy. Otherwise it will not count!
**Obtain S-Rank Victory in {{Event/Route|K|red}} One '''(1)''' Time.
