'''''General tip:''''' an easy way to get equipment in the early game is to take off the stock equipment from ships you are about to use for modernization. The lack of the equipment doesn't have any effect on the stats gained from modernization, but when you modernize and the ship used for modernization is still equipped with its equipment, the equipment will be lost!
