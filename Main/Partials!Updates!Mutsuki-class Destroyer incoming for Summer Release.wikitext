|JP01 = 約90年前の本日7月12日は、旧式ながら前線で頑張った睦月型駆逐艦「三日月」が進水した日です。現在「艦これ」運営鎮守府では、同じく睦月型駆逐艦で、やはり前線で奮闘を続けたある姉妹艦の改二改装準備を今夏の実装を目指して進めています。睦月型提督の皆さん、少しだけお楽しみに！
|EN01 = 90 Years ago on this date on July 12th, it was the day that the Mutsuki-class Destroyer Mikazuki had first launched.
Currently KanColle Development Team is preparing for the release of a Kai Ni remodel for a Mutsuki-class Destroyer who had continously fought in the frontlines despite being an old model. It is scheduled to be released this Summer.
Admirals of the Mutsuki-class Destroyers, please look forward to it!
