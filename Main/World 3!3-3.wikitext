**1 CL 1 CLT/CA(V) 4 DD
***Cheapest composition, going south route to avoid enemy BB CV pre-boss, but might have difficulty winning the boss fight
*{{Event/Route|A|red|B|red|F|purple|J|blue|K|red|M|red}}
**1 (F)BB(V)/CVL 2 CA(V)/CLT 1 CL 2 DD
***Stronger composition for south route, but will cost more fuel and ammo along with possible buckets due to the number of encounters you'll face

==Furniture Coin Box Collecting==
It's possible to collect Furniture Coins in the south route with the fleet '''3 CVL 2 DD 1 CA(V)/CLT''' going either {{Event/Route|A|red|B|red|D|green}} or {{Event/Route|A|red|B|red|F|purple|H|green}}
*However, there is a chance you'll avoid both nodes
