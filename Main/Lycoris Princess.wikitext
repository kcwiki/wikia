==Trivia==
*[[Spring 2016 Event]] E-5 Boss.
*'''Lycoris''' is a Greek word, which means "Twilight". It is also the name of a flower, known in English as "Hurricane Lillies"　and "Higan-bana" in Japanese, which is usually associated with Japanese and Chinese legends and superstitions regarding Death and the afterlife. The headgear worn by Lycoris Princess resembles the flower in question.
**For the flower, some legends have it that when a person sees someone that they may never meet again, these flowers would bloom along the path. Perhaps because of these sorrowful legends, Japanese people often used these flowers in funerals. Popular name {{nihongo|''Higanbana''|彼岸花|Higan-bana}} of Japanese for lycoris is literally ''higan'' (''the other side'', specifically ''that shore of the [[:wikipedia:Sanzu River|Sanzu River]]''); flower means decorate and enjoyable , flower of afterlife in {{nihongo|''gokuraku jōdo''|[[:wikipedia:ja:極楽浄土|極楽浄土]]|gokuraku jōdo}}, also known as the Western Paradise, or the Pure Land.
*In [[Fall 2013 Event]] (The Iron Bottom Sound Event), E4 boss node were named as Lycoris Air Base. And this is probably where her name come from.
*She represents the Henderson Airfield in 1943, which is the one fully [[wikipedia::File:Henderson Field - Guadalcanal - 11 April 1943.jpg|rebuilt by the American forces]], whereas [[Airfield Princess]] represents the 1942 airfield which was bombarded by [[Kongou]] and [[Haruna]] during [[wikipedia:Guadalcanal Campaign|Operation Watchtower]] (i.e. [[Fall 2013 Event]] and [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s E-4)
