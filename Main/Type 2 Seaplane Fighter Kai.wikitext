This is a seaplane fighter rush developed and put into service using the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter as a base, meant as a stopgap until new model seaplane fighters can be put into service. It's not an aircraft that was designed with shipborne operations via catapult in mind, but its body and float strength were improved for this use.

|notes =
*Can be upgraded from [[Type 0 Reconnaissance Seaplane]] using [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]].
*Quest [[Quests#B88|B88]] offers this as a choice between two rewards, the other being the [[PBY-5A Catalina]].
