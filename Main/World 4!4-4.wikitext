===Tips===
* You must sink the flagship of the boss fleet '''FOUR''' times before the map is cleared.
** [[Light Carrier Nu-Class]] Flagship can replace [[Armored Carrier Princess]] and become the boss instead.
** One of the boss node's compositions has a submarine present that can render your CVL/CL/DD useless if not dealt using ASW gears.
* 90 air power provides at least Air Superiority for every route towards the boss node.
**At least 160 air power is required for Air Supremacy.
* This map is more consistent for completing the [[Quests#Bw6|World 4 Weekly Quest]] compared to 4-2, but is not as reliable if you need to destroy transports as well.
===Fleet Compositions===
* The middle route ({{Event/Route|A|red|E|red|I|red|K|red}}) is the shortest and easiest route towards the boss node. Possible compositions are as followed:
** 0-1 (F)BB(V) 2 CV(B) 1-2 CL/CA(V) 2 DD
** 2 CV(B) 1 CVL 1 CA(V)/CL 2 DD
**  3 CVL 1 CL 2 DD
