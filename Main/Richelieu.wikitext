|Introduction =Je suis vraiment ravie de vous rencontrer, Amiral. お会いできて嬉しいです、Amiral。戦艦Richelieu、参ります。 
|Introduction/En = I'm really delighted to meet you, Admiral. Battleship Richelieu, heading forth.
|Introduction/Note = Her first sentence is the same as the second one, but in French ("Je suis vraiment ravie de vous rencontrer, Amiral").

|Introduction/Kai = Salut mon amiral. 戦艦Richelieu、今日も付き合ってあげる。いいでしょう？
|Introduction/Kai/En =Hi, my Admiral. Battleship Richelieu. I'll be accompanying you again today. It's fine, right? 
|Introduction/Kai/Note = She's a lot less formal with the Admiral in her Kai introduction

|Library =Richelieu級戦艦一番艦、Richelieuよ。
自由・平等・博愛の国で生まれた最強の戦艦といったほうが話が早いかしら？
特にこの四連装主砲は流石…といったところね。
そうね、あの戦いは両陣営でも戦ったわ。まあ、色々あるの。C’est comme ça. 
|Library/En = I'm Richelieu, first ship of the Richelieu-Class battleships. Maybe it would be faster to say that I was the strongest battleship to be ever born in the country of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity? That's a given, especially considering those quadruple turrets... That's right, I fought on both sides during that war. Well, a lot of things happened. That's how it is.
|Library/Note = She uses "C'est comme ça" ("That's how it is") the same way Teste uses "C'est la vie".

|Idle/Note = Quadruple turret, while bringing incredibly powerful shelling potential, is very hard to maintain and preserve, due to the increasing of armor and size to house four cannons and the powerful recoil force if firing all cannons at once.

|Secretary Married =どうしたの？落ち込んでいる様ね。Richelieuに話してみなさい。そんなこと、いいのよ気にしないで。Mon amiral貴方はドンと構えいていればいいのよ。C'est comme ça.

|Supply/En = Thank you! ... Oh my, just this much?

|Docking Minor =ごめんなさい　お風呂を頂くわ。Désolé 
|Docking Minor/En = Sorry, I'll take a bath.

==Character==
===Appearance===
Richelieu has pale skin, very long, light blonde wavy hair and swept bangs along with a small lock of hair hanging between her eyes. Her eyes are (supposed to be) light grey and sometimes have a hint of green. Richelieu also has two moles on her face, located under her left eye and under her lips.

Her costume includes a large, loose white beret with a red pom-pom accesory on top and a long black ribbon attached to the back, a red-grey-black square-motif scarf that reaches her feet, a one-piece black-white-grey dress, a large white belt secured just under her breasts, black-white gloves, a tricolore scarf tied onto her left arm, black-white stockings, and loafers with gold anchor accesories on top.

Her appearance bears a strong resemblance to fellow French ship, Commandant Teste due to her hair and wearing a French Navy beret.

===Personality===
==Notes==
==Trivia==
* Her main gun batteries are all concentrated at the bow (front of the ship) and none at the aft, like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_battleship_Dunkerque French Battleship Dunkerque].
* Launched in 1939, Richelieu is the nameship of her class, which were the largest battleships ever built by France.
* Commissioned too late to see service in the early stage of the war, she first saw combat against her former allies when Swordfish bombers from HMS Hermes attacked her on July 7th 1940, in which one torpedo struck and detonated her depth charges causing significant damage. She was repaired enough in time to move to Dakar, which she helped defend against British forces, though she was hit twice. After the remaining French forces returned to the Allies side she went to America for refit and repair. Upon return she saw service with the British Home Fleet before moving to the British Eastern Fleet to take part in operations against Japan, seeing some bombardment duties. On her way to Singapore, she struck a magnetic mine at 0744 on 9 September while passing down the Straits of Malacca. She eventually limped into Singapore at 12:00 on 11 September.
* She remained in service until 1968, when she was broken up for scrap. A gun barrel is preserved at Brest.
