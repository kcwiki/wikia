*Was the Flagship of the ABDA fleet, under Rear-Admiral Doorman.
*Sunk by a single torpedo from [[Haguro]] during the [[wikipedia:Battle of the Java Sea|Battle of the Java Sea]] on 28 February 1942, which cut all power making saving her impossible. Doorman ordered the rest of the fleet to leave and save themselves, going down with the ship.
*The wreck of ''De Ruyter'' was discovered by specialist wreck divers on 1 December 2002 and declared a war grave. 
**However in 2016 the wreck of ''De Ruyter'' had disappeared from the seabed, due to illegal salvage.
