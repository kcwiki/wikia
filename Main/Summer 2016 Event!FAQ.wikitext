=== Can the 2nd Flagship sink? ===

No, they will '''not''' sink (''confirmed as of [[Summer 2016 Event]]'').

=== Is it possible to complete a map with TP gauge on easy for most of it and then revert back to hard for final kill? ===

No, it works '''exactly''' the same way as the HP gauge. If you change the difficulty after damaging the TP gauge, the TP gauge '''will''' be reset to max and you will lose all progress on that map.

<div style = "text-align:right">[[#top|back to top]]</div>

=== Will I be able to get duplicates of [[Prinz Eugen]], [[Graf Zeppelin]], [[Akitsushima]], [[Akizuki]], etc? ===

Yes, the only exception is [[Graf Zeppelin]]. [[Graf Zeppelin]] has been confirmed by the developers themselves to be unobtainable if you already have one in possession <ref group=FAQ name=Graf />. According to reports, they still can drop if you get rid of the one you have in possession <ref group=FAQ name=Graf1 />, <ref group=FAQ name=Graf2 />.
As of [[Summer 2016 Event]], you can now get multiple [[Prinz Eugen]].

=== What ships would be required for ship-specific routing, or being extremely helpful, in different maps? ===
Seven of the following are required for E-3 routing:
*Kongou, Haruna
*Choukai
*Mogami, Mikuma, Suzuya, Kumano
*Kinu, Yura
*Fubuki, Shirayuki, Hatsuyuki

=== Which event-only ships can we get in this event? ===

:See the table below for previous event only specific drops.

<div style = "text-align:right">[[#top|back to top]]</div>

=== Is there any [[Events/Mechanics#Ship_Locking|ship locking]]? ===
Yes for normal and hard.<br>
You may wish to refer to [http://kancolle.doorblog.jp/archives/49296732.html this link (Japanese only)] - a tentative thread about how to get the best out of ship locking.

<div style = "text-align:right">[[#top|back to top]]</div>

=== Any [[Events/Mechanics#Map-specific_Mechanics|armor breaking debuff mechanisms]]? ===
[[Summer 2016 Event/E-3|E-3]] and [[Summer 2016 Event/E-4|E-4]] both have their own debuff mechanic.

There has been reports of E-4 with debuff mechanism. This, however '''does not''' mean the debuff is related to armor breaking as the current mechanisms for this debuff is unknown. What is known is that:
* The boss' voice line changes when the debuff has been applied.

* There are 5 debuff nodes of which only 4 nodes are required for the player to S rank in order to apply the debuff effect, nodes C, D, H, I, K.

* There has been a few hearsay that the debuff is '''permanent'''. Therefore you only needed to do probably once per map (E-3 and E-4 only) to get the debuff effect happening. Debuff has also been confirmed not to reset even if you switch difficulties.

=== Why can't I sortie to E-? HELP!!! ===

If you follow this simple 3 step pathway, you should be on your way to sortieing to E_
#'''Correct Map'''
#*'''​'''You'd be surprised
#'''Correct Fleet'''
#*Single Fleet for Single Fleet maps
#*Combined Fleet for Combined Fleet maps
#*Transport Escort fleet for Transport Escort fleet maps etc.
#*Also, on '''Medium/Hard difficulty''', you mustn't have any ships that have been '''ship locked''' to a different tag colour. See [[Events/Mechanics#Ship_Locking|here]] for a hopefully foolproof explanation
#'''Minimum Requirements'''
#*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio
#*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships
#*Must have 20 free equipment slots

=== What is/are the drop rates for XXXXX, YYYYY, ZZZZZ ship? ===

Currently there are three sites with database on the drop rates. Information from those sites may not be neither complete nor accurate however they still form as part of the sources in terms of drops and drop verification apart from information sourced internally from the wiki itself:
* http://db.kcwiki.moe/drop/map/341/3/J-SAB.html
* http://kancolle-db.net
* https://myfleet.moe/entire/sta/drop_stage

For more information on how to navigate around these sites you may wish to refer to [[User_blog:Crazy_teitoku/Guide_to_navigating_around_drop_databases|this blog entry]].
