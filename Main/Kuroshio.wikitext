==Character==

===Appearance===
*Kuroshio wears a similar uniform to most members of the Asashio-class, as the Kagerou-class was based on the Asashio-class. She wears a school uniform-esque garment with a vest, blue neckerchief and black shorts underneath her skirt. She has gray hair with a gray hairpiece securing it in place.

===Personality===
*Kuroshio comes off as friendly and honest, showing a childhood friend-like behavior towards the commander, referring to them informally as "Chief" and generally talking to them in a casual manner rather then as a superior. She shrugs off achievement seemingly out of embarrassment as seen in her MVP line. She speaks in the Kansai dialect, similar to [[Ryuujou]].

==Trivia==
*Her name means "black tide", and refers to the north-flowing ocean current on the west side of the North Pacific (the [[wikipedia:Kuroshio_Current|Kuroshio Current]]).
**After WW2, her name was selected three times to the name of submarines. Primary JDS Kuroshio SS-501(1955-1966) was the ex-Gato class submarine USS Mingo SS-261, which was provided from the United States.The second was Uzushio class submarine JDS Kuroshio SS-570 (1974-1994) and Oyashio class JS Kuroshio SS-296 is active now (since 2004).
*Sunk in action, 8 May 1943.
* Along with [[Kagerou]] and [[Oyashio]], ran into a minefield, with Kuroshio sinking almost immediately. The other two would sink sometime later.
* Wreck discovered by accident by Robert Ballard, while he was searching for John F. Kennedy's PT-109 in May, 2002.
