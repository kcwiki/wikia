The final mass-production version of the Zero-fighter, "Type Zero Carrier-based Fighter Model 52".<br/>As the development of its successors were delayed, the Zero-fighter Type 52 fought bravely as the main late-war carrier-based fighter.<br/>Along with the "Suisei" dive bomber and "Tenzan" torpedo bomber, please use it as your mainstay air task-force.

The '''Mitsubishi A6M5 ''Zero''''' (''Type 0 Carrier-based fighter, Model 52'', Allied reporting name "Zeke") is the final mass-production (and perhaps most effective) variant of the Mitsubishi A6M.

Compared to the A6M2, the A6M5 had shorter wings and revised control surfaces while an improved exhaust system and cowling increased power delivery. Carbon-dioxide based fire extinguishers were added while the radio was updated. The A6M5 had a number of incremental updates throughout its various manufacturing lots.

Maximum speed was increased to 565 km/h at 6,000 m and it could reach that altitude in just over 7 minutes. Sub-variants include the [[Zero Fighter Type 52 Type C (601 Air Group)|A6M5c]], while the A6M6 and [[Type 62 Zero Fighter-bomber|A6M7 (Model 62)]] were adapted from the A6M5.
