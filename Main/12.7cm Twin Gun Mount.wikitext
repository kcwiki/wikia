The main gun of fleet destroyers.<br/>Shielded for defense toward splinters as well as bad weathers and equipped with powered turrets, this modern main gun for small vessels was equipped on most fleet <br/>Due to its low elevation angle, anti-air firing is not its forte.

|trivia = 
The main gun for most Japanese destroyers post-Mutsuki class except the Akizuki, Matsu and Tachibana classes. Has four major variants denoted A, B, C, D respectively (A being the oldest), the main differences between the variants being their weight and the gun's elevation angle. Type A only had 40°. and was extremely helpless when it came to AA firing. Maximum elevation angle was raised to 75° for the B and D-type while C-type had 55°, but its loading sequence required hand ramming and the firing rate at a high elevation angle was very low, making Japanese destroyers vulnerable to aerial attacks.
