|Library/En = I'm the Seaplane Tender Akitsushima!<br>That's right, I'm a Flying Boat Tender constructed for the sake of assisting Large-sized Flying Boat and refueling at sea, among other things!<br>Eh? Is my "makeup" too heavy? You're rude, maybe! I'm not letting you have Type 2 Taitei-chan, kay!

|Idle/En = This camouflage is flashy isn't it? Nah, that's not true, don't you agree, Taitei-chan? Don't you think so? Taitei-chan thinks so too, don't you? Ah, Admiral, is it time for our next mission?

|Secretary Married = 提督、なにをぼんやりしてるの？あっ、少し疲れちゃったかな？そういう時は、この秋津洲流肩もみ術を…ふふーん、ね、気持ちいいでしょ？

|Starting A Sortie/En = Now's the time, Akitsushima-style combat navigation technique, maybe I'll do it in a real battle!
|Starting A Sortie/Note = Akitsushima's art of navigation in battle is somewhat similar to the stunt seen in the ''"Battleship"'' movie[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edk_mAeU2kU], where the anchor is dropped on one side (starboard side in Akitsushima's case) and the ship is set to go full throttle. This technique would make Akitsushima turn hard to the starboard side and evade the incoming attack. This maneuver was supposedly performed by a ship during a battle in Rabaul. Also see Fubuki 4koma chapter 92 for details.

|Night Battle/En = N-Night battle!? Me? W-well, I guess I have no choice but to go, I think...

|Night Attack = 厚化粧ですって！？　失礼かも！
|Night Attack/En = Do you say I wear heavy makeup?  It's so rude!

|Night Attack/Kai = まーだ厚化粧とか言うの！？ほんっと失礼かも！
|Night Attack/Kai/En = You still say my makeup is heavy? It's really rude!

|MVP = ふぇ…えぇっ！あたしが一番なの！？そんなことって、あるかなぁ…えぇっ…
|MVP/En = E-Eh! I'm number one!? Is such a thing even possible... Eh...

|Minor Damage 1 = ひゃあーーっ！被弾！？
|Minor Damage 1/En = Hya! I'm hit!?

|Minor Damage 2 = あたしの迷彩塗装、あんまり役に立ってないかも…
|Minor Damage 2/En = My camouflage pattern might not have been very useful I think...

|Major Damage = やっ…やられたかもー。だから攻撃は得意じゃないっていったのに…
|Major Damage/En = T-...They beat me, I think. That's why I told you offense is not one of my fortes...

|Sunk = あたし沈むのね…大艇ちゃん、バイバイ。きっと未来は…
|Sunk/En = I see, I'm sinking... Taitei-chan, bye, bye. I'm sure the future will be...

==Character==
=== Personality ===
* Calls her plane "Nishiki-taitei-chan" (literally: "Type 2 Large Boat-chan") or simply "Taitei-chan" (literally: "Large Boat-chan").
* Sometimes she ends her sentence with the verbal tic "kamo" (かも).

=== '''Appearance''' ===
* Akitsushima has long purplish-grey hair pulled into a side ponytail of to her left with an ahoge, sidelocks, and hair ornament on top. She also has a very long hair ribbon on her right with two dangling anchors (Which seems like it would hurt...). She has purple eyes. She wears a mint green-and-white military uniform with black trim that includes a double-breasted jacket and pleated skirt. She wears thigh highs and a garter on one leg to create a zettai ryouiki effect.
* Akitsushima's earrings bear striking resemblance to the cross-looped antenna of radio direction finders [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_seaplane_tender_Akitsushima#/media/File:Japanese_seaplane_carrier_Akitushima.jpg found on the real-life ship]. The two antennas can be seen protruding from the superstructure, one directly behind the anti-air fire director and another behind the foremast.
* In her combat gear, she wears a small ship-like device strapped to her side by a clamp-like device attached to her hip. The most prominent features of the mini-ship are a large crane and a double-cannon turret near the back and front of the deck, respectively. She also wears red heel-like boots with a keel.

==Notes==
*[[Spring 2015 Event]] E-6 clear reward.
*In-game, Akitsushima is one of only three ships capable of equipping the {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Large-sized Flying Boat}} and {{EquipmentLink|PBY-5A Catalina}}, the other being {{ShipLink|Kamoi Kai Bo}} and {{ShipLink|Nisshin A}}
**Despite being a seaplane tender, she is unable to equip {{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki}} minisubs. She can still equip depth charges however.
**Akitsushima is only able to equip all [[:Category:Landing Craft|Daihatsu]] and {{EquipmentLink|Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank}} after remodeling.
**Unlike {{ShipLink|Mizuho}} and [[:Category:Chitose Class|Chitose class]] seaplane tenders, Akitsushima can equip {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Carrier-based Aircraft Maintenance Personnel}} after remodeling.
**She gains the ability to equip SONAR after remodeling, making her able to equip a depth charge + SONAR for the set bonus (with a seaplane bomber).
*If equipped with a flying boat, Akitsushima will deploy it during the opening air attack phase only if a {{ShipLink|Zuiun}} or other seaplane bomber is equipped as well, or if the enemy has a submarine.
*While her card icon and her intro line says that she is a Seaplane Tender, her formation line says that she is a Flying Boat Tender.

==Trivia==
* Akitsushima was given ship repair facilities after {{ShipLink|Akashi}} was destroyed, allowing her to act as a repair ship. She served in this capacity for only two months before her sinking.  
* Sunk by aircraft between Culion & Busuanga Islands, near Manglet Island at Coron Bay, Palawan, Philippines ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_seaplane_tender_Akitsushima&params=11_59_N_120_02_E_type:landmark_region:PH 11°59′0″N, 120°2′0″E]), 24 September 1944. Location also has other non-combat IJN ships nearby, including the food supply ship [[Irako]].
** Her wreck site and her very wreckage is a very popular diving spot, located at a depth of 20 - 36 metres (66 - 118 feet). It was first discovered by US Navy surveyors and became a tourist attraction since then.
** Divers/players wishing to come closer to Akitsushima's real life counterpart will require wreck diver certification, due to the presence of metal hazards from the airstrikes that sunk her.
* She was one of the ships implemented in celebration of KanColle's 2nd Anniversary.<ref>https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/594678124966641665</ref>
* Her name was first carried by a 1894 protected cruiser sole in her class. It is now carried by a Japan Coast Guard ship.
* Her clothes and gear's coloring is based on the actual ship's peculiarly garish camouflage.
* Her plane "Nishiki-taitei-chan" is actually alive, as if it can express it's emotions and interact with other kanmusume besides Akitsushima. This is surprisingly proven in Fubuki Ganbarimusu! Chapter 135, even though several things in the manga are not canon to the online game.
