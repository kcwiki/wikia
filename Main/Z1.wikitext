* Since [[Thread:267114|12th June 2015 Update]], Z1 is also now obtainable via [[World_4:_%E8%A5%BF%E6%96%B9%E6%B5%B7%E5%9F%9F#World_4-5:_.E3.80.90Extra_Operation.E3.80.91_.E3.82.AB.E3.83.AC.E3.83.BC.E6.B4.8B.E3.83.AA.E3.83.A9.E3.83.B3.E3.82.AB.E5.B3.B6.E6.B2.96_Curry_Ocean_Ri-Lanka_Island|World 4-5: 【Extra Operation】 カレー洋リランカ島沖 Curry Ocean Ri-Lanka Island]]; 
* It is also possible to obtain Z1 from World 4-5 without the need to go through the former method of completing the quest chain in order to obtain Z1. 
:* What is unknown however is whether or not Z1 obtained via World 4-5 can be used to construct {{ShipLink|Z3}} and/or {{ShipLink|Bismarck}} ''without'' completing the quest chain. 

== Trivia ==
* As with [[Z3]] and many Type 1934 destroyers, she was named after a German naval officer who died during World War&nbsp;I.
* Lost during Operation Wikinger, a push to target British fishing, when she was hit by a bomb from a friendly [[Wikipedia:Heinkel_He_111|He 111 bomber]] and sunk on February 22nd, 1940. [[Z3]] was also lost to a mine in the ensuring confusion.
* The "Z" in her name stands for ''Zerstörer'', which is German for ''destroyer''.
* She received her second remodel on [http://pastebin.com/PVTHWkbd 28/03/2014], together with Z3 and [[Kirishima]].
* 改 means "remodeled" (for the first time), 改二 means "remodeled a second time", etc. However, German ships use ''Zwei'' (two) for 改二, omitting the 改, because the developers probably thought that it sounds or looks cool and German is ''exotic'' (via [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Suggestion/@comment-Dragonjet-20150121132253/@comment-Admiral_Mikado-20150121195611?permalink=162628#comm-162628 Admiral Mikado]).
