==Information==
*The preboss fleets consist mostly of CA/CL/DD.
**Node {{Event/Route|G|red}} has two Ta-class battleships.
**Node {{Event/Route|D|red}} is mostly a mix of surface ships and submarines.
*At least 36/72 air power is needed to achieve AS/AS+ at boss node. There are no carriers anywhere else in the map.

==Compositions==
*{{Event/Route|C|red|F|blue|H|red|J|red}} or {{Event/Route|A|red|B|green|D|red|H|red|J|red}}.
**1 CA(V) 1 CL 4 DD
***Cheapest composition, but requires high-level CL and DD as they need to dodge the closing torpedo if they didn't disable all of the enemies CA, CL and DD in advance
*{{Event/Route|C|red|F|blue|D|red|H|red|J|red}} or {{Event/Route|A|red|B|green|D|red|H|red|J|red}}.
**1 CL 2 DD 3 AV/CLT/CA(V)
**1 CL 2 DD 2 CA(V) 1 (F)BB(V)/CV(L)
***Will always fight 3 battles pre-boss, but allow stronger ships that helps withstand enemy shots compared to the light comp above
*{{Event/Route|C|red|F|blue|D|red|G|red|J|red}} or {{Event/Route|A|red|B|green|D|red|G|red|J|red}}.
**2 CV(L) 1 CLT 3 XX (XX is not another (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B))
***Heaviest comp, but slightly harder pre-boss, as you will always go to node G where [[Battleship Ta-Class]] are awaiting, in exchange, you get to bring CV(L) for opening airstrike and more firepower on the way to the boss and at the boss node itself.
