*Submarines can only be attacked by destroyers, light cruisers, torpedo cruisers, aviation battleships/cruisers with seaplane bombers, and some light aircraft carriers. In addition, they prioritize attacking submarines first meaning other ships can get away with no damage done to them.
*Submarines are the most resource-efficient class in the game; they cost almost nothing to deploy or repair. Furthermore, they constitute cheap additions towards multiple expeditions that can utilize them.
*Submarines equipped with [[Kouhyouteki]] will perform a preemptive torpedo strike before the shelling phase. After reaching level 10, they'll be able to preemptively attack without any equipment at all.
*SSVs have doubled repair time compared to SS. I-58, I-8, I-26, and I-19 turn into SSV after remodelling. I-168, U-511 and Maruyu do '''not''' turn into SSV after remodelling, so they can always be remodeled without worrying about increased repair times.
