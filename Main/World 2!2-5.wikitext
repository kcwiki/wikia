===Tips===
*Use of High LoS Equipment such as {{EquipmentLink|Saiun|Type 2 Reconnaissance Aircraft|text=Recon Aircraft}} on CVL, {{EquipmentLink|Type 0 Reconnaissance Seaplane|text=Seaplane}} and {{EquipmentLink|Type 32 Surface Radar|Type 33 Surface Radar|text=Radars}} on your Surface Ships is mandatory to reach the minimum LoS '''(F33)''' {{LOS}} requirement as listed below.
**Please be advised that your Ships' Level matters as well, as a Ship gains higher LoS values from higher levels.
***This is most critical for the North Route which requires much higher LoS and especially for the Monthly [[Quests#Bm7|Quest Bm7]] as well, which requires to use 4 Destroyers whose fleet will have trouble reaching the required minimum LoS (F33) Value if lacking in Levels and/or High LoS Equipment.
****Another option in such case is to turn a single Destroyer in the Fleet into a LoS mule with multiple Radars.

===Recommended Fleets===
====South Route====
{{Event/Route|C|red|E|red|I|blue|O|red}}
*1 CV 1 CVL 1 CL 3 DD '''(Fast Fleet Only)'''
**LoS '''(F33)''' {{LOS}} Cn=1 must be '''34.0''' or higher in order to have 100% chance to pass the check.

====North Route====
{{Event/Route|B|red|F|red|J|red|O|red}}
*1 BBV 2 CAV 3 CA
**1 {{Drum}} {{EquipmentLink|Drum Canister (Transport Use)|text=Drum Canister}} must be equipped on each CAV.
***LoS '''(F33)''' {{LOS}} Cn=1 must be '''49.0''' or higher to succeed at 100% chance the check.
***Recommended for [[Quests#Bm1|Monthly Quest Bm1]].
*3 BB(V) 3CA(V)
**Also requires 2 Drum canisters equipped on 2 out of the 3 CA(V)s, and goes through the same route as with the 1 BBV 2CAV 3CA fleet.
**While this fleet cannot guarantee routing for Bm1 like the option above, it is a much heavier variant, and thus can deal with the boss node more easily, especially in the case of low-medium level player fleets.
**Recommended to use {{ShipLink|Ise/Kai Ni}} or {{ShipLink|Hyuuga/Kai Ni}} for her ability to carry [[List of Fighters by stats|carrier-based fighters]], and thus reduce or outright remove the need for seaplane fighter muling.

====Monthly [[Quests#Bm7|Quest Bm7]] Fleet====
{{Event/Route|B|red|F|red|E|red|I|blue|O|red}}
*DD '''(Flagship)'''+ 1 CA 1 CL 3 DD '''(Fast Fleet Only)'''
**LoS '''(F33)''' {{LOS}} Cn=1 must be '''34.0''' or higher to succeed at 100% chance the check.
**Due to the restriction on the usage of CAVs, seaplane fighter-carrying CLs ({{ShipLink|Yura/Kai Ni}} or {{ShipLink|Tama/Kai Ni}}) or Italian CAs ({{ShipLink|Zara/Due}} or {{ShipLink|Pola/Kai}}) are practically mandatory to survive the boss node, especially in the case of encountering the Wo formation. The air power supplied by them is enough to gain Air Parity, preventing the enemy BBs from performing Artillery Spotting on the player fleet and massively increasing the chance of player ships surviving into night battle.
