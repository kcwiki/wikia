==Character==

===Appearance===
*Yayoi wears a purplish shirt which bares her midriff with a black skirt. She wears black and white knee socks similar to those worn by the Fubuki class, and has long lavender hair held in place with the distinctive moon-shaped trinket the Mutsuki-class share. Her main gun has a tattered ribbon on it in remembrance of a lost comrade, this being [[Kisaragi]], who was lost very early on in the war.
*In her normal art, both her eyes are of different colors; her left eye is sky blue and her right is lavender, though that could be due to lighting effects. This trait is not carried over to her Valentine's Day art or her [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kancolle/images/5/53/Illustration-2016-06-07-A.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160607171952 commemorative 3rd anniversary art], where both her eyes are lavender in the former and sky blue in the latter.

===Personality===
*Yayoi is rather emotionless when compared to the other members of her class. She speaks in a similar manner to [[Kaga]]. She is often mistaken as being angry due to the expression on her face.

==Trivia==
*Sunk in Air attack, September 11, 1942 northeast of Vakuta Island, Papua New Guinea ([http://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Yayoi_%281925%29&params=08_45_S_151_25_E__region:#regional 08°45′S 151°25′E]).
*Her name is an archaic word for the month of March.
**It was first carried by the third Torpedo Boat Destroyer of the First Kamikaze class in 1905.
*The tattered ribbon on her left hand gun barrel (right side of the card), which she holds onto in her damaged art, is [[Kisaragi]]'s (who Yayoi was in Destroyer Division 30 with, and was lost very early in the war).

== Quests ==
* Required by Quests [[Quests#A33|A33]], [[Quests#A34|A34]], [[Quests#B22|B22]] and [[Quests#B24|B24]].
