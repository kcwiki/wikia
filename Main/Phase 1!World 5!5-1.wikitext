'''Note:''' You must have cleared [[3-4]] and [[4-4]] first, before this stage can be accessed.
===Tips===
*Two CA/CAV to guarantee sortie start -> A and H -> I (boss) route
*Two DD for C to H.
* Node D is an all sub node, Node A has 2/3 chance of having one sub, and Boss Node I has 1/3 chance of having one sub
* As a method to level DDs, you can take six of them at once and arrive at sub node 75% of the time. Furthermore, you can ignore morale while receiving high exp at very low costs.
** Low level DDs can have some problems so you might want to wait out morale or take BB for second shelling and better MVP control.
