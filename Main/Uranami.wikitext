== Character ==
===Appearance===
* Similar to her sister-shipgirls, she has dark brown hair and brown eyes. Her long hair is tied into a single braid that is swept to the front of her right shoulder.
* Although she is listed as a Special Type I (Fubuki-class) destroyer, she is actually of an intermediary design between the Types I and II, with the funnels of the later type but with the guns of the earlier type. As such, she wears a variant of the "basic" uniform: a blue-and-white short-sleevedserafuku but with a brown collar (blue sailor collar) and a brown neckerchief characteristic of Shibafu's Ayanami-class. She completes the set with a blue pleated skirt, black kneehighs, and a red ribbon on her braid.
* Her rigging consists of a smokestack carried like a backpack, a torpedo launcher strapped to either thigh, and a twin-cannon turret held in her right hand. Her official art also has her swinging an anchor in her left hand.
=== Personality ===
* Uranami has a similar "forthright energetic" personality to Fubuki, although with a somewhat more tomboyish edge. She also has a strong respect for/dependency upon her sister-ship, "Isonami-nee-san", referring to her or asking for help from her whenever she is in trouble. She similarly has a strong attachment to her other historic division-mates, Ayanami and Shikinami.
==Notes==
*Added as a drop-only ship during an update on [[Thread:483869|16th September 2016]]. While initially hinted as a drop on [[2-4]], she has since been spotted on [[4-1]], [[5-1]] and [[6-2]] as well. Also dropped at Fall Event 2016 Boss node.

==Trivia==
*Sunk by approximately 80 aircraft from four of the escort carriers of Task Force 77.4.2 "Taffy 2" (USS ''Manila Bay'', ''Marcus Island'', ''Natoma Bay'', and ''Petrof Bay'') on high noon of 26 October 1944, in Jintotolo Channel between Masbate and Panay, Philippines. Sunk [https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Uranami_%281928%29&params=11_50_N_123_00_E_region:PH_type:landmark|11°50′N 123°00′E] southeast of Masbate.
* Although currently undiscovered, she is believed to reside in a divable depth, as [[Kinu]] sank around the same area, whose wreckage was explored in 1945 by divers from the USS Chanticleer.
