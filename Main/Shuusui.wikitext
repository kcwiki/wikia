|en = The Army and Navy cooperated, utilizing the technology of the Me163, plus supplements and improvements from Japan's own technologies, in an attempt to create the high altitude interceptor Shuusui. While the original was never completed, this plane is a hypothetical version which has been assigned to various units, and overcome a number of defects to see combat use. Let loose a lethal arrow against the terrifying bombers attacking from high altitudes!

*Shuusui is considered in-game as a '''high altitude interceptor'''.
*'''High Altitude Interceptors''' multiply the total air power of all land bases in Air Defense mode, when defending against enemy High-Altitude Bombers. The multiplier depends on the number of high altitude interceptors equipped:
** '''0:''' x0.5 (Total Air Power is halved)
**'''1:''' x0.8
**'''2:''' x1.1
**'''3 or more:''' x1.2
