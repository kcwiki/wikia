{{Under Construction}}This page record any hints about what's upcoming for KanColle and other closely-related media from everywhere, that are not on the [[Recent Updates]] page either because that are too far away (for instance, content expected to come after more than half year) or because the source of those information are not as credible as official twitter announcement.

Outdated hints will be deleted from this page, an archive for them to check for source reliability is currently under consideration.
