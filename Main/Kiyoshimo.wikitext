==Character==
===Appearance===
===Personality===
*She, just like Libeccio,  is an excitable girl. She wants to become a battleship due to her admiration of the battleship Musashi; as such, it is not uncommon to draw her with [http://i.imgur.com/PLmSqh4.jpg Musashi's] [https://68.media.tumblr.com/922c53333ae87fce0fc63ce214a50e2b/tumblr_ng4b5yIAko1r2gyilo1_500.png or another battleship's rigging], [https://68.media.tumblr.com/147c47c72e0a231a1519e92de3ebfe15/tumblr_nl4volD0IQ1rvzrnqo1_500.jpg only to collapse under the weight].

==Trivia==
* Her name means "''Clear Frost''".
* Her love for battleships refers to her assisting battleship Musashi in the Battle of Sibuyan Sea and rescuing Musashi's survivors.
* Sunk during Operation Rei-Go on 26 December 1944. Crippled by USAAF bombers during the approach to Mindoro and finished off by PT-223 at 12°20′N 121°0′E.
