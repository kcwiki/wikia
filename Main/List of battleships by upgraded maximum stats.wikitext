Notes:
* [[:Category:Kongou Class|Kongou-class]] battleships start with 3 slots and then upgrade to 4 after remodeling.
* [[Fusou Kai Ni]] and [[Yamashiro Kai Ni]] come with rare equipment ([[Prototype 41cm Triple Gun Mount]] and [[Zuiun Model 12]]) but requires blueprint.
* [[Bismarck drei]], [[Gangut]], [[Gangut|Gangut Dva]] and [[:Category:Kongou Class|Kongou-class Kai Ni Cs]] have the ability to launch torpedoes.
* [[Gangut]], along with her remodels, are classified as Fast Battleships, despite having slow speed.
** This allows her to meet Fleet composition requirements for Fast Battleships (for example, she can be used as in the escort fleet of a combined fleet), but will be considered a slow ship in map branching, and make any fleet she is a part of a slow fleet.
* [[Roma Kai]] and [[Italia]] can equip and launch [[List of Seaplanes by stats|Seaplane Bombers and Seaplane Fighters]] but they still count as Fast Battleships
* [[:Category:Ise Class|Ise-class]] and [[:Category:Fusou Class|Fusou-class]] will change into [[EliteBBV|Aviation Battleships]] after remodeling.
** Aviation Battleships equipped with [[List of Seaplanes by stats|Seaplane Bombers]] and [[Ka-type Observation Autogyro|Autogyro]] can take part in the Opening Airstrike and attack Submarines.
** Planes can be launched at {{color|orange|中破 (moderate damage)}}.
