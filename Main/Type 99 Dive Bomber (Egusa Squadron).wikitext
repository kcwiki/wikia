The "Type 99 Dive Bomber" formed the backbone of strike groups of the Carrier Task Force at the beginning of hostilities.<br/>Despite being of old design with a slow speed and fixed landing gear, it was highly reliable, especially when used by the veteran Egusa Squadron renowned for their impressive dive bombing accuracy.

Takashige Egusa was a highly skilled and accurate dive bombing pilot who served on [[Souryuu]]. He led the second attack wave on Pearl Harbor, assault on Wake Island, Port Darwin and sunk a handful of Royal Navy ships but was badly injured during Midway, stopping his rampant dominance. When he returned to duty, he was shot down by a VT Fuze while under very heavy Anti-aircraft fire flying a [[Ginga]].
* His reputation earned him the nickname "God of Dive bombing" by his squad members.
* He achieved an impressive 87% hit rate at the end of his career.
* Crew of the USS San Jacinto were reportedly not happy by how Japanese command willingly risked one of the most talented pilots of the war in an act of desperation, but still recognized his military bravery, "dying like a respectable samurai in the battlefield".
