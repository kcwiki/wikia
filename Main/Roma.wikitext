==Notes==
* [[Spring 2015 Event]] E-6 Drop.
* [[Summer 2015 Event]] E-5 Drop.
* [[Fall 2015 Event]] E-4 Drop.
* The 24 February Ranking update allows the Italian battleships and heavy cruisers to launch Seaplane Bombers and Seaplane Fighters (such as [[Zuiun]], [[Prototype Seiran]] and [[Ro.44 Seaplane Fighter]]) while retaining their current classification after remodeling.

==Trivia==
* Named after the city of Rome, the capital city of Italy.

* Sunk en-route to Malta following the Armistice of Cassibile by German ''Luftwaffe''<nowiki/>'s Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. These guided bombs were dropped from altitudes of 8000 meters on angles of 80°, out of range of Italian anti-aircraft fire of 3000 meters and far more vertical angle that the normal of 60°.
** The first bomb launched at 3:42 pm pierced Roma from her upper deck all the way down between the towers #1 and #9 of [[90mm Single High-angle Gun Mount]], flooding and reducing her speed. The second bomb launched at 3:52 pm, pierced near the #2 turret of the [[OTO 152mm Triple Rapid Fire Gun Mount]], passing 4 decks and landing on one of the Roma's main guns magazine. The force of the explosion (that eventually sank Roma) blew the entire main gun #2 turret out of it's mount. This explains why her second turret is missing in her damaged CG.
* Wreck discovered in 2012 by an underwater robot named Pluto Palla, designed by Italian engineer Guido Gay. It was discovered around 16 nautical miles (30 kilometres) off the northern coast of Sardinia at a depth of around 1,000 metres (3,300 feet).. A video of the exploration can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjGrRFm6w5s here].
* The red and white stripes come from the distinctive markings fitted on the bow of all Italian ships after the Battle of Punta Stilo (1940), during which Italian bombers couldn't distinguish between the Italian and the British ships; the light/dark grey pattern on her corset is a reference to the later camouflage scheme adopted by some Italian ships during the war.
* Although the other glasses wearing shipgirls use modern glasses, Roma uses late 19th century style glasses called ''Pince-nez, ''specifically the [http://cliparts.co/cliparts/pTo/5Ra/pTo5RakTE.jpg female version.]Popular at the time, it comes with a hair pin to hold the glasses securely on her face as seen on her CG.
* There is a running gag that Roma becomes Libeccio's guardian(as she always asked Ooyodo a permission to escort Libeccio during an operation or sortie in any "campaigns"(As they are references to Events in the game itself). This running gag is shown in several chapters of Fubuki Ganbarimasu![http://www.mangahere.co/manga/kantai_collection_kankore_4_koma_comic_fubuki_ganbarimasu/c147/2.html][http://www.mangahere.co/manga/kantai_collection_kankore_4_koma_comic_fubuki_ganbarimasu/c136/3.html][http://www.mangahere.co/manga/kantai_collection_kankore_4_koma_comic_fubuki_ganbarimasu/c110/2.html]
