|en = As they have become somewhat obsolete, the surplus 12.7cm Twin Mount Type A turrets have undergone a thorough modernization. One of wartime modifications in this models is the implementation of dual-purpose guns. Improved maximum elevation, loading mechanism replacement and coupling with an anti-aircraft fire director are just a few of multiple improvements aimed at coping with reality of anti-aircraft warfare. All these refinements resulted in a destroyer gun turret designed for the Special Type destroyers which is entirely different from the conventional Type A model. Additionally, thanks to the use of dual-purpose guns it has become a viable anti-aircraft armament.
