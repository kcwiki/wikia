|en = The cutting-edge carrier-based fighter Reppuu was developed as a successor to the famous zero fighter. The original high-altitude interceptor Reppuu Kai was further developed and perfected for anti-fighter combat and carrier-based usage, its angled guns were removed, and its performance was improved to create the Reppuu Kai 2. This is a hypothetical equipment, but please allow it to defend your CarDiv 1 and your elite kidou butai!
