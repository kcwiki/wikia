That is the [[Events/Mechanics#Vanguard Formation (警戒陣)|Vanguard formation]], a formation only available during events. Put shortly, it is a defensive formation, and can be used on any map like any other formation for the duration of the event. The above link contains more precise information about its behavior.

== Can the flagship of the 2nd fleet in a Combined Fleet sink? ==

<div style = "text-align:right">[[#top|back to top]]</div>

== Why can't I sortie to E-? HELP!!! ==

Make sure you are doing the following:
#'''Sortieing to the Correct Map'''
#*'''''You'd be surprised'''''
#'''Using the Correct Fleet type'''
#*Single Fleet for Single Fleet maps
#*Combined Fleet for Combined Fleet maps
#*Transport Escort fleet for Transport Escort fleet map, etc.
#'''Using Ships with the correct Ship Lock'''
#*On '''Medium/Hard difficulty''', you cannot have any ships that have been '''ship locked''' to a different tag colour from what the given map allows. See [[Events/Mechanics#Ship_Locking|here]] for a more thorough explanation of what ship locking is. 
#'''Meet the Minimum Requirements'''
#*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio
#*Must have 5 empty ship slots
#*Must have 20 free equipment slots

== Which event-only ships can we get in this event? ==

:See the table below for previous event only specific drops.
{{Event Drop}}

<div style = "text-align:right">[[#top|back to top]]</div>

== What is/are the drop rates for XXXXX, YYYYY, ZZZZZ ship? ==

Currently there are three sites with database on the drop rates. Information from those sites may not be neither complete nor accurate however they still form as part of the sources in terms of drops and drop verification apart from information sourced internally from the wiki itself:
* https://db.kcwiki.org/drop/
* https://myfleet.moe/entire/sta/drop_stage
* http://opendb.swaytwig.com/

For more information on how to navigate around these sites you may wish to refer to [[User_blog:Crazy_teitoku/Guide_to_navigating_around_drop_databases|this blog entry]].
