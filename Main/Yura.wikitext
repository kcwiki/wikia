==Character==
===Appearance===
*Yura wears a plain school uniform identical to [[Kinu]]'s and [[Abukuma]]'s prior to the latter two's second remodel. She has pink hair done up in an abnormally long ponytail trailing behind her, secured by an absurdly long black ribbon tied around her hair multiple times.
**After her 2nd Remodel, she now wears a different serafuku now with a black, light brown and gray pattern similar to [[Abukuma]] and [[Kinu]]. However, she ditches the bicycle shorts seen underneath the former two's shorts, even though [https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/kancolle/images/a/a6/Yura_and_yuubari_kantai_collection_drawn_by_konishi_koconatu_eb00590b1c9f9c6396926010bd8ca52c.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170522181236 older art] shows her with bicycle shorts. As for her battle kit, she now carries 2 pistol-like 12.7cm twin guns. Torpedo tubes are attached to her boots along with as a shield-like platform with AA guns and Radar attached to it. As with Abukuma, she can carry a midget submarine and a transport ship. As the remodel is hypothetical, she needs a high level and a blueprint to remodel to this point.

===Personality===
*Yura appears to be calm, hard-working and responsible, wanting to help the Admiral and her fellow shipgirls.
*She speaks in a calm tone, and often gets straight to the point with short sentences.
*Her idle line and her 05:00 hourly line show that she likes doing the laundry. [[Sagiri]]'s idle line implies that Yura was the shipgirl doing the laundry.
*She, like some other kanmusu, has a catchphrase, with hers being "ね？" (Okay?). Sometimes she says it twice for emphasis.

==Notes==
*After her second remodel, Yura is capable of using the [[Kouhyouteki]] mini-sub to perform opening torpedo salvos, effectively making her a Torpedo Cruiser. However, she is still listed as a Light Cruiser and is treated as such in branching rules.
*Yura Kai Ni is also the first Light Cruiser capable of using [[List_of_Seaplanes_by_stats#Seaplane_Bombers|Seaplane Bombers]] and [[List_of_Seaplanes_by_stats#Seaplane_Fighters|Seaplane Fighters]] to perform opening airstrikes and/or establish air superiority.
**She is also the first light cruiser that can equip [[SCAMP]].
*Capable of performing AACI with any High-angle mount  [[File:GreenGunDP.png]] plus Anti-air RADAR [[File:Radar.png]]. This setup is assigned with fixed API value of 21 (+5 shotdown).
*Yura Kai Ni can also equip:
**[[:Category:Landing_Craft|Landing Craft]] and [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]]
**[[8cm High-angle Gun]] and [[8cm High-angle Gun Kai + Additional Machine Guns]] in her [[Reinforcement Expansion]] slot.

==Trivia==
*She received her Kai Ni on the 6/23/2017 update.
*Named after the [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%B1%E8%89%AF%E5%B7%9D Yura] River in the Kansai region of Japan, not to be confused with the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yura_River Yura River in Bolivia].
**Her name lives on as the JDS Yura (LSU 4171) landing craft.
*Laid down on May 21, 1921, launched February 15, 1922, and commissioned on March 20, 1923.
*Her ability to carry Seaplane Bombers and Fighters may be a reference to how she was used as a test platform for aircraft catapults in 1930.
*Yura was involved in the sinking of Prince Wales and Repulse, and covered the landings of Japanese troops in Malaya and Sarawak. Afterwards, she participated in the Indian Ocean raid, the Battle of Midway, and the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. 
*Scuttled 25 October 1942 after bombing by USAAF aircraft off Savo Island [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Yura&params=08_15_S_159_07_E_ 08°15′S 159°07′E].
