|en = This is a late model upgrade of the gun developed by the USN for their treaty heavy cruisers that was mounted on them in triple mounts. It possesses great firepower even though it is just a basic mounting of three 20cm guns in a single turret. This refined and upgraded model was used as the main guns of the USN's Northampton-class treaty heavy cruisers.
