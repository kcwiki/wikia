== Character ==
===Appearance===
=== Personality ===
* Takanami has a personality that is lacking in confidence. Her verbal tic is "かも" or "kamo", which usually means "maybe". The homophone "kamo" (written "鴨") can also mean duck, if an artist is up for some puns. She is often shown with ducks or duck-themed alternate clothing for this reason. This verbal tic is shared with Akitsushima, who was introduced at the same time.
==Notes==
* [[Spring 2015 Event]] E-3 & E-4 Drop.
* [[Summer 2015 Event]] E-4 Boss node drop.

==Trivia==
*Her name means "Tall Wave".
*Sunk in action, 30 November 1942, <span style="font-weight:400;">during the </span>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tassafaronga Battle of Tassafaronga]<span style="font-weight:400;"> </span> by gunfire from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Minneapolis_(CA-36) USS Minneapolis] . Her wreck lies <span style="font-weight:400;">several miles south-southwest of Savo</span> Island, close from [[Akatsuki]]'s, both at [http://ict.sopac.org/VirLib/TR0280.pdf 800 m] below sea level.
**Completed on 31 August 1942, Takanami thus served only for 92 days to the Imperial Navy. This is reflected in-game by her low luck stats.
*Takanami spotted the US fleet before their radar spotted the IJN fleet at Tassafaronga. This is reflected by her remodel having [[Skilled Lookouts]].
*Her name survives as the name of the lead ship of the ''Takanami''-class guided missile destroyers, which entered service with the JMSDF from 2003 onwards.
