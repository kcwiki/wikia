== Character ==

=== Appearance ===
* Aoba wears a serafuku with a yellow neckerchief, blue shorts, black stockings and obscured shoes. She has pink hair tied into a ponytail, secured by a bluish hair tie. In [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VqG0rOv8N0 recent promotional material for ''Kancolle Arcade''], Aoba's serafuku bares her midriff and is seen wearing black shoes.

=== Personality ===
* In the fandom, she's depicted as being a curious and nosy reporter, always snooping around for the next scoop.

==Trivia==
*[[wikipedia:Unno Juza|Unno Juza]], a novelist considered the father of Japanese sci-fi, was aboard Aoba during WWII. Referring to this, in-game Aoba always mentions collecting material (news, info, gossip) for her work.
*The Aoba class was inspired from the Furutaka class. They retained a very similar hull design and torpedo tubes placement ; however, Aoba was mounted with 3 double 203mm turrets, while Furutaka had 6 single 200mm which was later upgraded to 3 double 203mm turrets.
*During the Battle of Cape Esperance, it was reported that Aoba considered the US fleet to be a Japanese fleet undergoing landing operations nearby, and signaled "I AM AOBA" toward the US fleet repeatedly using her signal lamp.
**Fubuki, who was closest to the US fleet, and Furutaka, who turned on her own search light to lure the enemy in an attempt to allow Aoba to retreat, were sunk in this battle.
**Some sources stated that she signaled "WHO (are you), WHO" repeatedly instead.
*Sunk July 28, 1945 by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USN USN] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAAF USAAF] aircraft at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kure,_Hiroshima Kure, Hiroshima] [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Aoba&params=34_14_N_132_30_E_ 34°14′N132°30′E].
