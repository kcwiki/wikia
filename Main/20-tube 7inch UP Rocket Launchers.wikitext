|en = A multi-tube rocket launcher that was developed in the land of black tea and used for short range anti-aircraft defence on large ships among other things. Its rockets are much larger than the 12cm Rosa projectiles used by Japanese rocket launchers. Using it on warships from the land of black tea as well as certain battleships, either with Pom-Pom guns or several grouped together, allows it to provide short range anti-aircraft defence, albeit to a limited extent.

|trivia = 
In 1940s, some ships were given 20-tube 7in rocket launchers (for "unrotated projectiles" [UP]) on turret tops. Each rocket carried aloft a line, at the end of which was an aerial mine suspended from a parachute. In theory, an approaching aircraft fouled the line and brought the mine down itself.
