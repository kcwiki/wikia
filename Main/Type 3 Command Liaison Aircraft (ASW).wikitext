The Type 3 Liaison fixed-wing aircraft (Kokusai Ki-76) was an Army project developed for anti-submarine operations.<br/>Similar to the STOL (Short Take-off and Landing) aircraft of today, this aircraft is carried aboard warships as an anti-submarine aircraft.<br/>It can use the flight decks of a landing ship or a light aircraft carrier.

|notes = 
* Any light carriers equipped with this aircraft will also need to be equipped with a dive-bomber or torpedo bomber that has anti-submarine stat, to be able to perform ASW attacks during the shelling phase. [[Kasuga Maru|Taiyou]] can perform OASW with this plane equipped, but the same rule applies to her as well during the shelling phase.
