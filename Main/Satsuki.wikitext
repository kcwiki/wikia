==Character==

===Appearance===
*Satsuki wears a black serafuku with a white tie, a black dress and black stockings. She has blonde hair styled into twintails with the Mutsuki-class' distinctive crescent moon-shaped trinket on her necktie.
**After her second remodel, she wears a modified version of the outfit she wore pre-second remodel; this outfit is shared with [[Fumizuki]] on the latter's second remodel. Her rigging has changed substantially, such as her switching out her old 12cm cannons for 25mm anti-aircraft cannons. Torpedoes are seen strapped to a bandolier on her outfit, and torpedo tubes are seen strapped to her stockings. Her crescent moon-shaped trinket has now been relocated to her left collar; interestingly, this was where Fumizuki's trinket was pre-second remodel.

===Personality===
*Satsuki is tomboyish, but still retains some elements of femininity.

==Notes==
*Satsuki's Kai Ni form allows her to equip [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]] and all it's variants.
*Has a unique Anti-Air Cut-In setup which requires only a [[25mm Triple Autocannon Mount (Concentrated Deployment)]].

==Trivia==
*Sunk in air attack September 21, 1944 at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Bay Manila Bay], Philippines ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Satsuki&params=14_35_N_120_45_E_ 14°35′N 120°45′E]). Refloated and scrapped around 10 years later along with 4 others.
*Her name is an archaic word for "May", as the fifth month of the outmoded lunar calendar.
*Satsuki's Kai Ni damaged art depicts her carrying a white wooden sword handle and sheathe on her clothes. This is a reference to a sword gifted to her captain, Lieutenant Commander Iino Tadao, as a reward for his exploits during an air raid in Kavieng, New Ireland, in 1944. 
*Received her Kai ni on 29th February 2016.

== [[Quests]] ==
*Required by Quests [[Quests#A49|A49]], [[Quests#B39|B39]], [[Quests#A66|A66]], [[Quests#B60|B60]], [[Quests#B72|B72]].
