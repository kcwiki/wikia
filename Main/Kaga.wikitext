During construction Amagi was damaged beyond repair in the great Kanto Earthquake (1923) and Kaga took her place for conversion.

| 19Note = Niku(meat)jaga(short for jagaimo=potato) is a traditional Japanese stew, which was allegedly invented by chefs of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the late 19th century, after Admiral Togou Heihachirou returned from his studying in England, and wanted to replicate the beef stew he had in there. The chef had no idea what a beef stew was, so he tried to use Japanese ingredients to match Togou's description, resulted in the invention.

| 22EN = 2200 hours...night battle...you say? I shall refuse.
| 22Note = For some reason she actually said 2210 hours. Between fans (esp. Japanese) of Kancolle, "having a night battle with a ship girl" is a implicit way to describe having sex with her. Kaga probably took the invitation (presumably from the admiral, aka the player) literally, and refused due to the fact that carriers cannot operate at night.<br>
Alternative: The line just refers to Sendai like many other shipgirls talking in their hourly lines to or over Sendai around the same time.
| 23JP = フタサンマルマル…本日は良い一日でした。明日もそうありたいものです。
| 23EN = 2300 hours...Today was a great day. I shall be thankful if tomorrow will be the same.

==Character==
[[File:Anime kaga.png|thumb|200px]]
===Appearance===
* Kaga has long brown hair, usually done in a side ponytail. She is typically seen wearing a muneate over white and blue clothes along with a bow and arrow. Her flight decks (one covering her left arm and another shorter one hanging around her waist) feature a katakana カ (ka) written on the aft part of each of them. This refers to how her identification mark was painted historically.

===Personality===
* Kaga is a very serious woman with a no-nonsense attitude. She speaks with very little emotion and enthusiasm most of the time, and she keeps words to herself more often than not. Underneath her usual facade, however, there are instances in which a more caring and gentle personality makes itself more apparent. The reason for her usual stoic nature is not expanded on, however.
* Her contrast with Akagi, her usual companion, offsets the playful and more easygoing personality that Akagi usually lets on. However, it can be said that due to the contrast and that Akagi lets her emotions show more often, Akagi's diligence and sincerity is more apparent than that of Kaga's though they both possess that quality.
* Kaga's less stoic side is often seen near Akagi, indicating that Kaga does not open up very much even around people she considers close friends but that she does, can, and will open up with people she trusts and loves. 
* She appears to be somewhat prideful, hinted at in her relationship with the Fifth Carrier Division. She refuses to outright admit being on a similar, let alone equal, level with the girls of the Fifth Carrier Division and tends to emphasize her position in the First Carrier Division, and the First Carrier Division itself as a whole in relation to the Fifth, as one of great importance. However, this trait does not manifest outside of her relations with the Fifth Carrier Division, so it is entirely possible that it is limited to them.
* Interactions with others indicate that Kaga is polite, respectful, considerate, and mindful of other individuals at almost all times if not all times. She possesses an air of formality and professionalism that few of the other girls could possibly imitate. 

==Trivia==
*Named after the [[wikipedia:Kaga_Province|Kaga Province]] which is now part of the [[wikipedia:Ishikawa_Prefecture|Ishikawa Prefecture]] in modern-day Japan.
*Exploded and sunk after being heavily damaged by dive bombers from USS Enterprise at the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Midway|Battle of Midway]], 4 June 1942, while some survivors suggest that she was scuttled by destroyer [[Hagikaze]]. The two squadrons from Enterprise were supposed to attack Akagi and Kaga; however due to a communication error, they both attacked Kaga while only 3 broke off to bomb Akagi.
*Her damaged CG shows a similar [http://www.midway42.org/TheBattle/Images/Kaga-Bomb-Hits.png hit] to the one that her real-life counterpart suffered.
*Piece of wreckage located in September 1999 was identified as belonging to Kaga in February 2000. It consists of an AA gun tub and a landing light array.
*The main wreck of Kaga was located by RV ''Petrel'' on 18 October 2019. She sits upright in over 17,000 feet of water, with most of her flight deck missing.
<!--*Her side ponytail is an allusion to the downward-facing funnel fitted on her as part of her 1936 refit.{{Cite}}--->
*Originally designed as a [[wikipedia:Tosa-class_battleship|''Tosa-class'' Battleship]], she was converted into a carrier after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1921.
*On 27th August 2015, her namesake was passed down to a newly-launched Izumo-class Helicopter Carrier (DDH-184) in the JMSDF in 2015. To commemorate her launching, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSHoAcJrjXU Kagamisaki] could be played on the jukebox free of charge until the end of Summer 2015 Event.
**Kaga depicted in her modern JMSDF form became a popular topic of illustrations among fans, and remains so, swapping her airplanes with helicopters, and her regular bow with modern equivalents, such as a scoped composite bow, while her attire largely remained the same, with a few modifications.
**The Kancolle likeness of Kaga, along with Inazuma and Suzutsuki appears to have been made into mascots of their namesakes by their crews, seen in various visual guides inside the ships. This was seen in their Southeast Asian Deployment billboards where the trio visited Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines, among others.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/warshipGF/photos/a.1665808446975791/2318328308390465/?type=3&permPage=1</ref>
