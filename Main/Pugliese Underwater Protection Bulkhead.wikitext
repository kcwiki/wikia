The Pugliese Underwater Protection Bulkhead is a cylindrical bulkhead intended to increase underwater protection of large warships. Even with the results at Taranto, a certain degree of effectiveness is still expected from these bulkheads. (Can be mounted on battleships, battlecruisers, aviation battleships, and aircraft carriers (including armored carriers).)

The Pugliese Underwater Protection system, named after its designer Umberto Pugliese, was intended to reduce the effectiveness of torpedo strikes through the use of a hollow steel drum that ran along the length of the underwater bulkhead. In theory, any incoming torpedoes would collapse the drum, expending its blast energy in the process and thus reducing the damage dealt. In practice however, the effectiveness of this device when compared to more traditional systems was questionable. While it could (and did) stop torpedoes under favorable conditions, it had several drawbacks and a weakness to non-direct hits, which made its value in combat limited.
