|Library = イタリア海軍マエストラーレ級駆逐艦の次女、グレカーレよ。なあに？あんまりジロジロ見ないでよ。姉妹たちとの第10駆逐隊でけっこう頑張ったのよ。みんな逝ってしまったけれど、あたしは戦い抜けた。そして、戦いの後も海の護りについたの。主武装を撤去した司令艦として。覚えておいて。
|Library/En = I'm the 2nd of the Italian Navy's Maestrale-class destroyers, Grecale. What? Don't keep staring at me. I worked hard with my sisters in the 10th Destroyer Division. Everyone else was gone in the end but I survived the war. After the war, I continued to protect the seas. I was even disarmed to serve as the command ship. Make sure you remember me.
