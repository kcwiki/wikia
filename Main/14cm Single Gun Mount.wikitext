The mid-range gun intended for cruisers' main gun and also battleships' secondary gun.<br/>A bit old-fashioned but still retains same range and firepower compared to 15 cm guns of overseas.<br/>Designated for anti-surface combat, so anti-air firing is not possible.

Used as Japanese post-Tenryuu class light cruisers' main armament, as well as battleships' secondary gun on Ise class and Nagato class. The original secondary battleship gun was calibrated at [[15.2cm Single Gun Mount|15.2 cm]] but the shell weighing more than 40 kg was rather too heavy to be handled by hand, so came the smaller caliber 14 cm gun. The momentum of shell itself decreased slightly but the range remained same and it also had increased firing rate at a maximum of 10 rounds/min. The fleet's food supply ship, Mamiya was also equipped with this gun. Also a [[14cm Twin Gun Mount|twin-mount version]] existed and was used by Yuubari and the Katori-class.
