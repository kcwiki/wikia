==Character==
===Appearance===
* I-19 wears a school swimsuit with a name tag on it. Other equipment includes a cannon on her right thigh and several torpedoes around her. She has long blue hair in [http://i.imgur.com/dp7xz8B.jpg triple-tails], secured with white ribbons and tiny ship parts. She also has red eyes with [https://img.moegirl.org/common/3/36/伊19面部高清立绘.jpg cherry blossom-shaped pupils].

* She is very often seen holding her torpedos in a way that it goes below her breasts.
===Personality===
*I-19 is laid back and carefree and loves her torpedoes. She likes her Admiral as "(s)he does not get mad no matter whatever she does", and proclaims herself ''Sniper of the Ocean'' [[#Trivia|for good reason]].
*Like many other ships, she has a vocal tic; hers being "なの" (Nano) or some variation of it.

==Trivia==
*Calls herself as "Iku". The "i" is a way to read the 1 in Japanese along with the "ku" as a way to read the 9.
*In September 15, 1942, while patrolling the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands ''Solomon Islands''], she spotted and fired a spread of 6 torpedoes at the carrier [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wasp_(CV-7) ''USS Wasp'']''.'' 3 torpedeos hit the carrier, causing such heavy damage that she later needed to be scuttled. The other 3 torpedoes (by sheer luck) sank the destroyer [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_O%27Brien_(DD-415) ''USS O'Brien''] and caused significant damage to the battleship [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_North_Carolina_(BB-55) ''USS North Carolina'']. 
**As a result of this, she holds the record for the most number of ships hit by a single torpedo spread fired by any submarine during World War II, and one of the most damaging overall.
*She is a distant cousin of [[I-58]], both were Type-B Submarines.
**I-19 was a I-15 class submarine, which was the name of the original Type B design. They were the fastest submarine on surface at that time (underwater, that honor goes to the I-200 class)
*Sunk via depth charges on November 25, 1943 by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Radford_(DD-446) USS ''Radford''].
