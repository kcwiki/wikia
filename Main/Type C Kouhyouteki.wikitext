{{Equipment

|en = A late model of the domestically produced "Special Midget Submarine". An enlarged Type A with a diesel turbine that makes it better than the Type B. It can be operated from midget sub tenders, a new model seaplane tender or submarines. It was originally meant to be an offensive support weapon during the decisive battle, but it was used as a defensive weapon in the latter stages of the war; the units fought bravely over many sorties.
