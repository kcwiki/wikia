==Map Guide==
*'''This map does not allow the use of (F)BB(V) and CV(L/B).'''
**You can place a BB or CV on your 1st fleet to avoid mistakenly sorting it.
*'''NOTE''': It is possible to sortie either the First Fleet, or the [[Striking Force]] Fleet (3rd Fleet) in this map.
*'''LBAS''': Two [[Land Base Aerial Support]]s are available for sorties. Enemy's air raid is present.
** 2+ range is required in order to reach the first boss node {{Event/Route|L|red}} and 6+ for the 2nd {{Event/Route|T|red}}

===Historical Fleet: Battle of Ormoc Bay===
The historical fleet that has participated in Operation Ta-gō Kai.
* CA: {{ShipLink|Ashigara Kai Ni|text=Ashigara}}, {{ShipLink|Nachi Kai Ni|text=Nachi}}

==Phases==
#Completely Deplete the Transport Gauge to unlock the Boss Node {{Event/Route|T|red}}.
#*Depending on difficulty selected, you must also:
#**For Hard difficulty, achieve both Air Superiority from Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}} as well as from an Enemy Air Raid on your [[Land Base Aerial Support|LBAS]].
#**For Normal/Medium difficulty, achieve minimum Air Parity at Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}}, but Air Superiority during [[Land Base Aerial Support|LBAS]] raid.
#**For Easy difficulty, only Air Parity is required for Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}}. 
#Sink the {{ShipLink|Heavy Cruiser Princess}} and her combined fleet.

===Depleting the Transport Gauge===
[[File:Winter 2018 Event E-5 Hard Transport Phase|right|250 px]]
*'''Recommended: Strike Force (3rd Fleet)'''
*You must fully clear the TP Gauge Bar for this phase.
**Like any other Transport Operation, you must obtain at least a minimum of A-Rank Victory to deplete the TP Gauge Bar. Refer to [[Events/Mechanics#Map-specific_Mechanics|Transport Loadoff]] for more information regarding the mechanic.
*Using a certain number of [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:631528#The_Second_Striking_Force_.28Shima_Fleet.29%7C Shima Fleet], ≥2/3/5 on Easy/Medium/Hard, it can route you through {{Event/Route|C|lightblue|D|orange|E|lightblue|G|Green|F|orange|H|red|I|green|J|red|L|red}} for the shortest path.
**NOTE: Abukuma is NOT a member of the Shima Fleet
*Possible Composition: 1-2 CL + 2 CA(V) + 2-4 DD + 0-1 {{ShipLink|Akitsu Maru/Kai}}
**You may use {{ShipLink|Akitsu Maru/Kai}}, and/or multiple {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai|text=Seaplane Fighters}} on a CAV to obtain AS. However, it is also possible to fight without Air Power by utilizing [[Equipment_Guide|a setup for non-Artillery Spotting (no AS) situation]], though you still might be required to use Recon plane(s) to satisfy the LoS requirement.
*'''NOTE:''' {{EquipmentLink|Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank}} depletes a bonus 20 TP from the TP bar for this map. It is recommended that you bring it, if available.
*Because of the Short Range required by the LBAS to reach the boss node, it is recommended to send all of your LBAS into it to have a good chance in obtaining at least an A-rank victory.
**However, sending one of your bases full of interceptors/fighters to the Enemy Air Raid Nodes {{Event/Route|D|orange}} and {{Event/Route|F|orange}} can help make reaching the boss node easier.
***Alternatively you can send them both to the Air-Raid nodes (4 and 2 range) in lower difficulties and have them deal with those if your fleet is strong enough to obtain A- or S-Rank at the boss node without support.
**You may also consider the option to use the Support Expedition Fleet for the Boss Node.

===Unlocking the Boss Node===
[[File:Winter 2018 Event E-5 Opening Route to Boss|right|250 px]]
*Just depleting the Transport Gauge will not be enough to open up the Boss Node {{Event/Route|T|red}}.
**Depending on difficulty selected, you must also:
***For Hard difficulty, achieve both Air Superiority from Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}} as well as from an Enemy Air Raid on your [[Land Base Aerial Support|LBAS]].
***For Normal/Medium difficulty, achieve minimum Air Parity at Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}}, but Air Superiority during [[Land Base Aerial Support|LBAS]] raid.
***For Easy difficulty, only Air Parity is required for Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}}. 
====Obtaining Air Superiority/Parity in Node D====
*To obtain Air Superiority (Hard-Only) or Air Parity in (Easy/Medium) from {{Event/Route|D|orange}}, you are recommended to bring CAV(s) (or Italian CA(s) such as {{ShipLink|Pola}} or {{ShipLink|Zara/Due|text=Zara}} with multiple {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai|text=Seaplane Fighters}}, and/or {{ShipLink|Akitsu Maru/Kai}} with [[List of Fighters by stats|Fighters]], and have all of your LBAS fully equipped with [[List of Land-based Fighters by stats|Land-based Fighters]] or [[List of Fighters by stats|Carrier-based Fighters]] and sent to Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}}.
**Another option for your LBAS is to equip them with both {{EquipmentLink|Type 1 Land-based Attack Aircraft|text=Land-based Attack Aircrafts}} and [[List of Land-based Fighters by stats|Land-based Fighters]]/[[List of Fighters by stats|Carrier-based Fighters]] and sent to Node {{Event/Route|D|orange}}, where the Bombers will sink the Enemy Carriers, where they will become unable to participate in the Aerial Battle Phase.
***However as there are chances that the Enemy Carrier(s) may not be sunk from this attack, this option is slightly risky to use.

===Defeating the Heavy Cruiser Princess===
[[File:Winter 2018 Event E-5 Hard Final Kill|thumb|right|250 px]]
*You are to use the '''Striking Force Fleet (3rd Fleet)''' for this Phase.
**Recommended Composition: 2 CA(V) 1 CL 4 DD
***Route: {{Event/Route|O|orange|N|red|P|red|T|red}}
****Please note that to avoid routing from O to R, having 4 Destroyers in the fleet is '''Mandatory'''.
****Due to this fact, use of {{EquipmentLink|Striking Force Fleet Command Facility}} to retreat a Destroyer on node O is discouraged, as having even one of them retreated will cause your fleet to go through the extra node R before the boss node.
*To pass through the Route with a safer chance, you are highly recommended to continue to use the Vanguard Formation all the way until your fleet reaches the Boss Node.
*You are recommended to bring at least 1 CAV fully equipped with multiple {{EquipmentLink|Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai|text=Seaplane Fighters}}.
**Unfortunately due to the extremely high Air Power requirements in Nodes {{Event/Route|O|orange}} and {{Event/Route|N|red}}, you will most likely have to deal with getting <span style="color:red">Air Denial</span>, or at worse <span style="color:red">Air Incapability ('''制空権喪失!''')</span> if lacking in Seaplane Fighters or just outright not using any at all.
***Although you may choose to use your [[Land Base Aerial Support|LBAS]] with Fighters to reduce the Air Power of the Enemy Fleet, this will mean you will have less support at the Boss Node.
**You are highly recommended to bring at least 1-2 Ship capable of using Anti-Air Cut-In.
*Node {{Event/Route|P|red}} has an Enemy Fleet Pattern which contains a {{ShipLink|Submarine So-Class}}. This will cause your Destroyer/Light Cruisers to be forced to attack it, making them unable to take out the other enemies.
**You are recommended to bring at least 1 OASW capable Destroyer or Light Cruiser to get rid of it immediately.
*To fight against the Boss Fleet more easily, you are recommended to send both of your LBAS with 3 {{EquipmentLink|Type 1 Land-based Attack Aircraft|text=Land-based Attack Aircrafts}} and 1 Fighter each to the Boss Node.
**Use of Support Expedition is not required for Pre-Finals, but you may wish to consider it for the Final Kill in the Boss Node.
