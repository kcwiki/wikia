==Trivia==
* Named after the [[wikipedia:Katori_Shrine|Shinto Katori Shrine]] in [[wikipedia:Chiba_prefecture|Chiba prefecture, Japan]].
** That name was first carried by the leader of the Katori class pre-dreadnought battleships in 1906.
** Her name was passed down to the first training ship of the Maritime Self Defense Force in 1969. Training ship JDS Katori (TV-3501) sailed around the world, raised a number of officers over 25 years in a peaceful era, and was retired full of happiness in 1998. Kashima soon followed as a modern JMSDF training ship, continuing Katori's work.
* A training ship from commissioning on April 20th, 1940 to sometime before November 11th, 1941.
* A combat ship from sometime before November 11th, 1941 until sinking in 1944.
* Sunk in a joint attack between the USN ships ''[[Iowa]]'' and ''New Jersey'' during [[wikipedia:Operation_Hailstone|''Operation Hailstone'']] on February 19th, 1944 off [[wikipedia:Chuuk_Lagoon|Truk]] ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Katori&params=07_45_N_151_20_E_ 07°45′N 151°20′E﻿]).
** On the morning of February 17th, 1944, she led a small fleet, including [[Maikaze]] & [[Nowaki]], from Truk in a breakout attempt towards Yokosuka, Japan. They were subjected to air attacks before facing a superior surface force. Only Nowaki escaped.
** Iowa barraged Katori with 5 & 16-inch salvos, sinking her in 13 minutes, sunk with all hands lost.
* A damaged Katori was [http://www.cv6.org/1944/truk/default.htm personally spared] from further air attack by ADM Mitscher so that ADM Spruance's battleships could be brought up for live target practice. 
**A training cruiser to the very end.
