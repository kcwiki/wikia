{{ShipQuotes
|Introduction = 軽空母、龍驤や。独特なシルエットでしょ？でも、艦載機を次々繰り出す、ちゃーんとした空母なんや。期待してや！
|Introduction/En = Light aircraft carrier, Ryuujou! Ain't my silhouette distinctive? But, launching carrier planes one-after-another makes me a proper carrier, ya know! You can count on me!
|Introduction/Note = RJ had no island and her bridge was under the carrier deck; she was totally flat on top. The shape of her bridge gave her a unique appearance, reflected in-game by her cap.

|Library = 軽空母だけど、結構歴戦の空母なんよ、うち。<br>ああ、あの岩手沖での第四艦隊事件のこと？あれはきつかったー<br>波浪で艦橋圧壊…いや、ホントありえへん。
|Library/En = I'm a light aircraft carrier, but with a long record, ya' know? <br>Oh, that Fourth Fleet incident thing, off Iwate? That was tough.<br>The waves made my bridge collapse... Man, I just couldn't believe it.
