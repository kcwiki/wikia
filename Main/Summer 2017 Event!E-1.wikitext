==Map Guide==
*'''This map does not allow the use of (F)BB, CV(B). BBVs and CVLs are fine, however.'''


* Node E and node N are submarine nodes.
* Node Q, node R and node S are hidden nodes:
** to unlock node Q, you need to reach the anchor node M once.
** to unlock node R and node S, you need to reach the anchor node Q once. Use a torpedo squadron (ex. 1 CAV 2 CL 3 DD to reach node Q).
*'''Note''': To farm node S where Sagiri resides, you will need at least 8 ships if you want to unlock the route to node S; 6 originally and 2 to replace your BBV and CVL later on to form a fast fleet. Please note that Sagiri also drops in E-2.
* The LoS requirement to reach the boss node P is estimated to be at least 24 using the F33 Cn1 formula.
*Going Northwest route (F-E-C-P) is not recommended even on easy due to the presence of {{ShipLink|Light Carrier Nu-Class/Kai Flagship}} in Node C and having 3 battle nodes compared to 2 in South route (I-J-G-D-P).
**SS(V) will force northwest route so they are not recommended at all.
*The Boss is {{ShipLink|New Submarine Princess/Flagship|text=New Submarine Princess}}. It is recommended to bring OASW capable ships like DDs or CLs.
**Boss node has also a light carrier; don't forget to bring some fighters on your CVL. In hard, Nu-class Kai Elite can show up pre-LD, but in LD, it will be Kai Flagship.

==Possible Fleet Composition== 
*{{Event/Route|I|blue|J|blue|G|red|D|red|P|red}}: 
**1 CVL 1 BBV 2 DD/DE + 2 DD/DE/CL
**1 CVL 1 BBV 2 DD/DE 1 CLT  + 1 DD/DE/CL
*'''Note: You can only bring a maximum of 1 CLT, bringing more will make you route to F instead of I.'''

==Node S (Sagiri) Farming==
{{Section|no_clear=true}}{{clear}}
*'''Equipping {{GreenGunMG}}, {{GreenGunDP}}, {{RedGunLight}}, {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Lookouts}} and/or {{YellowGun}} will give extra accuracy bonuses against  {{ShipLink|PT Imp Pack}}.'''
**Currently, {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Lookouts}} can be obtained from {{ShipLink|Takanami Kai}} and {{ShipLink|Kazagumo Kai}} (also Choukai, but needs Blueprint). Both drop in E-4 and E-6. Consider lvling them to Kai before removing them from your fleet.
**There appears to be synergy bonuses between different kinds of equipment, but stacking multiple guns seems to also work.
**For all ships except Destroyers, {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Lookouts}} are required to trigger synergy.
**Skilled Lookouts appear to give the highest bonus when in combination with {{GreenGunMG}}.
**The most effective combination seems to be {{GreenGunMG}}, {{EquipmentLink|Skilled Lookouts}}, and one of {{YellowGun}} {{GreenGunDP}} {{RedGunLight}}, which can reach 99% accuracy fairly reliably.
***Ship girls with expansion slots can equip two guns for night battle DA and more firepower, or LoS equipment for routing.
*During Night battle, the <u>bonus accuracy doesn't seem to apply</u>. Logically speaking, it is '''best to defeat all PT Imps before Night Battle'''. They can be hit during Night Battle, but it will require more luck.
*Due to the equipment slot demands, most fleets will need either one AV, CVL, or BBV to compensate for the low LoS of the rest of the fleet.
**For Node N → O/R, the lowest LoS (according to F33 formula, read [[Line_of_Sight|here]]) that route to R '''eLoS ≥ 10.7''', below eLoS = 10.1 will route to O. Between 10.1 and 10.7 was not tested and should be approached with caution.
**For Node L → N/R, the lowest LoS tested is '''eLoS = 15.6'''. Below this was not tested yet.
===Formation Recommendations===
*Node L = Line Ahead
*Node N = Line Abreast
*Node R and S = Double Line (for accuracy increase)
===Fleet Composition===
*{{Event/Route|I|blue|J|blue|L|red|N|red|R|red|S|red}}
**1 BBV + 2-5 DD + 0-3 CL (at least 2 DD are needed to go to Node I)
This fleet is highly recommended due to multiple reasons:
*Most admirals will already invest at least 2-3 DD and 1-2 CL here along with a BBV and CVL.
*'''This allows for 2nd shelling''', which is crucial to avoiding letting enemies survive day battle until closing torpedoes.
*In addition, BBV can provide LoS needed with enough seaplanes. At least 3 seaplanes are needed. These can also help with clearing out surface enemies during opening phases.
*One of the DD/CL '''is recommended to be able to perform OASW''', so that the submarines in node N can be sunk consistently before closing torpedoes. [[Isuzu Kai Ni]] is a good option due to her light OASW requirements.
