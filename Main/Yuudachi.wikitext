{{Ship/Quotes
|Introduction = こんにちは。白露型駆逐艦、夕立よ！よろしくね！
|Introduction/En = Hi, I'm Yuudachi, a Shiratsuyu-class destroyer.  Nice to meet you!

|Introduction/Kai = 白露型駆逐艦、夕立。今日も頑張るぽい！ぽーい！
|Introduction/Kai/En = I'm Yuudachi, a Shiratsuyu-class destroyer. Let's like, do our best today! Poooi!

|Library = 白露型駆逐艦の４番艦、夕立です。<br>第三次ソロモン海戦では、けっこう頑張ったっぽい？<br>でも、何気に「アイアンボトム・サウンド」って、ホントに怖い言葉よね？
|Library/En = I'm Yuudachi, the fourth ship of the Shiratsuyu class.<br>I worked sort of hardish during the Third Battle of the Solomons didn't I?<br>But somehow... the term "Iron Bottom Sound" is really scary, isn't it?
|Library/Note = Yuudachi led the battle line to bombard Guadalcanal on 12 November; she took a lot of damage and [[Samidare]] rescued most of her crew.  USS Portland later sank her off Savo Island - right in the "Ironbottom Sound".<br>About her verbal tic 'っぽい' (ppoi), this is added onto the end of a word to signify a comparison or resemblance rather than the 'valley girl' version of like which is more like a verbal comma. For example kodomoppoi would mean something similar to child-like or childish.

|Minor Damage 2/Kai Ni = ハンモックを張ってでも、戦うよ！

|Minor Damage 2/Kai Ni/Note = In the third battle of Solomon, captain Kikkawa ordered his men to 'raise the sails' using hammocks to keep up the morale after Yuudachi's engine was disabled; this act angered the Americans as it appeared Yuudachi continued fighting while hanging the 'white flag'. The sail is visible on the second remodel art.

==Character==
===Appearance===
*Yuudachi wears a black serafuku shared with the first four ship girls of her class. She has straight long blonde hair with a hair ribbon on top and green eyes.
====Second Remodel====
*Yuudachi's second remodel reflects her accomplishments in the Guadalcanal Campaign, where she assisted in sinking two converted transports and later damaging a cruiser before being sunk herself.
<!--USS Gregory and USS Little were CONVERTED TRANSPORTS when they were sunk. This is clearly shown in USN records.-->
*She bears the title 'Nightmare of Solomon' for reasons explained [http://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/2xbiok/can_someone_explain_yuudachi_and_the_nightmare_of here].
<!--There is incorrect information in the explanation.
1: Callaghan's delay in opening fire actually allowed Abe the time he needed to swap to AP rounds. This is reflected in the hits sustained in the USN battle reports.
2: The USN line became disorganized more so from Admiral Callaghan's inaction, the lack of information on the USS San Francisco's bridge, and a breakdown in communication amongst the USN battle line, than Yudachi, which actually turned away from the battle at the onset, and then returned near the end. Commander Kikkawa Kiyoshi admitted in his memoirs that he was overly cautious during the battle, as he had recollections of the Battle of Badung Strait where (as then-CO of Ooshio) he had mistakenly fired on Asashio.
3: Calling the USS Gregory and USS Little destroyers at that point in time is quite the stretch, as they had their armament removed when they were converted to transports, and reassigned to TransDiv 12. The issue is that the IJN was not aware of this, and thus not reflected in their accounts.
Sidenote: Kiyoshi had already been promoted to commander by the time of the battle.-->
*Her hair becomes messy, gaining a hair clip on the left side, and her eye-color changes dramatically to red. Her artist tweeted that the "flaps" on her hair was to reflect her "ferocious hound (狂犬)"-like history during her final battle. Compare with [[Shigure]].
*She acquires a white scarf and a sail with a white flag attached.
*Furthermore, her firepower is comparable to that of most [[:Category:Heavy_Cruisers|Heavy Cruisers]].

===Personality===
*She exhibits carefree behavior, fortified by her frequent use of "っぽい" (Poi) which can come off as very casual.
*After her second remodel, she becomes very pugnacious.

==Original ship==
* Sunk 13 November 1942 off [[wikipedia:Savo_Island|Savo Island]] ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Y%C5%ABdachi&params=09_14_S_159_52_E_ 09°14′S 159°52′E]).
* The wreck was discovered in 1992 by [[wikipedia:Robert_Ballard|Dr. Robert Ballard]].
* Her wreck is around [http://ict.sopac.org/VirLib/TR0280.pdf 800 m] below the surface.
* Claimed assisted kills on [[wikipedia:USS_Gregory_(DD-82)|USS Gregory]] and [[wikipedia:USS_Little_(DD-79)|USS Little]].
* Yuudachi was in fact sunk by US forces [[wikipedia:USS_Portland_(CA-33)|(USS Portland)]] despite failed attempts to scuttle her.

==Appearances in derivative works==
[[File:Yuudachi-anime.png|thumb|right|140px]]
* Yuudachi appears in the [[Anime|anime adaptation]] of Kantai Collection as a part of Torpedo Squad 3, alongside the [[:Category:Sendai Class|Sendai sisters]] and [[Mutsuki]]. She helps welcome [[Fubuki]] to shared quarters with Mutsuki.
* As of episode 9 of the animated series (Second Remodel, Poi!), Yuudachi received a [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Remodelling Remodel] explaining a little about its process.

==Trivia==
* Her name means "sudden evening shower".
** It was first carried by the sixteenth Torpedo Boat Destroyer of the First Kamikaze class in 1906.
** It is now currently carried by a JMSDF Murasame-class destroyer.
* Received her Kai Ni on October 16, 2013.
* Yuudachi's white sail was incorrectly seen as a flag of surrender, a fact that angered the Americans when she kept on fighting despite raising it. This sail can be seen in her Kai Ni artwork, and reflects the significance.
* ~poi in Japanese means "maybe", "perhaps" or "seems like", something added to the end of a sentence if the speaker isn't too sure of the result and end up concluding the sentence by guessing. The main reason behind Yuudachi's speech pattern is because no one actually had a clear record of what she actually accomplished in the Guadalcanal Campaign. Even though Yuudachi did wreak havoc in the battle, there are other ships who also claimed the kills. Since her battle records were unclear and involved a lot of guesswork from naval historians from both sides after the war, the game version of Yuudachi landed with the "poi" catchphrase just to reflect that little piece of history. (Yuudachi's library introduction line implies that she wasn't so sure of her own battle result in Guadalcanal, either.)
