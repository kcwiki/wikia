|Introduction = Buon Giorno～。ザラ級重巡の三番艦～、ポーラです～。何にでも挑戦したいお年頃。頑張ります～。
|Introduction/En = Buon Giorno. I'm the third ship of the Zara-Class heavy cruiser, Pola. I'm at an age where I want to challenge myself with everything. I'll do my best.
|Introduction/Note = The motto of Pola "The age where I want to challenge everything" (Italian "ARDISCO AD OGNI IMPRESA", lit. "I dare any venture" in English) was written on her X turret. The in-game Pola actually features the same motto on her CG, too, but it is not noticed by many as the motto was written in quite tiny letters.

|Introduction/Kai = Buon Giorno～！ザラ級重巡三番艦～、ポーラです～。提督といっしょに何でも挑戦中で～す。頑張ります。

|Library/En = I'm the third ship of the Zara-Class heavy cruiser, Pola. Everyone, be sure to remember me. I'm an excellent heavy cruiser focused on armor and defense. I properly participated in surface combat, but I wasn't able to defeat battleships. I can only drink it away.
|Library/Note = The Zara-class cruisers boasted an excellent armor protection. Pola engaged enemy cruisers in the Battles of Cape Sparivento and Cape Matapan.<br>Crippled at Cape Matapan, she stood by helplessly as her sisters were destroyed by Royal Navy battleships. A number of crew members, having hurriedly jumped overboard and later reboarded the ship, drank the ship's liquor stocks in an attempt to warm themselves and became drunk.

==Character==

===Personality===
*Is a drunkard, loves to drink red wine, and sometimes tends to get naked while drunk.

=== Appearance ===
* She is depicted as having gray wavy hair, grayish brown eyes, and thick eyebrows. She also wears a uniform similar to big sister Zara's. Pola wears a black corset over a white shirt, a red miniskirt with anchors attached, white thighhighs and grey boots. Accessories include a red bowtie and a mini hat based on the appearance of the historical Pola's rangefinder. Her damaged portrait features her leaning topless on her gear with several articles of clothing removed (this refers to her demise, as explained below).
* For a collaboration with Mitsukoshi with a promotional release of a new batch of Beaujolais Nouveau for the Fall 2016 Event (which also foreshadowed Commandant Teste's appearence in the same event), she is drawn wearing a white coat, a pink scarf, black pantyhose, black boots and black gloves along with a fur trim for her hat. She is sparkling while staring at the glass of wine she is holding, and carrying a Mitsukoshi bag. Her damaged portrait is simply her with the coat and scarf removed, empty glass in hand, no visible damage, revealing she had been wearing her usual clothes underneath.

==Notes==
*Enables construction of [[Zara]] in [[Construction|Large Ship Construction]] when set as flagship.

=== Trivia ===
* Named after the city of Pola (today [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pula Pula], in Croatia). The city has been under the authority of Republic of Venice a few times, with the longest being from 1331 to 1797, and was part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1918 to 1947.
* Crippled by aerial torpedo dropped by a Swordfish bi-plane torpedo bomber from HMS Formidable during the Battle of Cape Matapan.
* Sunk by HMS [[Jervis]] after the surviving crew was removed by said destroyer the following night. The boarding party from Jervis found some crew members drunk and, according to legends, "empty bottles littered across the deck" (though such details are largely the result of postwar exaggeration). The episode was greatly exploited by British propaganda at the time.
* When she was implemented a bug affected her equipment so that she couldn't re-equip her Kai's Ro.44 Seaplane Fighter. The bug [http://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/731044365280280576 was fixed] with an offline maintenance on May the 5th, 2016.
* Her introduction line, "I'm at an age where I want to challenge myself with everything", likely refers to the unit's motto "[http://www.trentoincina.it/images/002901.jpg Ardisco ad ogni impresa]" ("I dare any venture") that, like for the other units of the class, was written on the side of one of the turrets (the turret was different from unit to unit, it was the X turret for Pola, and the Y turret for Zara's "[http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara_(incrociatore)#/media/File:Artiglierie_zara.jpg Tenacemente"], tenaciously).
