|trivia = Introduced alongside the Mk.II, the Mk.III was modified specifically for ASW use after its withdraw as a torpedo bomber. Its slow speed was a perfect candidate for submarine hunting and the nature of a biplane configuration allowed it to carry very heavy equipment like the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Light Leigh Light] and ASV Mk.X Radar (also known as Mk.XI). If an Mk.III was equipped with the radar, it was impossible to also use a mine or depth charge because the large radar occupied the space, so the rockets had to be used, which were more than enough to sink a U-boat. This is the configuration that is depicted in the game, but in the squadrons, one plane may have focused on ASW with the mine and rockets while another one spotting and tracking with the radar and searchlight.
* Because of its versatility, it earned the nickname "Stringbag".
* In good sea conditions, the ASV Mk.X could detect even a U-boat snorkel.
* In total, the Swordfish managed to sink 22 U-boats.
