General Notes:
*Aviation Cruisers are heavy cruiser sized vessels equipped to carry seaplanes. They are also known as ''Aircraft Cruisers''.
**Aviation cruisers can launch [[List of Seaplanes by stats|Seaplane Bombers]] allowing them to participate in aerial combat phase and grant them the ability to attack submarines.
***The ability to participate in ASW is not always advantageous.
**Unlike Aviation battleships, their '''max firepower is not reduced''' after the remodel. Their default firepower after remodel is, however, a lot lower than the average heavy cruiser's.
*Aviation Cruisers have higher fuel consumption but lower ammo consumption than heavy cruisers.
*Aviation Cruisers '''can equip [[Drum Canister|drum canisters]] ''' while heavy cruisers can't.
*Every Mogami Class Aviation Cruisers come with a [[Zuiun]] as their default equipment.
**Mikuma Kai gives an uncraftable [[20.3cm(no.3) Twin Gun Mount]].
*Tone Class Aviation Cruisers come with an uncraftable [[20.3cm(no.3) Twin Gun Mount]] and [[Zuiun (634 Air Group)]].
*Tone Class Aviation Cruisers (Kai Ni) have the highest LoS stat [[file:icon_LOS.png|View Range]] in game.
