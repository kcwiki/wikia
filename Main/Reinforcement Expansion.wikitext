==Introduction==
The Reinforcement Expansion is a consumable item added alongside the [[Summer 2015 Event]] that allows you to reinforce a ship to '''permanently''' add an additional utility equipment slot. For example, you can equip a reinforced ship with {{EquipmentLink|Emergency Repair Personnel|Emergency Repair Goddess|text=damecons}} without compromising their equipment loadout.
*Your Kanmusu must be '''at least Level 30''' to install a Reinforcement Expansion. 
*'''The additional equipment slot given by a Reinforcement Expansion will remain with the ship permanently; remodels will not remove it.'''.

*Reinforcement Expansions can be obtained through either [[#Acquisition (Through Gameplay)|normal gameplay]],Â such as events and quests, or the [[Shop|cash shop]] for 500 DMM points.

==Allowed Equipment==
Only certain pieces of equipment can be placed inside the additional slot given by a Reinforcement Expansion; the equipment allowed is dependent on the ship that was given the extra slot. Equipment placed inside this slot functions as if it were placed in a normal equipment slot.
