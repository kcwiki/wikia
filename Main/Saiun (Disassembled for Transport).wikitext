"No Grumman could catch us" was the famous telegraph sent from this reconnaissance aircraft, "Saiun". This reconnaissance aircraft boasts high-speed performance no enemy fighter can overtake. As the war deteriorated, this aircraft monitored enemy movements at sea. This "Saiun" has been dismantled so it could be transported by being stored in the hangar of an Aircraft Carrying Submarine.
