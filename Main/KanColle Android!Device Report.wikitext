This page include players report on devices that can run the kancolle Android client.
==Interrim Summary==
According to reports contributed by users below and on other sites, it appears that
* The game can run on almost any device with Android 4.0 or above
* Device with higher resolution, for instance, 2K screen, can lead to laggy expericence. It can be countered by using apps like [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.gametuner.thin&hl=en Game Tuner] to reduce the rendering resolution for the app.
* No clear sign in which company's cpu/gpu being superior to others'.
* Enable the "Force GPU Rendering" option in your device's setting menu → developer setting appears to help increase the performance in most of the cases. "Force 4x MSAA" and "Disable HW overlays" also seems help.
* According to a few reports from those who tested multiple smartphones, it have been reported that experience on Samsung phones, even S7 Edge, are not as smooth compare to phones from other brands.
* Although it can run on device with down to 512MB RAM, but having at least 2GB RAM seems to help.
