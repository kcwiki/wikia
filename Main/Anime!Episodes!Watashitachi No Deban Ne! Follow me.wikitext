==Strategy== <!-- Detailed events -->
The day after Operation FS, the [[Anime/Characters#Nagato|Secretary Ship]] with her [[Anime/Characters#Mutsu|aide]] discuss the prior engagement & plan for the next one in the southwest sea zone.

Elsewhere, destroyer classes for the day have been ineffectual with [[Kisaragi]]'s loss. Everyone is treading delicately around [[Mutsuki]], whom is the only one acting normal. However, [[Shimakaze]] & [[Fubuki]] have been summoned for another mission.

Upon learning they've been temporarily assigned with [[Kongou]]'s fleet, Fubuki begins another idolization session. Unfortunately, the ideal shatters as Kongou charges in & proceeds to be herself, along with the rest of the [[:Category:Kongou_Class|Kongou class]].

The next day, before the mission can begin, a hunt for Shimakaze has to be undertaken as she's quite free-spirited. The first attempt is music, the second attempt is sweetness, & the third attempt is baiting, but the method that draws her is food.

The mission is finally underway & the battleships duke it out while the destroyers skirmish. However, a [[Enemy_Vessel|Ru-Class]] targets Fubuki, yet before one of the shells hit, [https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1917411 Kongou begs to differ]. The others buy time for Kongou to console Fubuki's heart & dispel the squall. Kongou & Shimakaze wrap things up.

Mutsuki, whom has been taking Kisaragi's loss poorly, is finally able to grieve with Fubuki utilizing what Kongou has shown her - a hug.
