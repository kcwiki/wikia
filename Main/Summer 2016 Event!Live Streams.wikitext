|Not frontlining, will start 2/3 days after the frontliners. Check my [https://www.facebook.com/anotherrandomanimepage Page] to see when i stream (will probably be around 4PM UTC+1 tho).
|Stream in both english and french (mainly french)

|Aquan
|[https://www.twitch.tv/Aq1_r4 Twitch]
|Main objective: Bring Taigei to every final kill of the event. Side Objective: Do it on hado modo. Extra side objective: Don't get salty this event (fat chance)
|Disgustingly slavic voice on mic, overabundance of Taigei on stream, 1stworldproblems and PJSalt. Also a custom-made bot.

|[[User:Mystia Lore.|Mystia Lore.]]
|[https://www.twitch.tv/mystialore Twitch]
|I have max resources everywhere so I want to try full Hard. Otherwise it gonna be a mix between Easy/Medium/Hard. Will start after having enough datas about the maps/drops/shiplock etc... .
|Stream in french. Can speak english if needed (But I prefer french, really). No voice because no mic, and no camera because I don't have any.
|-
|Depths
|[https://www.twitch.tv/the_depths Twitch]
|Might start on day 1 depending on the info that has been found, going to try a mix of easy/medium

|Only pure slav strats. Crazy russian is back on the track. Shot of vodka after each kill. Full hard. Few first maps - frontline.

|-
|SerialConvort
|[https://www.twitch.tv/serialconvort Twitch]
|Just the usual same all HARDO MODO frontline that I proclaim to be frontline but isn't since you can never really catch up with the Japanese frontliners, regardless, I will try my best and hope you join in my salt with Cam and Mic!
|Sub par mic and endless salt included with your side of bad mic lighting, all for the low low price of your time! (will skip first week of school to "frontline")
