Current Operation (plot summary episode ten on)
*	Due to a remodelling, the fleets are reorganized; however, the [[Anime/Characters#Abyssal Fleet|Abyssal Fleet]]	[[Anime/Episodes#Episode 9|strikes back]]
*	In search of the [[Anime/Episodes#Episode 10|Abyssal operational base ''AF'']], fleets are sent on reconnaissance
*	One goal is dealt with first with [[Anime/Episodes#Episode 11|Operations ''MI'' & ''AL'']]

<!-- *		[[Anime/Episodes#Episode 12|		]]  -->
*** Contains numerous references to actual Pacific War events & battles

CG
* Only on sea scenes
** Even then, certain shots are traditionally animated
*** Leads to frequent switching

Previews
* The title & its reading
* Kanmusu-related titles read by their [[Anime/Staff %26 Cast#Cast|seiyuu]]

All kanmusu & Abyssals are redesigned for the anime
* Probably for standardization purposes & ease of transfer into 3D
* [[Anime/Characters#Naval Base|Anime kanmusu]] & [[Anime/Characters#Abyssal Fleet|anime Abyssals]] versus [[Ship List (Image)|game kanmusu]] & [[Enemy Vessel|game Abyssals]]
* [https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1917133 Shibafu Akagi into anime Akagi]

Kanmusu quotes are frequently employed
* Possibility even when they do not quite fit

Time progression
* Timeskipping is evident, preventing derivations from day/night cycles & the script
* Travel times are skipped given the planning maps shown throughout the series
* Docking time, other than showing a few timers, is skipped
* Operation dates & times are not provided other than in a relative fashion

The series is split in half
* Odd episodes are serious
* Even episodes are usually character-focused

As is the usual practice, physics is bent as necessary for viewer expectations, dramatic effect, & so forth.

A ''Naval Base'' is within a ''Naval District''. For example, the [[wikipedia:Kure_Naval_District|Kure Naval District]]'s layout was:
* Naval Base
** Naval Guard Unit
** Naval Arsenal
** Naval Hospital
** Naval Prison
** Naval Fuel Depot
** Special Naval Landing Forces
* Submarine Base
* Naval Infantry Barracks
* Naval Fuel Depot
* Security Squadron
* Local Defence Squadron
* Naval Air Group
* Submarine Division

==Trivia==
Teitoku
* The Teitoku delegates many tasks to the Secretary Ship
** Usually has a scene or two per episode
* Scenes with the Teitoku are either from the Teitoku's perspective, or an angled shot to the visitors
* Only [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/File:Anime_episode_1_Teitoku.jpg their shadow] is seen

[[Anime/Characters#Nagato|Secretary Ship]]
* Has an [[Anime/Characters#Mutsu|aide]]
* Intermediary between the teitoku & kanmusu
* Has operational control
** Employs a [[Anime/Characters#Ooyodo|Communications Officer]]
** Communications between the naval base & operating fleets utilize morse code.

Arrows transmorgify in a yellow aura after shooting into aircraft
* Fairies are in the planes rather than on. It's possibly the same for equipment.
* As such, given the size of [http://anime yamato's fairy .jpg one of Yamato's fairies], it seems they vary in size or can change size.

The basic [[:Category:Kongou Class|''Kongou''-class]] armaments can fire in the [[Hiei/Gallery|X-form]] or [[Haruna/Gallery|compact form]].

Abyssal remodel is indeterminate unless noted

The Abyssal aircraft launch in a mini-form, then enlarge within a yellow aura

Abyssal shells are shown as cracked spheres.

Combat ranges are extremely close

The Naval Base has numerous fleets, but naturally, only the fleets [[Anime/Characters#Fubuki|Fubuki]] interacts with are ever seen deploying
* Even during base emergencies

A port is not necessary for departing or demounting equipment

[[Wikipedia:Beaching_(nautical)|Beaching]] does not exist
* Fully equiped kanmusu can walk on land & operate in shallow waters

There is no hospital - only the [[Docking|docks]]
