== Character ==

=== Appearance ===

=== Personality ===
* She is often paired with Maru-Yu, due to an anecdotal incident with some of the historic Maru-Yu-class sub's first dives. Kiso's crew apparently looked on in disbelief that the Maru-Yu even was a sub or could dive. Artists often treat Kiso as Maru-Yu's senpai and role model.

==Trivia==
*After being remodeled into a torpedo cruiser, just like Kitakami and Ooi, she can equip [[Type A Ko-hyoteki]] to fire opening torpedoes before shelling phase.
*Her 2nd Upgrade art camo is based on her historical duty while she, along with Tama, were assigned in the "Northern Waters" mostly patrolling the Kuril Islands.
*Sunk by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USN USN] aircraft off Manila Bay, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines Philippines] [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Kiso&params=14_35_N_120_50_E_ 14°35′N 120°50′E]. Her wreck site is close to Hatsuharu's and Okinami's. Historical confusion has led to a mistaken allegation that she was capsized at Cavite.
** Her wreckage, along with [[Hatsuharu]]'s, [[Akebono]]'s, [[Nachi]]'s, [[Okinami]]'s and [[Satsuki]]'s have been cleared from the site since the 50's. All of their wreck sites are close to what is now Engineer's Island, otherwise known as the Baseco Compound in Tondo, Manila and the Manila International Container Terminal, close to the delta of the Pasig River.
