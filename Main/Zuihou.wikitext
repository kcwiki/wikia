==Character==

===Appearance===
* Zuihou wears a white kimono top with sleeves visibly attached over a red one. The sleeves' brims are lattice trimming. For a bottom, she wears red pleated shorts. Like most of the archer carriers, she wears a muneate over her clothing.

* She has long light brown hair with a high ponytail. She wears a red-striped white hachimaki that also secures her hair. She wields a bow patterned like her hachimaki and arrows with planes attached to them.

'''''Upgrade'''''
* Similarly to [[Zuikaku]], her clothes changes color after her remodel. Her clothes become green and her muneate gains a geometric camouflage pattern.

=== Personality ===
* She tends to fawn to the commander with a sweet ring. The way she interacts with the commander tends to sound like a loving daughter happily conversing with her caring father. After marriage, she acts like a caring and loving housewife towards the admiral. For unknown reasons, she loves to cook ''tamagoyaki''.

==Notes==
*Zuihou Kai Ni B gains the following abilities upon remodel:
**Long Combat range and is the first light carrier to have more than medium range.
**Obtains ASW stats and is able to OASW Attack.
***Must have at least 65+ {{ASW}} stats to use OASW Attack.
***Must have a Torpedo Bomber, Anti-submarine Patrol Aircraft, or Autogyro with at least 7+ {{ASW}} stats to use OASW Attack.
** Can equip the [[Type 0 Passive Sonar]], though otherwise she cannot equip most other {{Sonar}} SONARs or {{DepthCharge}} Depth Charges.
**Able to join [[Combat/Combined Fleet|Transport Combined Fleet]]

==Trivia==
*Her name translates to "auspicious phoenix", as does [[Shouhou]]'s.
*The camo pattern on her remodel's clothing refer to the actual flight deck camouflage pattern used during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf Battle of Leyte Gulf], the same pattern was used on [[Zuikaku]], [[Chitose]], and [[Chiyoda]].
*She originally was laid down as the submarine tender / fleet oiler "''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Zuih%C5%8D Takasaki]"'', she was renamed and converted while under construction into an aircraft carrier by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Naval_Armaments_Supplement_Programme 2nd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme] with [[Shouhou]].
*Sunk by air attack during the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Enga%C3%B1o Battle of Cape Engaño], 25 October 1944.
