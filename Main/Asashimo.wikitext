== Character ==
===Appearance===
* She wears the standard Yuugumo-class school uniform which consists of a purple sleeveless dress over a white shirt, a teal-blue bowtie andgrey/purpleopaque pantyhose with lace-up boots. She wears her rigging on her back as a backpack, it has a single black strap. Quadruple torpedo launchers are strapped to her thighs and she wields a standard 12.7cm gun with her right hand.
* On remodel, she gains a white headband, AA guns and a single thighhigh on her left leg is overlaid on her pantyhose (emulating Yamato as an Operation Ten-Go participant). 
* She has long multicolored hair that is grey/silver on the outside and purple on the inside. The inside becomes a purple to blue gradient after remodel. Her hairstyle consists of a ponytail, hair covering her right eye, strands converging to her ponytail and a ahoge. At the very least, her left eye is grey. She is notable for having serrated teeth, similar to that of a shark.

=== Personality ===
* She has a boisterous personality. Resembles Kiyoshimo a great deal.

== Notes ==
*Asashimo Kai Ni is capable of equipping [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]] and [[List_of_Anti-Torpedo_Bulges_by_stats|medium bulges]].

==Trivia==
*Her name means "Morning Frost."
*Sunk in action in Operation Ten-Go, due to engine trouble. Her Secretary (idle) Kai line makes reference to this, as the three mentioned destroyers were also involved in the same operation.
*Her kai art is a reference to Operation Ten-Go(Since she is shown to have an additional 25mm triple autocannon mount for anti air and how she is not smiling as the operation is a serious one.)

*Rare drop from E2, E3, E4 and E5 boss node [[Winter 2015 Event]].

*[[Fall 2015 Event]] E-3 Drop. (Nodes F and H)
*Participated in sinking of submarine USS Trout
