==Character==
*Prefers to be called "Hitomi".

===Appearance===
===Personality===
*I-13, or Hitomi as she prefers to be called, has a shy and soft-spoken demeanor; she stammers whenever she speaks, and is rather timid. Despite that, she still tries to be the responsible elder sister towards [[I-14]].

==Notes==
* She and her sister, [[I-14]], are the first playable submarines with '''3 equipment slots''' after remodeling. I-13 also comes with an unbuildable [[Submarine Radar & Passive Radiolocator (E27)|Submarine Radar &amp; Passive Radiolocator (E27).]], which will give a boost in evasion that is only surpassed by a [[New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler|New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler.]]
* Her aircraft slots are unevenly distributed, but this also comes with a plus side as the player can freely manage her setup more effectively.

==Trivia==
*I-13 was the first of two Type AM (also known as the "I-13 class") submarines, which were developed off the preceding Type A2 class, featuring a much larger aircraft hangar than their predecessors to support the operation of [[Seiran]] seaplane bombers.
*I-13 was part of the four-submarine fleet (alongside [[I-14]], [[I-400]] and [[I-401]]) assigned to ''Operation Arashi'', a planned operation to attack Ulithi Atoll, at the time the US Navy's largest naval base in the Pacific, near the end of the war in July 1945. I-13 and I-14 were to participate in ''Operation Hikari'', a preceding operation which involved the delivery of [[Saiun]] recon aircraft to Truk Anchorage in preparation for the attack.
*I-13 was sunk en route to Truk Anchorage only 5 days after departure on July 16, 1945 by destroyer escort ''USS Lawrence C. Taylor'' and escort carrier ''USS Anzio'', who were conducting anti-submarine missions at the time.
*The nickname ''Hitomi'' (ひとみ, 瞳) means pupil (of the eye), and is a common Japanese female name.
