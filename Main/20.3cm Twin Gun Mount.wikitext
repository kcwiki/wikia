* Equipped historically as the standard main guns for all Japanese heavy cruisers. Initially it was developed as 20 cm single mount (as seen on early Furutaka class) but was later modified to fit 8 in (20.3 cm). 
* Can also be equipped on light cruisers, since in the KanColle world "there's no naval treaty". However in an interview with Japanese Febri magazine, the line appeared as "20.3 cm guns equipped on light cruisers will not be able to show 100% efficiency", although there is no quantitative data to prove the fact.
