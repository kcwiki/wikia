==Strategy== <!-- Detailed events -->

The [[Anime/Characters#Nagato|Secretary Ship]] is ready to sacrifice everything & her [[Anime/Characters#Mutsu|aide]] can only be there for her....

The [[#Naval Base Fleets|Sixth Destroyer Division]] is seen in the docks, washing up. Once again, [[Anime/Characters#Akagi|Akagi]] is there & occupying herself with something to pass the time. Much to Akagi's delight, they are an [[Expedition|expedition]] fleet that have gained excellent [[Tutorial:_FAQ#How_do_resources_work_in_this_game.3F|bauxite]] rewards.

Though once done, [[Akatsuki]] is displeased about her goal of becoming a [[#Trivia|lady]]. They notice a flyer to the yearly ''Naval Base Curry Tournament'' & [[Takao]] & [[Atago]] explain it as they pass by. Naturally, Akatsuki focuses upon the comment of being the number one cook as a shortcut in being a lady. As such, at Mamiya's Cafe she persuades the rest of DesDiv6 to join as well. When they cheer themselves on, [[Kongou]] suddenly joins in. Both Ashigara & her won't let the chance slide by either. Though for....differing reasons.

In a kitchen, they begin their practice. However, they are impatient during the stewing & at the construction area, speed it up with....undesirable results. As they reaffirm their commitment, [[Yuubari]] helps them with a new pot & [[NPC|Mamiya]] assists them with ingredients. Their expedition for it fails, though. As they contemplate resigning, [[Nagato]] steps in to encourage them.

The competition beings with the teams of Kongou & [[Hiei]], [[Shoukaku]] & [[Zuikaku]], [[Akagi]] & [[Kaga]], [[Shimakaze]], Ashigara & [[Haguro]], & DesDiv6. The Secretary Ship is the judge. Surprisingly, or unsurprisingly, teams begin to drop out due to self-inflicted sabotage. However, one of the remaining teams lays on a heavy revelation. It takes Nagato to step in once more to reinvigorate DesDiv6 & the audience to continue challenging [[Ashigara|THE BOSS]].

Once the time is up, the Secretary Ship tastes Ashigara & Haguro & DesDiv6 dishes. After a [[wikipedia:spicy|hard decision]], DesDiv6 is declared the winner. Everyone has a serving of the winning curry & DesDiv6 has the rest of champions.
