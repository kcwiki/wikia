<div style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px;"> </div>
Starting from Winter 2015 Event, players can choose from the difficulty they want to play on each event map among three available difficulties: Easy (丙), Medium (乙), and Hard (甲).

You need to have a HQ level of 35 for Medium and 80 for hard. Different difficulties yield different rewards with harder ones either giving more items or a better version of the same item. However, ship rewards are always given regardless of difficulty. Drops also differ with some ships available only on medium to hard maps, and drop rates for some ships are statistically better. Enemy compositions also differ with bosses and their escorts are usually weaker on easier difficulties. To finish the next map on Hard, you will need to finish the previous map on Medium or Hard. 

Clearing the last map on Hard (甲) mode will reward a First Class Medal. It is not required to clear all maps on hard but to gain access to last map's hard difficulty, you'll need to clear the pre-final map with Medium or above.

==={{Anchor|map-hp}}[[Events/Mechanics#Difficulty_Selection|Map HP/TP dependent on HQ level]]===

<div style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px;"> </div>
The amount of HP (or TP) required to clear a map usually varies depending on an Admiral's HQ Level. The higher the HQ Level is, the more kills (or TP) may be required to complete a map.

===[[Events/Mechanics#Node_specific_details|Multiple Branching Map]]===

<div style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px;"> </div>
Starting from [[Winter 2016 Event]], the event maps may have multiple starting points which leads to different routes, or even a completely separate routing altogether, and these fleets may encounter entirely different enemies on the way. The starting point of the fleet are dependent on type and composition of the fleet chosen to enter the maps.

<center>[[File:Multiple branching.jpg|400px]]</center>
<div style="text-align:right"> </div>
As you see in the image, there are 3 starting points and 2 ending nodes in E-3 map. The first part is to deplete TP gauge by using a Transport Escort Fleet which starts with node A and ends at node S. And after that the players have the option to use either Surface Task Force (starts with node J) or Carrier Task Force (starts with node E or F) to make their way to the final boss (node T).
