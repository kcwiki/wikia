The fishery didn't know the name of the ships so they were given a list of available ships. The first ship on that list was Nagato.

==Notes==
*In her Kai Ni form, Nagato is capable of equipping [[Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)]], [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft]], [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft + 11th Tank Regiment]], and [[Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank]].
**Nagato Kai Ni is also the only battleship capable of using small-caliber main guns normally exclusive to Destroyers.
{{:Nagato/Special Cut-In}}

==Character==
[[File:Anime nagato.png|thumb|250px]]

=== Appearance ===
On her head is her peculiar headgear which features the various details of the top of her main tower.

===Personality===
*In the anime, Nagato serves as the Admiral's Secretary Ship with Mutsu always alongside her. She is calm and collected and carries a serious, intimidating air about her wherever she goes, making sure the other fleet girls abide by the Navy's rules. She shows great pride in herself as one of the "Big Seven" but is not unsympathetic, as she feigns ignorance when Fubuki, Yuudachi, and Mutsuki secretly take Yamato out of the Fleet's forward base on Truk Island onto the ocean once more on a boat and upon their return, tells them that dinner is ready instead. She also has a rather low tolerance for spicy foods; this is the sole reason as to why she let [[:Category:Akatsuki Class|DesDiv6]] win the curry competition instead of [[Ashigara]] as Nagato couldn't handle the heat of the latter's curry, to which Mutsu later teased her for.

*She is often the one in charge of issuing orders to the fleet and has a keen understanding of the Admiral's intentions even when the Admiral was missing and left behind but coded orders. Nagato is only seen in battle once, demonstrating impressive fire power and even kicking an oncoming Abyssal, during the anime's final battle against Midway Princess. She is the only fleet girl, other than Ooi, to actually use physical combat and take down Midway alongside Mutsu.

*Within the fandom, Nagato has been occasionally depicted as a lover of cute things, usually even subverting her personality in the process. While initially a fan depiction, this trait has since reached enough popularity to be semi-canonized through the anime adaptation, in a scene where she loses her serious demeanor and cuddles a squirrel while speaking in a rather cutesy way. This particular personality is commonly referred to as [https://danbooru.donmai.us/pools/8242 Nagamon], derived from an alternate reading of her character name.

==Trivia==
*Received Kai Ni in the May 22nd 2017 Update.
*Sunk as a target during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads Operation Crossroads] on the 25th of July, 1946. Currently resting upside-down under 110 ft. of water.
*Nagato was both the only surviving Japanese battleship and the only surviving Japanese capital ship after World War II, as well as the only member of the Big Seven that still exists as a ship in some ways (the rest were either scrapped after the war or, as in Mutsu's case, no longer in one piece).
*Her name goes after the Nagato province (western part of today's Yamaguchi prefecture) and is written with the kanji representing "Long" and "Gate".
* Her naval ensign was conveyed after a US Navy Officer's relative found it in his house. It was then introduced on a Japanese TV show in 2005. The MC of the show bought it for ¥10,000,000 (about 83,000 USD) with his own money, and donated it to the [http://www.yamato-museum.com/download-data/ref09_3_eng.pdf Yamato Museum] in Kure city, Hiroshima.
* She was the former flagship of IJN before the position was transferred to [http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Yamato Yamato].
* There had been talk of giving the Nagato back to Japan as a defensive warship in early 1946 after tensions between the United States and the U.S.S.R. rapidly increased. She would have been fully repaired and put back into service to patrol the Japanese coast line for 5 years until the US Navy had put into place enough ships and bases to patrol the waters themselves. Sadly this plan was scrapped in its early stages.
