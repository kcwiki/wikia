=== Main Gun {{RedGunLight}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{GreenGunDP}} ===
* Main equipment used to increase shelling Firepower {{Firepower}}.
* Main Guns with green icon give a better anti-air bonus but generally sacrifice firepower. (not always)
** High Angle /w Built-In Fire Directors are guns with much stronger {{AA}} and are required in some Anti-Air Cut-In setups.
* Types of guns based on caliber and which ships can equip them:
** Small Caliber Gun{{RedGunLight}} / {{GreenGunDP}} - Destroyer, Light Cruiser, Torpedo Cruiser, Seaplane Tender, Amphibious Assault Ship, Repair Ship, Submarine Tender
** Medium Caliber Gun{{RedGunMedium}} - Light Cruiser, Torpedo Cruiser, Heavy Cruiser, Aviation Cruiser, Battleship, Aviation Battleship
** Large Caliber Gun{{RedGunHeavy}} - Battleship, Aviation Battleship, Fast Battleship

* For Large Caliber Guns, 2014/7/28 update [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/493648336142876674 1] [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/493653997522137088 2] introduced the [[Overweight Penalty and Fit Gun Bonus]]. When equipping a gun "fit" to battleship class, there will be an increase in accuracy. Inversely, when equipping multiple guns that are "overweight" for battleship class, there will be a decrease in accuracy.
* Influences double attack/cut-in attack for artillery spotting and night battle.

* Helps in detecting the enemy {{LOS}}. Can trigger Contact during Aerial Phase.
* Some Light Cruisers (Tenryuu-class, Ooi, Kitakami, Yuubari, Isuzu Kai-2) have zero plane count. While they can still equip seaplanes and it still does give them stats and {{LOS}}, it does not allow them to perform [[Artillery Spotting]].
* Recon Seaplane have anti-submarine stat {{ASW}}, but it does not enable any other ships, except CLs to attack submarines.
* There exists a sub-class of recon seaplanes called "Large Flying Boats". They give tremendously more stats than regular seaplanes, but the usefulness is the same and they can only be equipped by {{ShipLink|Akitsushima}}.
* The plane only participates in the detection phase and it has a very small chance of getting shot down if you were to fail the detection.
** Failing the detection is almost impossible under any circumstances, so this is something people shouldn't really ever be worried about.

* Ammunition with special qualities shot from ship's guns. {{RedAmmo}}
* Can be equipped by Battleship and Aviation Battleship. Increases Firepower {{Firepower}} and Accuracy {{Hit}}.
* Affects artillery spotting cut-in, but does not affect night double attack/cut-in.
* Originally could only be equipped by Nagato-class, Yamato-class and Aviation Battleships; but after the 2014/7/28 update, can also be equipped by Fast Battleships.
* After the 2014/10/10 update, when Armor Piercing Shell and Large Caliber Guns are equipped together, the ship will gain a post-cap multiplier damage bonus against CA(V), (F)BB(V) and CV(B). As [[Installation Type|Installation]] bosses are usually classified as one of them, the bonus damage also applies to them.
** This effect however, does not work during the night.
* AP Shells are also extremely effective against [[Installation Type|Hard Installations]] like {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp}}.

* Uses a Searchlight to seek out the enemy, at the risk of being easier to get detected by the enemy as well.
* Fleet's accuracy and cut-in rate increases while enemy fleet's cut-in rate decreases. The stronger the searchlight, the stronger the effect applied.
* Both {{EquipmentLink|Searchlight}} and {{EquipmentLink|Type 96 150cm Searchlight}} are guaranteed to activate, but the ship with it equipped will receive an {{Evasion}} penalty and will also be targeted more often.

===Daihatsus and Anti-Installation===
* Equipment that specializes in increasing your resource gain, allowing you to clear the TP phase faster during events and deals extra damage against certain installation types.
* Since [[Installation]] bosses are immune to {{Torpedo}}, it is essential that you capitalize on their weaknesses. Each Installation is always weak against a certain equipment, so be sure to use them to maximize the amount of damage you can deal.
* The [[Installation]] types are classified in the following:
** Soft Installations
** Hard Installations
** Hybrid installations, who shares some, but not all of the weaknesses of the soft/hard installations, are more resistant than usual, or they have a unusual weaknesses that other installations don't share.

** Using 3 Toku Daihatsus gives you 15% softcap and 5% postcap.
** Using 4 Toku Daihatsus gives you 20% softcap and 5.4% postcap.
* Can be equipped by any tank carrier on the list.

===={{LandingCraft}}{{EquipmentLink|Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)}}====

* Increases resources gained from expeditions. (2% per Type 89, maximum of 20%)
* Can be equipped by any tank carrier on the list.
* The T89 Tank covers more weaknesses than the regular {{EquipmentLink|Daihatsu Landing Craft|text=Daihatsu}} does and is much stronger in this regard.
* Provides a '''strong''' damage bonus against [[Installation Type|Hard Installations]] like {{ShipLink|Artillery Imp}} and most of the [[Installation Type|Hybrid Installations]] like {{ShipLink|Isolated Island Princess}} and {{ShipLink|Supply Depot Princess}}.

* Can only be equipped by Destroyers, Light Cruisers, Submarines and all type of Aviation ships.

* The efficiency of the {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|text=WG42}} depends completely on what kind of installation you're fighting, but it's generally very strong. However, each extra {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|text=WG42}} you equip on the same ship will grant diminishing returns on both flat and multiplier bonuses.
** Flat power boosts are always +75 for the first {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|text=WG42}}, +110 on the second.
** For example: against {{ShipLink|Isolated Island Princess}}, you are given both a 1.4x pre-cap multiplier and a +75 {{Firepower}} bonus on top of that. With 2x {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|text=WG42}}, that becomes 2.1x and a boost of +110 {{Firepower}}, which is very strong.
** However, against {{ShipLink|Supply Depot Princess}} for example, you are given both a flat power boost and a '''post-cap''' multiplier, meaning that the multiplier only takes place after all the other pre-cap modifiers have taken place. This boosts the damages to a ridiculous amount, which is only made possible through the {{EquipmentLink|WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|text=WG42}}

* Allows a Destroyer to tow a heavily damaged (<span style="color:red">'''大破'''</span>) ship back to the base and allows the current fleet to continue the sortie with 2 ships less.
** Both the Destroyer and the heavily damaged ship who got towed back will be drained of all fuel and morale.
* For this to work, you are required to have the {{EquipmentLink|Fleet Command Facility}} equipped on the '''flagship''' of the '''main fleet''' and when a ship gets heavily damaged, you are required to have at least a healthy destroyer available that is not in any damage state and also not the flagship, on the '''escort''' fleet.
** In case you have multiple healthy destroyers, the order gets chosen from top to bottom. The flagship cannot be chosen, even if the flagship is a Destroyer.
* A retreat can only trigger once, so in case you have multiple ships who are heavily damaged in the same node, you will not be able to tow all of them back and you will be forced to retreat if you don't want to risk sinking your ships.
